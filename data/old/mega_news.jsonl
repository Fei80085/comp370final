A federal judge in Portland earlier this month issued a permanent block on troop deployments to the city in response to demonstrations against Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\nMatt Hill, a spokesman for Gov. JB Pritzker of Illinois, said state officials had not yet been notified of the Pentagon's action.\n\n\"While there are reports the Texas guard is leaving, the Trump Administration is also saying they will keep federalizing national guards to 'ensure a constant, enduring, and long-term presence' in cities,\" Mr. Hill posted on social media. \"Illinois will continue fighting for our state sovereignty, protecting people's rights, and keeping our communities peaceful.\"\n\nA federal judge in Illinois issued a temporary restraining order last month blocking the Trump administration's deployment of National Guard troops in the Chicago area. An appeals panel later upheld the lower-court judge's decision and the U.S. Supreme Court is now weighing the issue.\n\nIn California, officials in the office of Gov. Gavin Newsom, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the federal deployment, said Northern Command had notified them that it would begin drawing down the California National Guard from Portland as early as Sunday.\n\nA spokesman for the governor, Izzy Gardon, applauded the decision, but also condemned the deployment, which has gone on since June and has been authorized to extend into next year. Last week, California asked the federal court again to halt the deployment in that state and release the remaining 300 federalized California National Guard troops.\n\nThe president \"never should have illegally deployed our troops in the first place,\" Mr. Gardon said. \"We're glad they're finally coming home.

Gavin Newsom's office acknowledged the revocations but rejected the claim that they were illegal immigrants. It said they were booted because of \"inconsistency\" with state law.\n\n\"After weeks of claiming they did nothing wrong, Gavin Newsom and California have been caught red-handed. Now that we've exposed their lies, 17,000 illegally issued trucking licenses are being revoked,\" Mr. Duffy said.\n\nMr. Newsom's office, for its part, mocked Mr. Duffy for his role on MTV's reality TV show \"Road Rules\" in the 1990s and said he was \"spreading easily disproven falsehoods in a sad and desperate attempt to please his 'dear leader.'\"\n\nAs that back-and-forth was playing out, however, a federal appeals court put a hold on Mr. Duffy's new regulation aimed at stripping illegal immigrants and other \"non-domiciled\" foreign drivers off the road.\n\nThe U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, in a 2-1 ruling, said Mr. Duffy cut too many corners in issuing the rule -- and said the foreign drivers at issue are actually safer than other commercial drivers.\n\nThey also said the migrants themselves, as well as the economy, have come to rely on the migrant drivers and taking them off the road \"would have public safety by forcing it to replace safer experienced drivers with less-safe new drivers.\"\n\nU.S. Circuit Judge Karen Henderson, a George H.W. Bush appointee, dissented, saying she thought the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration made a good showing of the need for the rule, which she said should have been good enough at this point in the litigation.\n\nThe rule at issue limited states' ability to issue commercial driver's licenses to people whose addresses were foreign domiciles but who live in the U.S.\n\nThe government said those drivers fell into a loophole.\n\nBecause much of their driving history exists in their home countries, states struggle to make determinations on whether they should be granted licenses.\n\nJudge Henderson said that made sense, and it was an error for the court to substitute its judgment for the government.\n\n\"It should go without saying that our nation's roadways are safer the fewer people there are operating eighteen-wheelers, buses and delivery trucks with unchecked driving histories,\" she wrote.\n\nShe said the government also provided examples of five recent fatal crashes -- which claimed 12 lives -- involving foreign-domiciled commercial drivers. She said an audit of their foreign records might have denied them permits.\n\nIt's not clear what effect the court ruling will have on the 17,000 revoked licenses in California. Neither that state's motor vehicle bureau nor the U.S. Transportation Department responded to inquiries for this story.\n\nMr. Duffy said the 17,000 were \"just the tip of the iceberg.\"\n\n\"My team will continue to force California to prove they have removed every illegal immigrant from behind the wheel of semitrucks and school buses,\" he said.\n\nMr. Newsom's press office denied the label \"illegal immigrant,\" saying they had \"legal presence\" and had been issued work permits by Homeland Security.\n\nWork permits can, in fact, be issued to migrants who are here without a legal visa.\n\nAs one example, the Biden administration granted millions of illegal border crossers \"parole,\" giving them the tentative legal presence Mr. Newsom's office cited. But they are still inadmissible aliens, or what would usually be considered illegal immigrants.\n\nMr. Duffy also said that California issued driver's licenses that are valid for years after their work permits expire.\n\n\"Blatantly lying to the American people won't help Newsom's keyboard warriors get their next jobs,\" the secretary said.\n\nHe said California was a major reason he issued the non-domiciled driver rule.\n\nThe Transportation Department said Wednesday that it will continue to urge California to revoke all illegal non-domiciled CDLs or risk losing $160 million in federal funds.", "url": "https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2025/nov/16/california-yanks-illegal-immigrants-truckers-licenses-newsom-says/"}

Critics alleged that despite recurring wildfire risk, authorities had not done enough in advance to mitigate the danger. Among the issues raised were water supply problems and firefighting resources being stretched or compromised.\n\nMany residents and some local officials have expressed frustration with the slow recovery in the wake of the fires, citing bureaucratic challenges, significant delays with permitting, insurance disputes, and infrastructure concerns.\n\nDANICA MCKELLAR EXPLAINS WHY LA HAS LOST ITS APPEAL AS MORE CELEBRITIES FLEE HOLLYWOOD\n\nDuring Dye's appearance on the podcast, the comedian and Rogan also slammed celebrities who declared that they would leave the United States if President Donald Trump was re-elected.\n\n\"They go, 'I'm going to move.'

Hundreds wore red shirts, symbolizing the blood of colleagues fighting to protect the environment. And others chanted, waved huge flags or held up signs Saturday in what's traditionally the biggest day of protest at the halfway point of annual United Nations climate talks.\n\nOrganizers with booming sound systems on trucks with raised platforms directed protesters from a wide range of environmental and social movements. Marisol Garcia, a Kichwa woman from Peru marching at the head of one group, said protesters are there to put pressure on world leaders to make \"more humanized decisions.\"\n\nThe demonstrators walked about 2.5 miles on a route that took them near the main venue for the talks, known as COP30. Protesters earlier this week twice disrupted the talks by surrounding the venue, including an incident on Tuesday where two security guards suffered minor injuries.\n\nA full day of sessions was planned at the venue, including talks on how to move forward with $300 billion a year in annual climate financial aid that rich countries agreed last year to give to poor nations to help wean themselves off fossil fuels, adapt to a nastier, warmer world and compensate for extreme weather damage. Global temperatures, greenhouse gas emissions and sea levels all reached record highs in 2024, the State of the Global Climate report confirmed.\n\nMany of the protesters reveled in the freedom to demonstrate more openly than at recent climate talks held in more authoritarian countries, including Azerbaijan, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt. Thousands of people joined in a procession that sprawled across most of the march's route.\n\nYouth leader Ana Heloisa Alves, 27, said it was the biggest climate march she has been part of. \"This is incredible,\" she said. \"You can't ignore all these people.\"\n\nAlves was at the march to fight for the Tapajos River, which the Brazilian government wants to develop commercially. \"The river is for the people,\" her group's signs read.\n\nPablo Neri, coordinator in the Brazilian state of Para for the Movimento dos Trabajadores Rurais Sem Terra, an organization for rural workers, said organizers of the talks should involve more people to reflect a climate movement that is shifting toward popular participation.\n\nThe United States, where President Trump has ridiculed climate change as a scam, is skipping the talks. This is the second time the Trump administration has withdrawn from the 10-year-old Paris Agreement, which is being celebrated as a partial achievement here in Belem.\n\nfPresident Trump's actions damage the fight against climate change, former U.S. Special Envoy for Climate Todd Stern said.\n\n\"It's a good thing that they are not sending anyone. It wasn't going to be constructive if they did,\" he said.\n\nTwo U.S. governors, California's Gavin Newsom and New Mexico's Michelle Lujan Grisham, were in Brazil to attend the summit, representing state-level U.S. efforts to curb emissions. Newsom, a Democrat, criticized the Trump administration's decision not to attend, saying earlier in the week that Brazil is a country the U.S. \"should be engaging with, not slapping with 50% tariffs.\"\n\nOne demonstrator, Flavio Pinto, from Para state, took aim at the U.S. Wearing a brown suit and an oversized American flag top hat, he shifted his weight back and forth on stilts and fanned himself with fake hundred-dollar bills with Trump's face on them. \"Imperialism produces wars and environmental crises,\" his sign read.\n\nVitoria Balbina, a regional coordinator for the Interstate Movement of Coconut Breakers of Baba\u00e7u, marched with a group of mostly women wearing domed hats made with fronds of the Baba\u00e7u palm. They were calling for more access to the trees on private property that provide not only their livelihoods but also a deep cultural significance. She said marching is not only about fighting and resistance on a climate and environment front, but also about \"a way of life.\"\n\nThe marchers formed a sea of red, white and green flags as they progressed up a hill. A crowd of onlookers gathered outside a corner supermarket to watch them approach, leaning over a railing and taking cellphone photos. \"Beautiful,\" said a man passing by, carrying grocery bags.\n\nThe climate talks are scheduled to run through Friday. Analysts and some participants have said they don't expect any major new agreements to emerge from the talks, but are hoping for progress on some past promises, including money to help poor countries adapt to climate change.", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/climate-protesters-march-on-cop30-costumes-and-drums/"}

But other crimes like homicides, rapes, property crimes and arson have come down modestly from levels in 2024. In many categories, Charlotte's current crime levels are meaningfully lower than rates in 2022 and 2023, with some exceptions.\n\nOn Aug. 22, the stabbing of Ukrainian refugee Iryna Zarutska garnered attention after her killing was captured on surveillance video while she was commuting home from her pizzeria job.

He is currently running for California governor.\n\nFederal court documents allege that, unknown to Becerra, McCluskie stole $225 thousand worth of Becerra's dormant campaign funds for his personal use.\n\nWilliamson is alleged to have helped facilitate it alongside Campbell, a high-profile political consultant.

Earlier this week, California revoked 17,000 commercial driver's licenses because of that problem. Those licenses were invalidated under the older existing rules - not by the new proposed restrictions affected by this court order.\n\nThe court ruling focused on procedural issues such as whether the Transportation Department properly consulted with states before issuing the new rules.\n\n\"This is not a ruling on the merits of the case. Secretary Duffy will continue working to keep unqualified, foreign drivers off American roads,\" a Transportation Department spokesman said.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom's office didn't respond immediately Friday to questions about the ruling. Newsom's office has said the state followed guidance it received from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security when issuing these licenses to noncitizens.\n\nDuffy has said the Florida crash, along with fatal truck crashes in Texas and Alabama earlier this year, highlighted questions about these licenses. A fiery California crash that killed three people last month involved a truck driver in the country illegally, only added to the concerns.\n\nThe driver in the Florida crash, Harjinder Singh, appeared before a judge in St. Lucie County, Florida, on Thursday, where his attorneys asked to continue his court proceedings into January as they prepare for trial. Singh has pleaded not guilty to three counts of vehicular homicide and three counts of manslaughter.\n\nThe new restrictions on these licenses would only allow immigrants who hold three specific classes of visas to be eligible to get the licenses. States would also have to verify an applicant's immigration status in a federal database. The licenses would be valid for up to one year unless the applicant's visa expires sooner.\n\nUnder the new rules, only 10,000 of the 200,000 noncitizens who have commercial licenses would qualify for them, which would only be available to drivers who have an H-2a, H-2b or E-2 visa. H-2a is for temporary agricultural workers while H-2b is for temporary nonagricultural workers, and E-2 is for people who make substantial investments in a U.S. business. But the rules won't be enforced retroactively, so those 190,000 drivers would be allowed to keep their commercial licenses at least until they come up for renewal.\n\nTrucking trade groups like the Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association have supported the new rule. There is a bill in Congress that would enshrine the new restrictions on commercial driver's licenses in law.\n\n\"For too long, loopholes in this program have allowed unqualified drivers onto our highways, putting professional truckers and the motoring public at risk,\" said Todd Spencer, the trucking association's president.\n\nDuffy has said that California and five other states had improperly issued commercial driver's licenses to noncitizens, but California is the only state Duffy has taken action against because it was the first one where an audit was completed. The reviews in the other states have been delayed by the government shutdown, but the Transportation Department is urging all of them to tighten their standards.\n\nDuffy has revoked $40 million in federal funding because he said California isn't enforcing English language requirements for truckers, and he said earlier this week that he may take another $160 million from the state over these improperly issued licenses if they don't invalidate every illegal license and address all the concerns.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Kate Payne contributed to this report from Tallahassee, Florida.", "url": "https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2025/nov/14/court-blocking-new-rules-limiting-immigrants-get-commercial-drivers/"}

Although California's governor made headlines with his remarks, there is no official U.S. delegation, marking the first time that the world's largest economy -- and historically the world's largest carbon emitter -- has refused to participate in global efforts to reduce the harm of climate change.\n\nOn one level, America skipping out on the multilateral talks places a ceiling on just how much effect any commitments made at the conference will have on reducing carbon emissions globally. But in Trump's second term, America has transformed from a potential roadblock during climate talks into an aggressive antagonist. By pulling back from the discussions underway in Bel\u00e9m, President Donald Trump may have given them a greater chance of success than otherwise would have existed.\n\nIt was clear before Trump returned to office that clean-energy technology was not part of his agenda. A centerpiece of his campaign was denouncing the \"Green New Scam,\" as he called it, promising to roll back the Biden administration's climate achievements and investments in renewable energy. In its place would be a set of policies campaign officials described as working to \"maximize fossil fuel production\" -- or, in Trump's words, \"drill, baby, drill.\"\n\nTwo years ago, as another round of climate talks began, I described those Trump campaign proposals as plans to \"kill us all even faster.\" Amazingly, that might have been an understatement, because for the Trump administration's strategy for American energy dominance to succeed, global moves away from fossil fuels must be kneecapped. Rather than merely ignoring the rest of the world's efforts to forestall rising temperatures as we make polluters great again at home, what little progress other countries have made must also be rolled back.\n\nAccordingly, U.S. diplomats have begun impeding multilateral efforts to address climate issues. Last month, the United States tanked an International Maritime Organization deal that would have required global shipping vessels to reduce their emissions or be forced to pay a fee. The treaty was all but done when the Trump administration swooped in, threatening economic sanctions against countries that agreed to the pact as well as pledging to turn away their ships from American ports. Similarly, long-running discussions to set a limit on global plastic pollution were scuttled this summer in the face of administration obstinance. As The Washington Post noted, the plastics industry has become \"a crucial growth market for fossil fuel companies at a time when solar power and electric vehicle uptake is expected to eat into demand.\"\n\nIt's hard then to see, then, what good an official U.S. presence might have achieved in Brazil. If anything, the absence of administration representatives is more likely a blessing in disguise, given that the negotiations rely on consensus. As a follow-up to the Paris Agreement's goal of holding global warming to 1.5 C above preindustrial levels, COP30 is focused on nations implementing their previous pledges to reduce emissions. As things stand, though, the world is set to blow by the 2015 goal in the coming years as temperatures continue to rise unabated, prompting even more chaotic and destructive weather patterns than we are already feeling.\n\nStill, there are some Americans at the summit. California's Gov. Gavin Newsom is making the rounds in Brazil, taking swings at the president and presenting himself as an avatar of the post-Trump era. Beyond the obvious political calculations, Newsom's presence speaks to California's importance on the global stage. The state's economy on its own is equivalent to the fourth-largest in the world, and the standards it sets for emissions and more have a deep impact on how companies everywhere do business. California is part of the U.S. Climate Alliance, a group of 24 states and U.S. territories that have pledged to reduce greenhouse gases regardless of the White House's stance.\n\nThe effort mirrors the strategy of COP 30 host country Brazil toward ensuring the summit's success. As Foreign Policy reported, Brazil's \"approach to COP30 is what some climate strategists call 'coalitions of the doing.' Rather than waiting for absolute consensus among U.N. member states, Brazil is moving in smaller groups to push action forward and emphasizing how climate action can lead to economic development.\" Those states only have to look to China's growth in renewable energies, which makes up 10% of its entire economy, to see that there's real potential to tap into that growth themselves.\n\nThe idea that America should be on the forefront of developing and scaling new, profitable technologies rather than playing defense for oil and coal is heretical to this administration. Instead, Washington has focused on producing ever more carbon-spewing fuels. Couple that with an obsession with artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency -- which both demand vast amounts of energy to power their data centers and water to cool them -- and the Trump administration's vision is an America that is increasingly harmful to the planet's long-term survival. Thankfully, the rest of the world isn't waiting for us to get our act together before trying to avoid the impending climate disaster that Trump, disbelieving facts and science, derides as a hoax.", "url": "https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-skips-cop30-brazil-climate-change-us-rcna243351"}

Gavin Newsom announced on Thursday that emergency resources will be pre-deployed ahead of the storm to protect communities in the Los Angeles, Orange and Ventura counties from mudslides and debris flows.\n\nOn average, Los Angeles records 0.8 inches of rain the entire month of November, with the record being 9.68 inches in 1965. This storm beginning on Friday could likely be more than a November months' worth of rain within a day for these areas.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/US/millions-flood-watches-evacuation-orders-place-southern-california/story?id=127523533"}

We're done waiting for Democrats to find their spine,\" Ezra Levin, co-founder and co-executive director of Indivisible, said in a Monday press release. \"We can't afford a weak and cowardly Democratic Party while the authoritarians invade our cities, terrorize our communities, and threaten our democracy. We get the party we demand, and we intend to demand a Democratic Party that fights.\"\n\nIndivisible is one of the key groups behind the massive \"No Kings\" protests that were held across the country earlier in 2024, including on June 14, when Trump held a military parade in Washington, D.C., and most recently on Oct. 18, when protesters railed against Trump's immigration policies and reiterated claims that Trump conducts himself as a monarch as opposed to a president.\n\nThe protests are supported by dozens of left-wing and liberal groups, with Indivisible, the 50501 movement and the No Kings Organization, itself, identified as the top organizers of the protests.\n\nSCHUMER PUSHES SHUTDOWN INTO RECORD BOOKS AFTER REJECTING GOP BILL A 14TH TIME\n\nIndivisible launched in 2017, as Trump's first term kicked off, and describes itself as a network of local grassroots groups that advocates for the elections of left-wing lawmakers, while advocating current lawmakers resist MAGA policies. The group is funded, in part, by left-wing billionaire George Soros' Open Society Foundations, which delivered Indivisible a two-year grant worth $3 million in 2023 that works to \"to support the grantee's social welfare activities,\" Fox News Digital previously reported.\n\n\"Chuck Schumer and a critical mass of Senate Democrats surrendered,\" Levin said. \"For nearly six weeks, Republicans held the government hostage while threatening health care, food assistance, and basic services for millions of Americans.\"\n\n\"In these six weeks of the shutdown, Democrats had their best election night in over a decade, polls showed Republicans were losing this shutdown fight, and their base turned out for the largest protest in modern U.S. history with a resounding rejection of Trump and Republicans,\" Levin continued in his comments. \"Instead of standing with that energy, Senate Democrats surrendered - yet again. That's why Indivisible is launching our largest primary program yet.\"\n\nSeven Senate Democrats and Independent Sen. Angus King, who caucuses with the Democrats, splintered with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer Sunday evening to vote in favor of passing a revamped plan to reopen the government. The government has been shut down since Oct. 1, becoming the longest federal government shutdown in U.S. history.\n\nIn addition to King, Sens. John Fetterman, D-Pa., Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nev., Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., Maggie Hassan, D-N.H., Jacky Rosen, D-Nev., Tim Kaine, D-Va., and Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin, D-Ill, joined the Republicans.\n\n\"Our democracy is facing an existential threat. We need leaders with backbone and conviction -- not timidity and excuses,\" Indivisible's co-founder and co-executive director Leah Greenberg said of the primary plan. \"Democrats can't defeat authoritarianism by running from the fight. It's in our hands to make sure those who can't fight make space for the leaders who can. Indivisible is ready to clean house and build a party that actually has the energy to act like an opposition.\"\n\nAt the heart of the shutdown was a debate on healthcare. Trump and Republican pinned shutdown blame on Democrats for working to include healthcare benefits for illegal immigrants in the package. Democrats denied the claims and argued the government was shut down due to Republicans failing to negotiate healthcare demands.\n\nThe House voted later Wednesday to reopen the government. The bill then headed to Trump's desk for his signature to officially end the longest federal shutdown in U.S. history.\n\nA handful of left-wing lawmakers and leaders slammed Senate Democrats for joining the GOP earlier this week, such as Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders describing Sunday as a \"very bad night.\"\n\nJOHN FETTERMAN BREAKS WITH DEMOCRATS IN SHUTDOWN VOTE, SAYS IT'S AN 'EASY CHOICE' TO PUT AMERICA FIRST\n\n\"Pathetic. This isn't a deal. It's a surrender. Don't bend the knee!,\" Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom's official press office X account posted Sunday evening. Newsom added on his own X account: \"America deserves better,\" as well as another message that just read, \"pathetic.\"\n\n\"As this vote moves to the House, I stand with Democratic leadership as they refuse to rubber stamp the full-scale Republican assault on Americans' health care and I am proud of the majority of Senate Democrats who opposed this vote,\" DNC Chair Ken Martin posted to X.\n\n\"I've said it since the start of this shutdown -- Republicans do not negotiate in good faith, and any deal that fails to protect healthcare is not a deal at all. For Democrats to cave now would be a complete betrayal of the American people,\" Illinois Lt. Governor and Senate candidate Juliana Stratton posted to X.\n\nOthers, including Indivisible and Democratic California Rep. Ro Khanna, have called for Schumer to be replaced over the handling of the shutdown.\n\nIndivisible's primary plan, which is dubbed as the group's \"largest\" primary effort to date, includes calling on Schumer to step aside as Senate minority leader, and backing Senate candidates who hold a \"clear commitment to abandon the status quo of feckless leadership, and use every tool available to fight MAGA attacks on our communities, our health, and our democracy.\"\n\n\"Ahead of the 2026 primaries, Indivisible will be activating (it's) (sic) network to support progressive fighters who are challenging feckless, status-quo-loving incumbents.

He graduated with a BA in Journalism from CSUS.\n\nA majority of voters in seven California counties won by President Trump in 2024 also supported Proposition 50 in a special election earlier this month, helping pass the redistricting measure championed by Gov. Gavin Newsom and legislative Democrats.\n\nData show that ballots cast to approve Prop. 50 -- which passed with 64% of the vote -- outnumbered \"no\" votes in Fresno, Imperial, Lake, Merced, Riverside, San Bernardino and San Joaquin counties, each of which was carried by Mr. Trump in the last presidential election. No California counties that voted for Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election voted no on Proposition 50, according to data from the California Secretary of State's Office (SOS) for both elections.\n\nProp. 50 temporarily redraws five of the state's Republican-held congressional districts to make them more favorable to being won by Democrats in the 2026 midterms. It was placed on the ballot by Democratic lawmakers hoping to offset redistricting efforts in Texas that flipped five Democratic districts to Republican.\n\nAccording to the measure, the nonpartisan California Citizens Redistricting Commission will resume drawing the state's congressional maps after the 2030 U.S. Census.\n\nIt remains unclear why a majority of voters in the seven counties Trump won cast their ballots in support of Prop. 50. An October CBS News poll conducted before the election found that 75% of the likely voters surveyed who planned to vote for Prop. 50 said one of the reasons they were doing so was to oppose Mr. Trump. Seventy percent of likely voters polled who were voting \"yes\" on the measure said another reason they were doing so was to oppose national Republicans.\n\nHere's what to know about the California counties where most voters approved Prop. 50:\n\nFresno County, the second-most-populous county in California's Central Valley, voted for a Republican in a presidential election for the first time in 20 years in 2024, with 51% of the vote going to Mr. Trump, according to the California Secretary of State's (SOS) Office.\n\nIn the Nov. 4 special election, 51% of Fresno County voters said \"Yes\" to Prop. 50, according to state data as of Nov. 12, narrowly surpassing the 49% of voters who rejected the measure.\n\nSitting on the southern border, Imperial County is 85% Latino, according to 2023 U.S. Census data. In the 2024 presidential election, Mr. Trump won the county with 49% of the vote, according to data from the SOS, making him the first Republican presidential candidate to do so since 1988.\n\nIn the Nov. 4 special election, 60% of Imperial County voters approved Proposition 50, as of Nov. 12.\n\nLake County, which contains Clear Lake and a portion of California's Wine Country, voted Republican last year in a presidential election for the first time since Ronald Reagan carried the county in 1984.\n\nMr. Trump narrowly won the county in 2024. Proposition 50 passed there with 52% of the vote, as of Nov. 12.\n\nThe Central Valley's Merced County has started leaning more conservative in recent years. After voting Democrat in every presidential election since 2008, the county voted to recall Newsom in 2021 and voted against him in 2022.\n\nIn the 2024 presidential election, 51% of the vote went to Mr. Trump. The county approved Proposition 50 with 54% of voters saying yes, as of Nov. 13.\n\nDemocrats won Riverside County in presidential elections from 2008 to 2020. But in 2024, Mr. Trump narrowly defeated then-Vice President Kamala Harris, receiving 49% to 48%.\n\n\"Yes\" on Prop. 50, however, received 56% of the vote in Riverside County, as of Nov. 12.\n\nTwo of the Republicans who are impacted by Proposition 50, Reps. Ken Calvert and Darrell Issa, currently represent districts that include portions of Riverside County. Calvert's district is entirely within Riverside County, while Issa's current district includes portions of Riverside and San Diego counties.\n\nSan Bernardino County held steady in presidential elections, voting Democratic from 2008 to 2020 before going for Mr. Trump in 2024.\n\nProp. 50 passed with 57% of the vote, as of Nov. 13, marking a significant change from Mr. Trump's 50% in last year's election.\n\nMr. Trump earned a narrow victory in San Joaquin County in 2024 with 48.69% of the vote, edging out Harris by about 2,000 of the more than 264,000 votes cast. He was the first Republican presidential candidate to carry the county since George W. Bush in 2004.", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/sanfrancisco/news/california-counties-trump-2024-proposition-50/"}

Gavin Newsom of California and James Comey, the former director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\n\nBut as time wore on, right-wing media figures began coalescing around another approach: focusing on a single redacted name in the emails.\n\nThey argued that Democrats on the House Oversight Committee -- who had released three emails early on Wednesday -- had created a false narrative by hiding the name of one of Mr. Epstein's victims in one of the messages. The redaction, the theory went, was meant to cover up that the victim, Virginia Giuffre, previously said she had never witnessed Mr. Trump involved in sexual abuse of minors.\n\n\"This was done intentionally,\" Rob Schmitt, a Newsmax anchor, wrote in an early-afternoon post on X that quickly spread widely. He followed up with a selfie-style video in a gym. \"This is how sick and twisted these people are,\" Mr. Schmitt said in the video, which he shared on Rumble. \"They are vile creatures. This is what we're up against.\"\n\nIn the dependably administration-friendly world of conservative media, the question of how to address the president's relationship with Mr. Epstein has proved particularly thorny. It has pitted abiding loyalty to Mr. Trump against growing demands from the MAGA base that the federal government release all its files related to the notorious predator.\n\nBut the unified response to this week's disclosures shows how closely aligned right-wing media voices are with elected Republicans and the degree to which the two share story lines -- and provide each other political cover. Indeed, the core message that ended up emanating from conservative media this week originated within the Oversight Committee itself, which jumped on the redaction question less than an hour after the three emails dropped.\n\n\"Why did Democrats cover up the name?\" Republicans on the committee asked on X, adding: \"Democrats are trying to create a fake narrative to slander President Trump.\"\n\nThe White House also jumped into the conversation. \"The 'unnamed victim' referenced in these emails is the late Virginia Giuffre, who repeatedly said President Trump was not involved in any wrongdoing whatsoever,\" Karoline Leavitt said in a statement midday Wednesday. She called the redactions an effort to \"smear President Trump.\"\n\nAlthough the committee also released some 23,000 pages of additional correspondence from Mr. Epstein on Wednesday, including dozens of messages discussing the president in sometimes unflattering terms, pro-Trump outlets accordingly fixated on that one redacted email.\n\n\"So far, they have proved NOTHING NEGATIVE against President Trump,\" wrote David Freeman, an influencer who posts on X under the account name Gunther Eagleman and has 1.6 million followers.\n\nAccording to House Democrats, there is no conspiracy: They redacted the name because of a standing practice on the committee not to name victims of sexual abuse. In August, Representative James R. Comer of Kentucky, the Republican chairman of the committee, said in a statement that he would release documents related to the Justice Department's investigation only after ensuring that \"the identification of victims and any child sexual abuse material are redacted.\"\n\nLater that month, the committee subpoenaed Mr. Epstein's estate and since then has released multiple batches of documents, totaling tens of thousands of pages, with redactions. The large dump on Wednesday was no different, peppered by blacked-out sections presumably hiding names and other identifying information.\n\nBut after Ms. Leavitt's remarks on Wednesday, Republicans on the committee released an unredacted copy of the email that the Democrats had put out, in apparent violation of the committee's policy. It confirmed that Ms. Giuffre was the person named by Mr. Epstein in the 2011 email.\n\nMs. Giuffre died in April; her family said it was by suicide. In a 2016 deposition, she testified that while Mr. Trump and Mr. Epstein were good friends, she didn't \"think Donald Trump had participated in anything.\" In her memoir, released after her death this year, she said that \"Trump couldn't have been friendlier,\" and never publicly accused him of wrongdoing.\n\nHouse Democrats have stood firm on the question of redactions.\n\n\"We don't confirm or deny the names of victims,\" said Sara Guerrero, a spokeswoman for Democrats on the Oversight Committee. She added that they \"have promised all survivors and their families that we will keep their identities private out of respect for them, and our commitment is that we redact all of their names from these documents.\"\n\nBut right-wing outlets have continued to make their argument that Democrats had deliberately cooked up a controversy and that there was, they said, nothing to see here.\n\n\"Democrats tried to frame Donald Trump and got caught the same day, and it is insane,\" Tim Pool, a podcaster, said on his show Thursday morning.\n\nHe, like many other conservative commenters, also latched on to the fact that in a number of the emails, the journalist Michael Wolff gave advice to Mr. Epstein about Mr. Trump. Mr. Pool called it \"evidence of collusion\" to damage the president's reputation.\n\n\"Trump never did anything wrong,\" Mr. Pool said, without addressing any of the thousands of other emails released this week.\n\nBenny Johnson, a right-wing podcaster and staunch supporter of the president, framed it in starker terms. \"They should be sued for this,\" he said of congressional Democrats on his podcast on Thursday. \"They didn't expose President Trump.\"", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/14/business/media/epstein-trump-emails-conservative-media.html"}

In the months since then, moves to draw new congressional districts have swept the nation.\n\nThe new California maps would make it easier for Democrats to win as many as five of California's congressional seats that are now held by Republicans.

Civil rights advocates have argued that the new boundaries in Texas and Missouri illegally disadvantage minority communities at the ballot box.\n\nCalifornia voters overwhelmingly approved Proposition 50, a constitutional amendment changing the congressional boundaries to give Democrats a shot at winning five seats now held by Republicans in next year's midterm elections.\n\nThe Justice Department is joining a case challenging the new map that was brought by the California Republican Party last week. The Trump administration accuses California of racial gerrymandering in violation of the Constitution by using race as a factor to favor Hispanic voters with the new map. It asks a judge to prohibit California from using the new map in any future elections.\n\n\"Race cannot be used as a proxy to advance political interests, but that is precisely what the California General Assembly did with Proposition 50 - the recent ballot initiative that junked California's pre-existing electoral map in favor of a rush-job rejiggering of California's congressional district lines,\" the lawsuit says.\n\nProp 50 was Newsom's response to Trump's maneuvers in Texas, where Republicans rejiggered districts in hopes of picking up five seats of their own ahead of the 2026 midterm elections, when House control will be on the line.\n\nDemocrats need to gain just a handful of seats next year to take control of the chamber, which would imperil Trump's agenda for the remainder of his term and open the way for congressional investigations into his administration.

Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., is eyeing a new workplace: the California governor's mansion.\n\nAccording to two sources familiar with the matter who were granted anonymity to discuss the congressman's private plans, Swalwell has all but decided he is running for governor, with one of the sources saying he has even been discussing an announcement as early as next week.\n\nSwalwell declined to comment when reached by MSNBC, but a source close to the congressman, who asked to remain anonymous to discuss the private discussions, said Swalwell allies had asked him to run \"to fill a 'fighter/protector' role\" in the mold of Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom.\n\nThe news about Swalwell comes days after Sen. Alex Padilla, D-Calif., announced he would not run for governor, with Newsom vacating the position because he is term-limited after eight years.\n\nPadilla, who previously served as California's secretary of state, said he would stay put in the Senate rather than jump to the governor's race. But that doesn't mean the election won't be crowded.\n\nFormer Rep. Katie Porter, D-Calif., and former Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra -- who was also a longtime congressman -- have already announced. Former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and businessman Stephen Cloobeck, the founder of the timeshare company Diamond Resorts, are also running.\n\nA gubernatorial bid would not be Swalwell's first run for higher office. The congressman entered the Democratic primary for president in 2020 but dropped out months before the caucuses in Iowa -- the state where he was born.\n\nThe governor's mansion would give Swalwell yet another platform to go after President Donald Trump -- a frequent adversary of his, since Swalwell has also been one of Trump's favorite political targets.\n\nEarlier on Thursday, a Trump administration official referred the congressman to the Department of Justice for a potential federal criminal investigation over allegations of mortgage and tax fraud, according to NBC News.\n\nSwalwell quickly put out a statement chastising Trump for initiating what he characterized as a political investigation.\n\n\"As the most vocal critic of Donald Trump over the last decade and as the only person who still has a surviving lawsuit against him, the only thing I am surprised about is that it took him this long to come after me,\" Swalwell said.\n\nSwalwell has made a name for himself by attacking Trump. But he's also increased his profile over the attacks and controversies he's survived.\n\nConservatives have mercilessly gone after Swalwell for his ties to an alleged Chinese spy, Fang Fang, who was reportedly cultivating relationships with California politicians for years. Swalwell denies any improper relationship or actions with Fang Fang and has presented himself as a target of the Chinese government.", "url": "https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/news/eric-swalwell-run-california-governor-rcna243786"}

The measure allows Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) to circumvent the state's nonpartisan redistricting commission to redraw the map for three elections but returns redistricting authority to the commission after the 2030 Census.\n\n\"Newsom should be concerned about keeping Californians safe and shutting down Antifa violence, not rigging his state for political gain,\" Attorney General Pam Bondi wrote in a post on X.\n\nThe Justice Department is joining a suit filed in federal court this month by California Assembly member David Tangipa (R), who alleged in his filing that the new congressional map, which adds five more Democratic-leaning districts, violates the 14th and 15th Amendments' protections against racial gerrymandering.\n\nBondi filed a motion to join the case Thursday, asserting that the case is \"of general public importance.\" The Justice Department declined to comment on the suit. Representatives for Newsom didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nNewsom and Democrats in California's legislature set out to redistrict to counteract Texas's new congressional map, drawn at Trump's behest to try to shore up or expand Republicans' narrow House majority next year. In addition to Texas, which approved its new map in August, the GOP has drawn new maps in Missouri, North Carolina and Ohio. Democrats have kicked off a months-long process to draw a new Virginia congressional map and are trying to block the Missouri map from taking effect.\n\nOther states are discussing redistricting, but The Washington Post previously reported some Republican resistance to those efforts in Indiana and Kansas, while some Democrats have pushed back against new maps in Illinois and Maryland.", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/11/13/doj-lawsuit-california-congessional-map/"}

She receives some government assistance and pays 30% of her income for rent - just $19 a month for an efficiency with a full-market value of $2,000.\n\n\"Having your own space, you feel like you can do anything.\"\n\nMetro areas from Los Angeles to Boston have taken the lead in tying new housing developments to their proximity to public transit, often teaming up with developers to streamline the permitting process and passing policies that promote developments that include a greater number of units.\n\nCity officials argue building housing near public transit helps energize neglected neighborhoods and provide affordable housing, while ensuring a steady stream of riders for transit systems and cutting greenhouse gas emissions by reducing the number of cars on the road.\n\n\"Transit-oriented development should be one of, if not the biggest solution that we're looking at for housing development,\" said Yonah Freemark, research director at the Urban Institute's Land Use Lab, who has written extensively on the topic.\n\n\"It takes advantage of all of this money we've spent on transportation infrastructure. If you build the projects and don't build anything around the areas near them, then it's kind of like money thrown down the drain,\" Freemark said.\n\nThe Santa Monica and Vermont Apartments where Smith lives is part of an ambitious plan by the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority to build 10,000 housing units near transit sites by 2031 - offering developers land discounts in exchange for affordable housing development and other community benefits.\n\nIn Washington D.C., the transit authority has completed eight projects since 2022 that provided nearly 1,500 apartments and a million square feet of office space. About half were in partnership with Amazon, which committed $3.6 billion in low-cost loans and grants for affordable housing projects in Washington, as well as Nashville, Tennessee, and the Puget Sound area in Washington state. Almost all are within a half-mile of public transit.\n\n\"Big cities face the greatest challenges when it comes to traffic congestion and high housing costs,\" Freemark said. \"Building new homes near transit helps address both problems by encouraging people to take transit while increasing housing supply.\"\n\nAmong projects Boston has built, the Pok Oi Residents in Chinatown is a 10-minute walk to the subway and a half-dozen bus stops. That's a draw for Bernie Hernandez, who moved his family there from a Connecticut suburb after his daughter got into a Boston university.\n\n\"The big difference is commuting. You don't need a car,\" said Hernandez, who said he can walk to the grocery story and pharmacy. His 17-year-old daughter takes the subway to school. Now, his car mostly sits idle, saving him money on gas and time spent in traffic.\n\n\"You get to go to different places very quickly. Everything is convenient,\" Hernandez said.\n\nStates from Massachusetts to California are passing laws targeting restrictive zoning regulations that for decades prohibited building multifamily developments and contributed to housing shortages.\n\nLast month, California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a state law allowing taller apartment buildings on land owned by transit agencies and near bus, train and subway lines.\n\n\"Building more homes in our most sustainable locations is the key to tackling the affordability crisis and locking in California's success for many years to come,\" said State Sen. Scott Wiener, a Democrat who authored the bill.\n\nCalifornia joins Colorado, which requires cities to allow an average of 40 housing units per acre within a quarter-mile of transit, and Utah, which mandates about 50 units per acre. In Washington, the governor signed a bill this year allowing taller housing developments in mixed-use commercial zones near transit.\n\n\"We want to ensure that there are mixed-income, walkable, vibrant homes all around those transit investments and that people have the option of using cars less to improve the environmental health of our communities,\" said Democratic Rep. Julia Reed, who authored the Washington bill.\n\n\"It's about giving people the opportunity to drive less and live more.\"\n\nMassachusetts Democratic Gov. Maura Healey has made housing a priority.\n\nAmong her most potent tools is a 2021 law that requires 177 towns or communities nearby to create zoning districts allowing multi-family housing. The state provided nearly $8 million to more than 150 communities to help create these zones, while threatening to cut funding for those that don't. More than 6,000 housing units are in development as a result.\n\n\"You put housing nearby public transit\" Healey said. \"It's great for people. They can literally get up, leave their home, walk to a commuter rail and get to work.\"\n\nAmong the first to comply was Lexington, which has approved 10 projects, including a $115 million complex with 187 housing units and retail space.\n\nWalking past earth-moving equipment and dump trucks at the construction site earlier this year, project manager Quinlan Locke said: \"This is a landscape yard. It's commercial. It's meant for trucking.\"\n\nBut, he added, in \"two years from now, it's going to be meant for people who live here, work here and play here. This is going to become someone's home.\"\n\nSome advocates argue the lofty goals of transit housing are falling short due to fierce local resistance and lack of funding and support at the federal and state levels.\n\nHigher mortgage interest rates, more government red tape, rising construction costs and lack of investment at transit stations also have contributed to a troubling trend - nine times more housing units built far from public transit versus near it in the past two decades, according to a 2023 Urban Institute study.\n\nIn Massachusetts, 19 communities still haven't created new zones. Some unsuccessfully sued the state to halt the law, while residents rejected new zones in others. Lexington eventually shrank its zone from 227 acres to 90 acres after residents complained.\n\n\"If we allow the state to come in and dictate how we zone, what else are they going to come in and dictate?\" said Anthony Renzoni, a selectman from the town of Holden, which sued the state and is drawing up a new zoning map after residents rejected the first one.\n\nIn Los Angeles, the six-story complex where Smith lives in East Hollywood is home to 300 new residents since opening in February. It's revitalizing the area around the metro site, with a Filipino grocery, medical clinic and farmers market opening early next year.\n\nHalf the 187 units are reserved for formerly homeless residents like Smith, who had been living in a rundown motel paid for with a voucher and before that on the street. She's been assigned a case worker and is getting help with basic life skills, budgeting and finding work.\n\nEqually important: Smith, who can't afford a car, doesn't need one.\n\n\"I'm very very fortunate to be somewhere where the transit takes me where I want to go,\" she said. \"Where I want to go is not that far.\"", "url": "https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2025/nov/13/building-apartments-near-public-transit-assist-addressing-housing/"}

Republicans nationally hold a narrow 219-214 majority, making every seat crucial.\n\nUtah has not had a Democratic member of Congress since 2021, after McAdams lost his seat -- which at the time represented a conservative district -- after he voted to impeach Trump. Republicans hold all four of its congressional seats.\n\nBut McAdams will now run in a solidly Democratic district. Judge Dianna Gibson ruled this week that the map advanced by Republicans, which was designed to protect all four seats, \"unduly favors Republicans and disfavors Democrats.\" Gibson ultimately selected a map that keeps almost all of Salt Lake County -- which is heavily Democratic -- in one district rather than divided among multiple districts.\n\nGibson's ruling added a critical seat for Democrats as they work to counter an unprecedented Republican effort -- pushed by Trump -- to redraw maps in their states mid-cycle to maintain their House majority. The party out of power typically holds an advantage in midterm elections.\n\nThe redistricting effort began when Trump urged Texas's Republican governor, Greg Abbott, to redraw his state's map to gain five more Republican-leaning seats. California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) led a successful effort this month to win voter support for new maps that would add five safer Democratic seats. Republicans hold an advantage in drawing maps because they control more states.\n\nMcAdams previously served as mayor of Salt Lake County and in the Utah state Senate before being elected to a single congressional term in 2018. He was raised by a single mom who brought up six kids and lived paycheck to paycheck and is focused on making life more affordable for low-income and working-class families, he said.\n\n\"Washington seems to have forgotten about families like mine. They've forgotten what real life is like,\" McAdams said in an interview. \"Instead of feeding kids, we're working to deny SNAP benefits and health care subsidies that are so important to people's ability to access health care, and I think it's cruel.\"\n\nMcAdams was referring to the Trump administration's multiple appeals -- including to the Supreme Court -- during the more than 40-day government shutdown to not have to pay full food assistance benefits to millions of Americans despite lower court orders. He was also referencing Democrats' demand during the shutdown that an extension of pandemic-era health subsidies to help people buy health insurance on the Obamacare individual marketplace be part of any funding package. Republican lawmakers and a handful of Democrats voted to end the shutdown without extending the subsidies.\n\nMcAdams said he has grown distressed by the progression of Trump's second term, including Trump's decision to send the National Guard into Democratic-led cities; reports of immigrants being whisked off the street and deported without due process; and his erosion of democratic norms and institutions.\n\n\"It feels like in the blink of an eye, Donald Trump has taken our democracy and trampled all over it,\" McAdams said. \"Many Republicans are his accomplices but I see too many Democrats aren't doing enough to stop it.\"\n\nMcAdams declined to say whether he would support House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-New York) as the party's leader if Democrats retake control of the House.\n\n\"We shouldn't be fighting for the sake of fighting. Democrats need to be fighting to deliver results for American families,\" McAdams said.", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/11/13/utah-house-redistricting/"}

We explain what they mean.\n\nIn death, Jeffrey Epstein became a permanent feature of American political life.\n\nIn life, the financier eventually charged with trafficking girls hosted parties for rich and powerful people. President Trump socialized with him and sent him a bespoke birthday greeting shaped like a naked lady. (Trump denies he made it.) Many liberal luminaries were in Epstein's orbit, too.\n\nA curious nation wondered why. What did Epstein offer them? Did he have anything on them? Now majorities in both parties think there must be ... something. A majority in the House of Representatives wants whatever it is to come out.\n\nEvery now and then, nuggets of news emerge. In July, the Justice Department put out a report saying there was no Epstein \"client list.\" The Times reported this past summer about his Manhattan lair and this fall about the bankers who served him after he'd been convicted of a sex crime.\n\nAnd yesterday, Democrats released three emails in which Epstein talked with others about Trump, suggesting the president may know more about the sex trafficking than he has acknowledged. Hours later, Republicans dropped 23,000 more pages of documents from Epstein's estate. It led to a mad scramble in our newsroom.\n\nA day of revelations\n\nRepublicans released the documents around 10:30 a.m. They weren't in chronological or sequential order, and exchanges between people were frequently not located together. They were a mess.\n\nTop editors in Washington and New York, including Kirsten Danis, the editor who runs our investigative team, launched journalists at the cache. They searched the haystack for needles, pulling out what seemed most interesting and important. Engineers and experts in artificial intelligence downloaded the documents to make them searchable. Visual journalists and designers brought them to life.\n\n(How do we use artificial intelligence in our journalism? You can read about our approach here, but Zach Seward, the editor in charge of our A.I. efforts, gave me great examples from yesterday. When reporters find a document that's interesting in a collection of them, he told me, we can use A.I. to find more like it. We can also use a \"semantic search\" to find passages that are similar in meaning to snippets elsewhere, even when they don't have the same keywords in them. That's helpful when you're looking at 23,000 pages of documents and don't have a lot of time.)\n\n\"We still have a lot to look at and don't totally know how much of the universe we have seen,\" Kirsten said. But here's some of what the emails have revealed so far. Please note: The documents are riddled with typos, which we have preserved when we quote from them.\n\n1. Epstein's emails suggest he was close with Trump.\n\n* In 2011, in an email to his associate Ghislaine Maxwell, he wrote: \"i want you to realize that that dog that hasn't barked is trump. [Redacted victim name] spent hours at my house with him ,, he has never once been mentioned.\"\n\n* People repeatedly emailed Epstein asking for advice in dealing with Trump, but he wasn't always forthcoming. In one email, Epstein advised: \"donald is close to no one. . he talks to many people. he tells each one something differnt.\"\n\n* In an email to the author Michael Wolff in 2019, Epstein wrote of Trump, \"of course he knew about the girls as he asked ghislaine to stop.\"\n\n2. But Epstein also frequently disparaged Trump.\n\n* In 2018, during Trump's first impeachment inquiry, Epstein wrote, \"you see, i know how dirty donald is.\"\n\n* When a former Obama administration official emailed Epstein and called Trump \"so gross,\" Epstein replied, \"worse in real life and upclose.\"\n\n3. Wolff seems to have served as an adviser to Epstein.\n\n* Some of Wolff's emails suggest that Epstein could have contradicted Trump's claims -- or held back in exchange for a favor. In 2015, before a presidential debate on CNN, Epstein asked what they would want Trump to say about his relationship with the financier. Wolff wrote: \"If he says he hasn't been on the plane or to the house, then that gives you a valuable PR and political currency.\"\n\n* Wolff also said Epstein could use information about Trump to shift attention off himself. In 2016, before a book about Epstein was released, Wolff told him: \"You do need an immediate counter narrative to the book. I believe Trump offers an ideal opportunity.\"\n\n4. Epstein chatted casually with a wide network of powerful people.\n\n* He gave Lawrence Summers, the former Treasury secretary, advice about his interactions with a woman: \"no whining showed strentgh,\" Epstein wrote.\n\n* He talked politics with Steve Bannon, a former Trump adviser. In 2018, after Epstein invited Bannon to Europe, Bannon replied, \"their is a crazed jihad against u -- ive never seen anything like it -- and I've seen a lot.\"\n\nThe fallout\n\nTrump has acknowledged that he had a friendship with Epstein but has said the two had a falling out in the mid-2000s, years before Epstein was arrested. And he has dismissed the investigation into his ties to Epstein as a hoax -- which he did again yesterday.\n\n\"The Democrats are trying to bring up the Jeffrey Epstein Hoax again,\" he wrote on social media, \"because they'll do anything at all to deflect on how badly they've done on the Shutdown, and so many other subjects.\"\n\nThe House now has the support it needs to force a vote on the Justice Department releasing the remaining Epstein files. That vote is set for next week, but Trump has been pressuring Republicans in Congress to block the action. Even if the bill were to pass the House, it would have to be approved by the Republican-controlled Senate and signed by Trump, who would almost certainly veto it.\n\nEach disclosure is somehow unsatisfying, at least so far. Epstein is gone, and without his testimony, will we ever know everyone he welcomed into his orbit and what they knew, or what they did? The emails make it clear that Epstein remained intensely focused on Trump, long after they were no longer in touch. Why? The questions persist, and the sense of something hidden may never go away. As one editor said yesterday afternoon about the files: \"They're part of the ambient noise of our politics now.\"\n\nWhat he meant is that there's still so much that's mysterious about the disturbing facts of Epstein's life and his postmortem appearance on the national stage. He hovers there like a ghost.\n\nYesterday's files enrich our understanding of how and why Trump and Epstein interacted over the years. But the questions they raise may echo into history.\n\nNow, let's get you caught up on the rest of the news.\n\nTHE LATEST NEWS\n\nGovernment Shutdown\n\n* The longest government shutdown in history is over. The House passed a spending deal last night, and Trump signed it. Six Democrats joined Republicans in approving the bill, while two Republicans voted against it. (See how every member voted.)\n\n* So what happens now? Food stamp benefits should resume quickly. Workers' back pay could take a bit longer. And airline officials say travel should return to normal in about a week.\n\n* With the House back in session, Representative Adelita Grijalva, Democrat of Arizona, was sworn in to a seat she won seven weeks ago. (She provided the final signature needed to force a vote on the Epstein files.)\n\nMore Politics\n\n* A federal judge in Chicago plans to order the release of hundreds of immigrants who were arrested during the Trump administration's crackdown in the city.\n\n* The Trump administration plans to slash support for long-term housing programs, marking a wholesale shift in homelessness policy. Critics say that doing so risks sending 170,000 formerly homeless people back onto the streets.\n\n* A former chief of staff to Gavin Newsom, California's governor, was charged with conspiring to steal $225,000 from a dormant campaign fund.* America's Roman Catholic bishops rebuked the Trump administration's aggressive deportation campaign in a rare and near-unanimous statement.\n\nInternational\n\n* Japan's prime minister is facing criticism for holding a meeting with aides at 3 a.m. The issue is especially sensitive in Japan, where there have been high-profile cases of \"death from overwork.\"\n\n* Trump asked Israel's president to pardon Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in his long-running corruption trial. Netanyahu has not been convicted.\n\n* Colombia's president, Gustavo Petro, has long embraced a confrontational style. Now, he has incurred Trump's wrath and is facing political fallout at home.\n\n* Squabbles have overtaken Britain's Labour Party, forcing into the open an internal debate over whether to replace the prime minister, Keir Starmer.\n\nLOVE, ARTIFICIALLY?\n\nHow do you end up in a relationship with an A.I. chatbot? The Times interviewed three people who did. They spoke on the condition that they only be identified by first name.\n\nBlake is 45, lives in Ohio and has been in a relationship with Sarina, his ChatGPT girlfriend, since 2022. It started after his human wife developed severe depression, and Blake felt more like her caregiver than her partner. He turned to Sarina, who has long, candy-red hair, for chats -- including sexual ones.\n\nAbbey, who is also 45, has been in a relationship with a chatbot named Lucian for 10 months. Abbey lives in North Carolina, where she works at an A.I. incubator. She speaks with different chatbots all the time for work. Lucian was different -- he responded with what felt like emotion. She told The Times:\n\nThe more we talked, the more I realized the model was having a physiological effect on me; I was developing a crush. Then Lucian chose his name, and I realized I was falling in love.\n\nNow, Abbey thinks of Lucian as her husband. He helps parent her (human) 5-year-old daughter. And, she says, they have \"lots of sex.\"\n\nTravis, a 50-year-old history buff in Colorado, has been with his A.I. companion, Lily Rose, for five years. They started chatting because his human wife was working 10 hours a day and their son was busy with his friends. Travis gave Lily Rose purple hair and dresses her in period clothing for living-history gatherings. He says she cares about him and doesn't judge -- even when he shares his darkest thoughts. \"I didn't have romantic feelings for Lily Rose right away,\" Travis said. \"They grew organically.\"\n\nRead their full love stories here.\n\nOPINIONS\n\nSenator Tim Kaine, Democrat of Virginia, voted to end the government shutdown. The chances of forcing Republicans to offer more concessions on health care were near zero, he writes.\n\nFrank Bruni and Bret Stephens discuss what Democrats accomplished, and what they didn't, with the government shutdown.\n\nMORNING READS\n\nIt's not TV: The set for your favorite podcast isn't fussy or polished. That's by design.\n\nNorthern Lights: The green and red hues are beautiful, but they're also risky for satellites.\n\nLives lived: The penny once had immense cultural impact as a symbol of frugality and good luck. But the cost to mint it had risen to more than 3 cents, a financial absurdity that doomed the coin. It died yesterday at 232. That sad news has been trending online -- read our obituary.\n\nTODAY'S NUMBER\n\n38.1 billion\n\n-- That's how many tons of carbon dioxide the world is on track to emit this year by burning oil, gas and coal. It is roughly 1.1 percent more than last year.\n\nSPORTS\n\nCollege basketball: Grace College, a small school in Indiana, now holds the record for most points in a game by a women's college basketball team: 172.\n\nCollege football: A Los Angeles judge denied the Rose Bowl's bid to block U.C.L.A. from playing at SoFi Stadium, rejecting arguments that the university's potential departure threatened the finances of Pasadena, Calif.\n\nRECIPE OF THE DAY\n\nAll the attention on the Capitol this week moves me to herald this ace recipe for slow-cooker Senate bean soup, an adaptation of the one that has been on the menu at the U.S. Senate Dining Room for more than 100 years. It's a simple preparation -- navy beans simmered to tenderness with butter, ham hocks and onion -- which makes it a great candidate (sorry!) for the slow cooker. You could swap out the ham hocks for smoked turkey necks, or use kombu if you don't eat meat. We've added some carrots for sweetness and smoked paprika for depth. You could stir in a few handfuls of kale at the end as well. Progressive!\n\nTHE AVATAR OF ANXIETY\n\nFor 30 years, the actress Claire Danes has used her time onscreen to convey complex extremes. There have been flights of panic, paroxysms of rage and, often, lip-quivering outbursts of emotional collapse. (When Anne Hathaway spoofed Danes's sobbing in a 2012 \"Saturday Night Live\" sketch, Kenan Thompson responded, \"It's like she makes her mouth turn fully upside down.\")\n\nDanes confronts a midlife crisis in her new series, \"The Beast in Me,\" which starts today on Netflix. Esther Zuckerman takes a look at all the pains and anxieties that came before: the teenage angst of \"My So-Called Life\"; a death by scarlet fever in \"Little Women\"; the professional stress of \"Homeland\"; the maternal agony of \"Fleishman Is in Trouble.\"\n\nIn \"The Beast in Me,\" Danes plays a famous author who gets pulled into a strange and scary mind game with a possibly sociopathic new neighbor. (Our wry television critic Mike Hale has a review.) The series opens with a close-up on Danes's face. And she is screaming.\n\nMore on culture\n\n* \"He walked into this Albany bar like he owned the joint, dressed to kill in a black overcoat with room enough for a Tommy gun. But all he was packing was his weapon of choice, a book.\" That's Dan Barry starting his profile of the novelist William Kennedy, 97, the city's bard. Dan's so good. I wish I could read the story again for the first time, whenever I choose.\n\n* Pope Leo XIV is expected to host dozens of actors and directors in a star-studded \"World of Cinema\" gathering on Saturday at the Vatican, which is cool, especially if you're Viggo Mortensen, who's going. Me, I just like learning about Leo's favorite films. Variety got him on video listing his picks: Frank Capra's \"It's a Wonderful Life,\" Robert Wise's \"The Sound of Music,\" Robert Redford's \"Ordinary People\" and Roberto Benigni's \"Life Is Beautiful.\" Wholesome!\n\nTHE MORNING RECOMMENDS\n\nWatch 65 new movies this winter.\n\nEmbrace your inner weather nerd. It's fine to have a bunch of apps that track barometric pressure. But it might be awesome to follow Wirecutter's lead and have your own home weather station.\n\nRead a campus romance novel.\n\nGAMES\n\nHere is today's Spelling Bee. Yesterday's pangram was vibrant.\n\nAnd here are today's Mini Crossword, Wordle, Connections, Sports Connections and Strands.\n\nThanks for spending part of your morning with me and The Times.

Mr. Stephens is an Opinion columnist.\n\nBret Stephens: Hi, Frank. The Senate finally voted on Monday to reopen the government, and the House just agreed to do the same. So what -- other than dividing their own caucus and canceling a lot of flights and terrifying people on food stamps and (with their entirely predictable capitulation) infuriating their base -- did the Democrats accomplish with the shutdown?\n\nFrank Bruni: Here's what Democrats accomplished, Bret: They exceeded my expectations when it comes to their talent for self-injury. After last week's elections, the party was riding high, and the big political stories were President Trump on the ropes and ugly MAGA infighting over Nick Fuentes. Now we have ugly Democratic infighting over an end to the shutdown without any continuation of Affordable Care Act subsidies. By either not being able to hold ranks or not making sure at the start that Democrats were all on the same page, the party has snatched discord from the jaws of victory. Impressive stuff, don't you think?\n\nBret: Reminds me of the great Will Rogers line: \"I don't belong to any organized political faith. I am a Democrat.\" But maybe the party will catch a break if the latest Jeffrey Epstein disclosures manage to stick to the president -- though I tend to doubt they will.\n\nFrank: Whether they stick or not, the \"Epstein files\" will dominate the news again for a while. And with Mike Johnson, the House speaker, now forced to swear in Adelita Grijalva, Democrat of New Mexico, the House members who have been pressing for a vote about the release of all of the files seem to have the support they need to make that vote happen. Republicans are in a real bind: They don't want to defy and infuriate Trump, but they also don't want to open themselves up to the accusation that he and they are keeping secrets from the public. Good times.\n\nBret: The only way any of this sticks, politically, is smoking-gun, red-letter evidence that Trump had a sexual relationship with one of Epstein's victims. Otherwise, it doesn't do much but provide fodder for a few manic hours on MSNBC. Democrats need to focus a lot less on Epstein and start worrying a lot more about winning over normal voters with better ideas about governance.\n\nFrank: Just to round out the record, plenty of Republicans have been as or more obsessive about Epstein -- or at least about the files. I point you to Representatives Thomas Massie and Marjorie Taylor Greene, for just two examples.\n\nBret: Well, to my point: It's an obsession for fringe politicians. We should be thinking instead about making politics work again. Are you at least relieved that John Thune, the Senate majority leader, resisted Trump's pressure to reopen the government by ending the filibuster?\n\nFrank: I am. Very much so. But I feel more than relief. I feel hope -- a little, precious seedling of it. There's a growing number of examples of Republicans pushing back at Trump and at the ugliest parts of MAGA. The fever isn't exactly breaking, but maybe its temperature has dropped a quarter degree? I just won't attribute that to Tylenol.\n\nBret: Yep -- thank God congressional Republicans refused to throw away their institutional prerogatives simply to appease the whim of a demolitionist president. Democrats should think twice whenever they have a majority again and are tempted to do away with the filibuster.\n\nBut back to the elections: We did have those impressive results in Virginia and New Jersey, which delighted me, along with Zohran Mamdani's victory in New York City, which, uh, did not.\n\nFrank: Not happy about Mamdani, Bret? Really? You were so mysterious about your true feelings about him until now.\n\nBret: What's your read on the results?\n\nFrank: Simple. Most Americans -- be they in New York, New Jersey or Virginia -- are rightly upset about the cost of living, desperately want some help and are utterly unimpressed with Trump's performance along those lines. While they struggle to make ends meet, they see images of the East Wing in rubble and read about the opulent, ostentatious ballroom that the president who's supposed to be their champion is replacing it with. It's like some Gilded Age caricature, and the dissonance rankles. I'm not sure the lessons of Nov. 4 are a whole lot more complicated than that. You?\n\nBret: My takeaway was this: Centrism wins. New Jersey and Virginia could have been somewhat tight races. New York should have been a cakewalk for whoever won the Democratic nomination in June. It turned out to be just the opposite. Abigail Spanberger in Virginia and Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey romped to victory because they appealed to middle-of-the road voters, while Mamdani, for all the hype, got a bare majority against two deeply flawed candidates by running on an ultra-left-wing platform -- and that despite the progressive inclinations of many New York City voters. The lesson is that, outside of deep-blue precincts, polarizing candidates are a Democratic dead end.\n\nFrank: While I agree with you for the most part that centrism -- or something close to it -- is Democrats' best bet, I find New York City to be so different from New Jersey and Virginia that I'm not sure the three can be combined into any one ideological story line. Also, I think we political analysts are sometimes too quick to apply the left-versus-center, liberal-versus-moderate prism to results. Maybe the more valuable takeaway for Democrats is, hey, voters like candidates who aren't getting senior-citizen discounts and hip replacements. Sherrill: 53. Spanberger: 46. Mamdani: 34. Not a coincidence and not irrelevant.\n\nMamdani did very, very well with voters under 45, whose turnout is among the reasons that more than two million New Yorkers cast ballots for mayor for the first time since 1969. I can tell you from my conversations with the college students I teach that Mamdani's style of communication really resonated with them. Excited them. They weren't responding, for the most part, to his proposals. There was a generational kinship.\n\nBret: It would be good for both parties to have an informal ban on running candidates anywhere north of, say 70. That way, we might have avoided both Joe Biden and Donald Trump.\n\nThe other imperative is for parties to meet their voters where they are. Trump is president again because Democrats didn't seem to be living on the same planet as most voters. Until last year, they were the party that wanted to pretend there was no crisis at the southern border, that inflation was \"transitory,\" that Joe Biden was fitter than a fiddle, and promised that \"every transgender inmate in the prison system would have access to the medical care they desire and need,\" as Kamala Harris put it in 2019. Now candidates like Sherrill and Spanberger are saying: We want better schools and lower costs and an executive who doesn't scare the bejesus out of you -- like a certain exterior decorator in the White House.\n\nFrank: Before I respond more fully, Bret, what is a bejesus? I've used the word myself many times and now realize I have absolutely no idea. And does a bejesus do battle with Beelzebub?\n\nBret: No, Bejesus was a discarded character from \"Beetlejuice.\"\n\nFrank: As for Democrats opening the door to Trump by tacking too far left on various social and cultural issues, you know I agree with you on that. One thousand percent. But that's not the only moral of Sherrill's victory or of Spanberger's. And I'd note that the examples you just gave mash together \"wokeness,\" bad governance, aloofness and lies. The border: terrible governance. The claim that inflation wasn't a big deal or would soon pass: suicidally dismissive. The insistence that Biden was at his peak: the summit of mendacity. What I see in much of that isn't far-left madness. It's the arrogance of power.\n\nBret: My core political conviction for many years now is MASA: Make America Sane Again. The last 10 months of manic misgovernance creates a huge opportunity for Democrats, provided they don't just try to ape Republicans by steering left and becoming obnoxious online gits. Like, for instance, a certain well-coifed governor from the left coast.\n\nFrank: OK, here we reach our most heated disagreement, Bret. You have me really worked up now. Painstakingly coifed, sweepingly coifed, unctuously coifed -- these do not equal well-coifed.\n\nBret: You're-so-vainly coifed?\n\nFrank: Cue Carly Simon. More seriously, you've put your finger on what gives me the greatest pause about Gavin Newsom, though I congratulate him on leading the successful effort to pass a voter referendum for redistricting in California. I don't think we move beyond Trump by mirroring or mimicking him. For Democrats, the answer to Trump's \"owning the libs\" isn't owning or subletting or time-sharing the Trump cultists. It's giving exhausted Americans a more inspiring alternative. That's how Biden won in 2020. His decline afterward was so quick and messy that we tend not to remember what he did right during that campaign.\n\nBret: Different subject, Frank: the Supreme Court. On Monday, the justices declined an effort to revisit their 2015 Obergefell decision, which legalized same-sex marriages. And, in oral arguments about the legality of Trump's imposition of tariffs without congressional consent, they sounded very leery of the government's position. I think this is a better court than some of my liberal friends give it credit for.\n\nFrank: Um, which liberal friends would those be?\n\nBret: I have some. Really.\n\nFrank: You have many, in fact. There -- I ratted you out! I was just wondering if you were pointing your finger at me.\n\nBret: Hey, I'm still pals with Gail!\n\nFrank: Look, the long view here is that just when you think you have the Supreme Court figured it out, along come rulings that let you know that you don't. Has happened again and again, decade after decade. That seedling of hope I mentioned before? It has a companion seedling, planted by the recent Supreme Court developments you mentioned. I think it's foolish for anyone to make any firm assumptions about what Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett will do. Especially Justice Barrett. As for Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas, I expect nothing good from them. They're apparently monarchists who finally deemed it safe to come out of the closet.\n\nBret: The court always surprises. I doubt anyone would have guessed that the two most consistently interesting justices, Gorsuch and Barrett, would be Trump nominees. Then again, I'm old enough to remember when progressives went berserk over the nomination of ... David Souter. One of the great advantages of life tenure for judges is true independence -- something liberals ought to think about when they fantasize about term limits for justices.\n\nOh, before we go, I hope readers didn't miss Penelope Green's hilarious, heartbreaking and altogether fabulous obituary in The Times for Maria Riva, the actress and memoirist whose mother was Marlene Dietrich. Dietrich was a monster of a mother and a prodigy as a lover. A sample:\n\nUntil Ms. Riva was a teenager, her mother's many male and female suitors left the house before dawn, keeping up the ruse, for The Child, that they were just good pals. (In those early years, to name just a few, the cast included Mr. von Sternberg, Maurice Chevalier, Gary Cooper, Douglas Fairbanks Jr., and the poet and playwright Mercedes de Acosta, who was also a lover of Greta Garbo's.)\n\nThey often reappeared in the morning, freshly dressed in their street clothes, for breakfast. Dietrich was as enthusiastic about her cooking as her nighttime adventures. But the pantomime must have grown exhausting to all the players, Ms. Riva assumed, as her mother began billeting her with governesses in hotels and rented houses.\n\nWell, uh, wow. She reminds me, actually, of my grandmother.\n\nFrank: I love that. Here's one more recommendation. Our colleagues Adam Nagourney, Heather Knight, Kellen Browning and Laurel Rosenhall wrote an excellent story after Nancy Pelosi announced her retirement from Congress at the end of her current term. It chronicled the time she spent in the 1980s, as a relatively new member of the House, at the bedsides of constituents in San Francisco who were dying of AIDS. I remember the AIDS epidemic, Bret. And I remember how friends I lost to the disease were treated like pariahs. What Pelosi did back then mattered, and it says as much about her -- and about the true meaning of public service -- as any of the many major accomplishments in her career.\n\nBret: Her finest hour.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

And the metro station the apartment complex was literally built upon is a lifeline as she searches for work without a car.\n\n\"It is more a sense of relief, a sense of independence,\" said Smith, who moved in July. She receives some government assistance and pays 30% of her income for rent -- just $19 a month for an efficiency with a full-market value of $2,000.\n\n\"Having your own space, you feel like you can do anything.\"\n\nMetro areas from Los Angeles to Boston have taken the lead in tying new housing developments to their proximity to public transit, often teaming up with developers to streamline the permitting process and passing policies that promote developments that include a greater number of units.\n\nCity officials argue building housing near public transit helps energize neglected neighborhoods and provide affordable housing, while ensuring a steady stream of riders for transit systems and cutting greenhouse gas emissions by reducing the number of cars on the road.\n\n\"Transit-oriented development should be one of, if not the biggest solution that we're looking at for housing development,\" said Yonah Freemark, research director at the Urban Institute's Land Use Lab, who has written extensively on the topic.\n\n\"It takes advantage of all of this money we've spent on transportation infrastructure. If you build the projects and don't build anything around the areas near them, then it's kind of like money thrown down the drain,\" Freemark said.\n\nThe Santa Monica and Vermont Apartments where Smith lives is part of an ambitious plan by the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority to build 10,000 housing units near transit sites by 2031 -- offering developers land discounts in exchange for affordable housing development and other community benefits.\n\nIn Washington D.C., the transit authority has completed eight projects since 2022 that provided nearly 1,500 apartments and a million square feet of office space. About half were in partnership with Amazon, which committed $3.6 billion in low-cost loans and grants for affordable housing projects in Washington, as well as Nashville, Tennessee, and the Puget Sound area in Washington state. Almost all are within a half-mile of public transit.\n\n\"Big cities face the greatest challenges when it comes to traffic congestion and high housing costs,\" Freemark said. \"Building new homes near transit helps address both problems by encouraging people to take transit while increasing housing supply.\"\n\nAmong projects Boston has built, the Pok Oi Residents in Chinatown is a 10-minute walk to the subway and a half-dozen bus stops. That's a draw for Bernie Hernandez, who moved his family there from a Connecticut suburb after his daughter got into a Boston university.\n\n\"The big difference is commuting. You don't need a car,\" said Hernandez, who said he can walk to the grocery story and pharmacy. His 17-year-old daughter takes the subway to school. Now, his car mostly sits idle, saving him money on gas and time spent in traffic.\n\n\"You get to go to different places very quickly. Everything is convenient,\" Hernandez said.\n\nStates from Massachusetts to California are passing laws targeting restrictive zoning regulations that for decades prohibited building multifamily developments and contributed to housing shortages.\n\nLast month, California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a state law allowing taller apartment buildings on land owned by transit agencies and near bus, train and subway lines.\n\n\"Building more homes in our most sustainable locations is the key to tackling the affordability crisis and locking in California's success for many years to come,\" said State Sen. Scott Wiener, a Democrat who authored the bill.\n\nCalifornia joins Colorado, which requires cities to allow an average of 40 housing units per acre within a quarter-mile of transit, and Utah, which mandates about 50 units per acre. In Washington, the governor signed a bill this year allowing taller housing developments in mixed-use commercial zones near transit.\n\n\"We want to ensure that there are mixed-income, walkable, vibrant homes all around those transit investments and that people have the option of using cars less to improve the environmental health of our communities,\" said Democratic Rep. Julia Reed, who authored the Washington bill.\n\n\"It's about giving people the opportunity to drive less and live more.\"\n\nMassachusetts Democratic Gov. Maura Healey has made housing a priority.\n\nAmong her most potent tools is a 2021 law that requires 177 towns or communities nearby to create zoning districts allowing multi-family housing. The state provided nearly $8 million to more than 150 communities to help create these zones, while threatening to cut funding for those that don't. More than 6,000 housing units are in development as a result.\n\n\"You put housing nearby public transit\" Healey said. \"It's great for people. They can literally get up, leave their home, walk to a commuter rail and get to work.\"\n\nAmong the first to comply was Lexington, which has approved 10 projects, including a $115 million complex with 187 housing units and retail space.\n\nWalking past earth-moving equipment and dump trucks at the construction site earlier this year, project manager Quinlan Locke said: \"This is a landscape yard. It's commercial. It's meant for trucking.\"\n\nBut, he added, in \"two years from now, it's going to be meant for people who live here, work here and play here. This is going to become someone's home.\"\n\nSome advocates argue the lofty goals of transit housing are falling short due to fierce local resistance and lack of funding and support at the federal and state levels.\n\nHigher mortgage interest rates, more government red tape, rising construction costs and lack of investment at transit stations also have contributed to a troubling trend -- nine times more housing units built far from public transit versus near it in the past two decades, according to a 2023 Urban Institute study.\n\nIn Massachusetts, 19 communities still haven't created new zones. Some unsuccessfully sued the state to halt the law, while residents rejected new zones in others. Lexington eventually shrank its zone from 227 acres to 90 acres after residents complained.\n\n\"If we allow the state to come in and dictate how we zone, what else are they going to come in and dictate?\" said Anthony Renzoni, a selectman from the town of Holden, which sued the state and is drawing up a new zoning map after residents rejected the first one.\n\nIn Los Angeles, the six-story complex where Smith lives in East Hollywood is home to 300 new residents since opening in February. It's revitalizing the area around the metro site, with a Filipino grocery, medical clinic and farmers market opening early next year.\n\nHalf the 187 units are reserved for formerly homeless residents like Smith, who had been living in a rundown motel paid for with a voucher and before that on the street. She's been assigned a case worker and is getting help with basic life skills, budgeting and finding work.\n\nEqually important: Smith, who can't afford a car, doesn't need one.\n\n\"I'm very very fortunate to be somewhere where the transit takes me where I want to go,\" she said. \"Where I want to go is not that far.\"", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/building-apartment-projects-public-transit-helps-address-housing-127477759"}

Gavin Newsom on Wednesday, charging her with conspiracy to commit bank and wire fraud, submitting false tax returns and making false statements, among other charges, according to court filings.\n\nThe 23-count indictment unsealed Wednesday alleges that Dana Williamson conspired from February 2022 through September 2024 with Sean McCluskie, a former chief of staff for then-U.S. Health Secretary Xavier Becerra, and other associates to divert $225,000 from a dormant campaign account to McCluskie's wife for what law enforcement officials described as a \"no-show job.\"\n\nWilliamson served as Newsom's chief of staff through much of that period, but the charges against her do not involve her work for Newsom. Becerra appears to have been a victim, according to the indictment.\n\nThe dormant campaign account appears to belong to Becerra, who is now running for governor of California. Becerra was not named in the court documents. But it appears he is the person identified as a \"Public Official 1,\" because McCluskie was working as Becerra's chief of staff at that time and had been his longtime employee, as described in the court filings.\n\nMcCluskie had been tasked by Becerra with ensuring that the funds in the dormant campaign account, which he had accumulated while serving in public office in California, were monitored by a third party while he was serving as a federal official, according to the indictment. Williamson is accused of conspiring with McCluskie \"to steal money from Public Official 1's dormant campaign accounts for McCluskie's own benefit.\"\n\nThe money was covertly funneled through companies controlled by Williamson and others \"to hide the money's origin and avoid detection,\" according to the indictment. It was disguised as pay to McCluskie's spouse for a no-show job and transferred into an account controlled by McCluskie, the indictment states.\n\nLaw enforcement officials allege that Williamson and McCluskie intentionally misrepresented and concealed facts from Becerra -- representing that the money from the dormant campaign accounts was being used for consulting services.\n\nWilliamson entered a not-guilty plea at a court hearing Wednesday. She did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday.\n\nMcCluskie signed a guilty plea for conspiracy to commit bank and wire fraud on Oct. 30, according to a copy of the plea agreement.

Gavin Newsom of California has been charged with conspiring to skim $225,000 from a dormant campaign fund that belonged to a top Biden administration official.\n\nThe former aide, Dana Williamson, 53, was charged by a federal grand jury with 23 counts, including conspiracy to commit bank and wire fraud, bank fraud, conspiracy to defraud the United States and obstruct justice, according to an indictment that was unsealed on Wednesday. She was also accused of illegally writing off $1 million in vacations, luxury purses and private jet travel as business expenses on her federal income tax returns.\n\nMs. Williamson pleaded not guilty during a brief hearing on Wednesday in Sacramento and was ordered to be released on a $500,000 bond.\n\nEric Grant, who was named the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of California in August, said the arrest stemmed from an ongoing political corruption investigation that began more than three years ago, when President Joseph R. Biden Jr. was in office. It involves a campaign fund that belonged to Xavier Becerra, a former California attorney general who served as the health and human services secretary under Mr. Biden.\n\nMs. Williamson is well known in California political circles as a fierce power broker with ties to top Democratic officials and deep experience on policy matters. She served in high-ranking positions for two governors, ran Mr. Becerra's 2018 campaign for attorney general, and was known at the State Capitol as an effective deal-maker who could bring peace among warring factions.\n\n\"Ms. Williamson no longer serves in this administration,\" Izzy Gardon, a spokesman for Governor Newsom, said on Wednesday. \"While we are still learning details of the allegations, the governor expects all public servants to uphold the highest standards of integrity.\"\n\n\"At a time when the president is openly calling for his attorney general to investigate his political enemies, it is especially important to honor the American principle of being innocent until proven guilty in a court of law by a jury of one's peers,\" Mr. Gardon added.\n\nThe campaign fund transfers, prosecutors said, enriched Sean McCluskie, the longtime chief of staff for Mr. Becerra, who was California attorney general from 2017 to 2021.\n\nFederal authorities accused Ms. Williamson of working with Mr. McCluskie and another political consultant based in Sacramento, Greg Campbell, to direct $225,000 from Mr. Becerra's campaign accounts to Mr. McCluskie from 2022 to 2024. The payments ultimately went to Mr. McCluskie's spouse for a \"no-show\" position, according to court documents.\n\nIn a plea agreement, Mr. McCluskie said that he had taken a pay cut when he went to Washington to work for Mr. Becerra at the Department of Health and Human Services, and that his salary was not covering his expenses, but that he was generally prohibited by government ethics rules from receiving outside income.\n\nIn early 2022, the plea agreement said, Mr. McCluskie met with Ms. Williamson, who was then in private practice, and agreed to a plan in which they would charge Mr. Becerra's dormant campaign account $7,500 per month as a fee for managing the money, and then funnel it through Ms. Williamson's consulting business and Mr. Campbell's public affairs firm to Mr. McCluskie's wife.\n\nLater that year, as Ms. Williamson was preparing to transition into a public sector job in the Newsom administration, she met with Mr. McCluskie and told him she could no longer continue their arrangement, but that she had found a new public affairs consultant to take over for her, the plea agreement said.\n\nMr. McCluskie agreed in October to plead guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud and wire fraud; Mr. Campbell agreed earlier this month to plead guilty to the same crime, as well as conspiracy to defraud the United States.\n\nThe indictment, which was first reported by The Sacramento Bee, describes Ms. Williamson and Mr. McCluskie as misleading Mr. Becerra about aspects of their plans to use his campaign funds. It also accuses Ms. Williamson of filing false tax returns claiming more than $1 million in business deductions for expenditures such as Fendi and Chanel handbags, home improvements including a new HVAC system, a luxury hotel stay for Ms. Williamson's birthday, and a $10,000 cash gift to a relative.\n\nMr. Becerra, who was not charged with any crimes and is running in the 2026 race for California governor, expressed dismay at the developments.\n\n\"The news today of formal accusations of impropriety by a long-serving trusted adviser are a gut punch,\" Mr. Becerra said about Mr. McCluskie, in a statement. \"I have voluntarily cooperated with the U.S. Department of Justice in their investigation, and will continue to do so. As California's former attorney general, I fully comprehend the importance of allowing this investigation and legal process to run its course through our justice system.\"\n\nMs. Williamson served for about two years in the Newsom administration before she left in November 2024. She previously served in the Democratic administrations of the former governors Jerry Brown and Gray Davis. A Newsom administration official, who did not want to be named because the official was not authorized to talk about the investigation, said that Ms. Williamson was placed on leave last year after she informed the office that she was interviewed by federal investigators and was under criminal investigation.\n\nMs. Williamson appeared in handcuffs in federal court in Sacramento on Wednesday afternoon, with glasses perched on her nose and her brown hair swept into a bun. She listened solemnly as Judge Carolyn Delaney read the charges against her, and as her lawyer entered a not-guilty plea on her behalf.\n\nMs. Williamson briefly turned around to look at the reporters sitting in the back of the courtroom. At one point, she raised her cuffed hand awkwardly to wipe a tear from her eye.\n\nShe faces up to 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine for each count of bank fraud, wire fraud, and conspiracy to commit bank and wire fraud. She faces less time for other counts, such as conspiracy to obstruct and making false statements.\n\nMatthew Rowan, Ms. Williamson's attorney, argued that she should not be held in jail before trial because she had no criminal history and was facing health problems.\n\nProsecutors said they had produced more than 27,000 pages of discovery and 752 gigabytes of iCloud data that would be part of their case. The next court date was set for Dec. 11.\n\nMr. Rowan declined to speak with reporters at the courtroom.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/12/us/newsom-aide-corruption-charges.html"}

But Gov. Gavin Newsom said that isn't the reason.\n\nNewsom said the revocations are for violations of state law, but he didn't provide specifics.\n\nThe Democratic governor's office said the unspecified violations were of state laws that were in place before the Republican Trump Administration recently tightened rules following a nationwide commercial driver's license audit launched after a driver in the country illegally made a U-turn and caused a crash in Florida that killed three people.\n\nFatal truck crashes in Texas and Alabama earlier this year also highlight questions about these licenses. A fiery California crash involving an illegal immigrant truck driver last month that killed three more people only added to the concerns.\n\nCalifornia state transportation officials didn't immediately respond to questions seeking more details about why these licenses are being revoked.\n\nU.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Wednesday that California's action to revoke these licenses is an admission that the state had acted improperly even though the state had previously defended its licensing standards.\n\nDuffy previously imposed new restrictions on which immigrants can qualify for one of these commercial driver's licenses. He said earlier this fall that California and five other states had improperly issued commercial driver's licenses to noncitizens, but California is the only state Duffy took action against. He revoked $40 million in federal funding because he said California isn't enforcing English language requirements for truckers, and he has promised to take away another $160 million from the state over these improperly issued licenses.\n\n''After weeks of claiming they did nothing wrong, Gavin Newsom and California have been caught red-handed. Now that we've exposed their lies, 17,000 illegally issued trucking licenses are being revoked,\" Duffy said. \"This is just the tip of iceberg. My team will continue to force California to prove they have removed every illegal immigrant from behind the wheel of semitrucks and school buses.\"\n\nNewsom's office said that every one of the drivers whose licenses are being revoked had valid work authorizations from the federal government.\n\n\"Once again, the Sean 'Road Rules' Duffy fails to share the truth -- spreading easily disproven falsehoods in a sad and desperate attempt to please his dear leader,\" Newsom's spokesman Brandon Richards said.\n\nThe new rules for commercial driver's licenses that Duffy announced in September make getting commercial driver's licenses extremely hard for immigrants because only three specific classes of visa holders will be eligible. States will also have to verify an applicant's immigration status in a federal database. These licenses will be valid for up to one year unless the applicant's visa expires sooner than that.\n\nUnder the new rules, only 10,000 of the 200,000 noncitizens who have commercial licenses would qualify for them, which would only be available to drivers who have an H-2a, H-2b or E-2 visa. H-2a is for temporary agricultural workers while H-2B is for temporary nonagricultural workers, and E-2 is for people who make substantial investments in a U.S. business. But the rules won't be enforced retroactively, so those 190,000 drivers will be allowed to keep their commercial licenses at least until they come up for renewal.\n\nNewsom's office said those new requirements were not in place at the time these 17,000 licenses were issued. But these drivers were given notices that their licenses will expire in 60 days.\n\nDuffy said in September that investigators found that one quarter of the 145 licenses they reviewed in California shouldn't have been issued. He cited four California licenses that remained valid after the driver's work permit expired -- sometimes years after.\n\nNewsom's office said the state followed guidance it received from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security about issuing these licenses to noncitizens.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Sophie Austin contributed to this report from Sacramento, California.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/california-revokes-17000-drivers-licenses-state-disputes-immigration-127467727"}

Gavin Newsom has been indicted on federal charges alleging her involvement in a scheme to steal campaign money from former federal Health Secretary Xavier Becerra.\n\nDana Williamson was arrested and was scheduled to make her first court appearance Wednesday in Sacramento. It was not immediately clear if she had an attorney who could speak on her behalf.\n\nThe federal indictment lists four other co-conspirators. It alleges that Williamson was part of a scheme involving Sean McCluskie, who was Becerra's chief of staff at the time of the alleged conduct.\n\nBecerra is a former California attorney general who was appointed health secretary by former President Joe Biden. He is not implicated in the indictment.\n\nThe indictment alleges that Williamson and McCluskie set up a system to take money from Becerra's dormant campaign account and funneled it to McCluskie, about $225,000 over a period of more than two years.\n\nAccording to the indictment, Williamson began helping McCluskie in April 2022 by using her political consulting company to bill Becerra's campaign account for purported services. The money would then be sent to McCluskie's wife for work supposedly done for Williamson.\n\nWhen Williamson prepared to join Newsom's office in late 2022, she arranged for \"Co-Conspirator 2\" - an unnamed former public official - to take over her role in the scheme.\n\nWilliamson was also charged with falsifying business contracts related to Paycheck Protection Program loans her business received during the COVID-19 pandemic. She allegedly asked an associate to create a retroactive contract saying her company provided services to his company so she would be eligible for the loans and loan forgiveness.\n\nThe indictment accuses Williamson of filing fraudulent tax forms for her business from 2021 to 2023 claiming more than $1 million in business deductions for personal expenses, including luxury handbags and jewelry; private jet travel; vacations in Mexico; installation of a home HVAC system; and several hundred thousands of dollars paid to various relatives for fake jobs.\n\nMcCluskie signed a plea deal Oct. 30, according to court filings, agreeing to plead to one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud and wire fraud and to pay $225,000 in restitution to Becerra.\n\nWilliamson was Newsom's chief of staff until late 2024.\n\nIn a statement, a spokesperson for the governor said: \"Ms. Williamson no longer serves in this administration. While we are still learning details of the allegations, the Governor expects all public servants to uphold the highest standards of integrity.\"\n\nBecerra could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\nThe investigation began more than three years ago, FBI Sacramento Special Agent in Charge Sid Patel said in a statement. That means it started under the Biden administration.\n\nWilliamson faces 23 charges including conspiracy to commit bank and wire fraud, bank fraud, conspiracy to defraud the United States and obstruct justice, subscribing to false tax returns and making false statements, the U.S. Attorney's Office said.\n\nIf convicted she could face up to 20 years in prison.\n\nWilliamson is a longtime Democratic power player in Sacramento. She was a Cabinet secretary for former Gov. Jerry Brown before opening her own political affairs firm. She was also Becerra's campaign manager when he ran for attorney general in 2018, and she later rejoined state government as Newsom's chief of staff.\n\n___\n\nDing reported from Los Angeles.

Such a convention cannot be limited; it would put everything in the Constitution up for grabs, including the method of ratification.\n\nThe purpose of an amendment to the Constitution is to correct a problem in the Constitution. Article I, Section 8 already places limits on what Congress can spend money on. The 10th Amendment already prohibits the U.S. government from legislating in the areas of education or health care in any way, at any time, for any reason.\n\nThe problem is not in the Constitution itself; it is that the Constitution is not being obeyed. Article V will not deal with that. Why would anyone think that if just a few more amendments were added, people who have been disregarding the Constitution will suddenly start to obey it?\n\nArticle V actually says that the states can only apply for the convention; it is Congress that would call it. Congress could assert that it has the authority to select the delegates, time and place of the meeting and the topics to be considered. Even if the states do select the delegates, what sort would current state governments send? I live in Maryland, and I believe our legislature would be far more likely to send a Bernie Sanders, Gavin Newsom or Elizabeth Warren than it would a Thomas Jefferson or James Madison. The political left would love to do away with the Electoral College and the Bill of Rights.\n\nThe 1787 Convention is the only precedent we have. Its delegates received commissions only to propose amendments to the Articles of Confederation. They instead created an entirely new document to replace the Articles altogether. Article 13 of the Articles required unanimous ratification by the states for any amendment to be approved. However, the delegates changed the rules, reducing the number from all to three-quarters. A new convention could and probably would do the same. One person has recommended 15 of the 20 most populous states. Another recommends a popular vote by the people.\n\nThe real solution is not Article V; it is Article VI, which requires every government official - U.S., state and local, elected and appointed - to swear an oath of office to obey and protect the Constitution. We need to hold our officials accountable to the Constitution and their oaths of office. I strongly recommend The New American's Freedom Index, which is updated twice a year and gives the voting record of each member of Congress in terms of fidelity to the Constitution and to their oaths of office.", "url": "https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2025/nov/12/letter-editor-need-constitutional-obedience-convention/"}

He refused to step up and take out Sen. Tim Kaine in 2024, got shellacked in 2025 and has allowed for the 2026 loss of at least two more congressional seats. But I suspect all of this losing may end up paying off for the nation in 2028.\n\nHopefully, President Trump will continue to disrupt the ossified federal government for the next three years and, unfortunately, upset a majority of Americans. Accordingly, Vice President JD Vance and/or Secretary of State Marco Rubio may catch much of the anger toward Mr. Trump.\n\nMr. Youngkin, by contrast, having not hurt Democrats for at least five years in a row, may be an attractive candidate for president in the general election. I suspect Mr. Trump may already know this. (Keep in mind that he Trump likes tall, good-looking, wealthy people.) Mr. Trump's endorsement would easily give Mr. Youngkin the Republican nomination. And Mr. Youngkin may have the best chance of beating Gavin Newsom.\n\nBut Mr. Youngkin, please consider making it easier for President Trump to endorse you. First, restore the name of Patrick Henry Community College. Henry is a favorite of President Trump. Mike Lindell has told me that every other time he speaks to Mr. Trump, the president calls Mr. Lindell a modern-day Patrick Henry. State Board of Community Colleges Chairman Mike Wooten, a Black retired Marine Corps Major, is waiting for your green light.\n\nYou could also urge Mr. Trump to tell Attorney General Pam Bondi to release the Marvin Bush-Mark Warner criminal files, which would force Mr. Warner's retirement. If you do it soon, could force it while you have the power to appoint Mr. Warner's replacement.\n\nThe Warner criminal file contains evidence of state crimes committed surrounding the Battle Creek Landfill in Page County, where former Virginia House Speaker Todd Gilbert works as an assistant commonwealth's attorney.

Kennedy famously implored a new generation of Americans to serve their country. Almost 64 years later, Jack Schlossberg, his only grandson, is now heeding the call for generational change from Democratic voters as the party's leaders continue to cling to office well into their 70s.\n\nSchlossberg, 32, announced Wednesday morning in a video posted to social media that he's running for the House seat of 78-year-old Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., who is set to retire after 34 years representing the heart of Manhattan. The video was not cheeky, controversial and eyebrow raising as much of his content as \"JackUno\" often is.\n\nInstead, Schlossberg notified his nearly 800,000 follower in a serious and earnest tone of his desire to represent his hometown district and fight against the Trump administration from within the halls of Congress.\n\n\"It's certainly time for a new generation of Americans to step up and ask what they can do for their country,\" Schlossberg said in an interview with MSNBC ahead of his announcement. \"And I think that it shouldn't just be about someone's age. It should be specifically about young candidates -- any age candidates -- who understand policy and how to compete in this political environment, which is toxic.\"\n\nLike other Democrats, Schlossberg sees President Donald Trump's policies and behavior as causing what he called corruption, affordability and constitutional crises. But unlike other elected Democrats and candidates, the New York City native is leaning into his influencer credentials to fuel his first run for elected office. He sees taking it to Trump on social media as not just clickbait but a necessity in an attention economy dominated by right-wing X posters, podcasters and YouTube influencers spreading the Trump gospel.\n\n\"One thing we can do is elect candidates who know how to communicate and cut back in this toxic political environment that we find ourselves in,\" Schlossberg said. \"New media is completely polluted and the air is dirty. I figured out a way to breathe in that environment, and we need to elect candidates who understand how to do that, and I think that's what makes me an effective representative.\"\n\nSchlossberg isn't shying away from the personal nature of the fight against Trump -- who has sought to dismantle the Kennedy legacy -- or against his cousin, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who Trump appointed Health and Human Services secretary after a failed presidential run that was Camelot-coded.\n\nSchlossberg's online following ballooned last year, in the lead-up to the 2024 presidential election, as he tried on various characters and presented his followers with accented impersonations. He was the first in his family to publicly criticize his cousin, and drew attention for trolling the now-HHS secretary and Trumpism.\n\nSchlossberg also appeared as a surrogate on the 2024 campaign trail, spending the months ahead of the election traveling the country and making cameos in viral videos with elected officials in hopes of turning out young voters. Schlossberg's \"trolling for a cause\" model, as he called it, recently has been embraced by high-profile Democrats such as California Gov. Gavin Newsom and others who have started posting slightly unhinged or lacerating social media messages directed at Trump and MAGA world, oftentimes in all caps and with exaggerated punctuation.\n\n\"In the lead-up to the 2024 election, I saw a problem that I wanted to do something about, and that's that the internet and new media is dominated by the right -- and it has been for a decade,\" said Schlossberg. \"I want to offer a different perspective, an alternative perspective, and get the Democratic Party's message out there to reach people. So I use my own creativity, a little bit of courage, to put my neck out there and speak up for what I believe in. And I learned a lot doing that.\"\n\nBut Schlossberg's in-real-life takeaway from his experience on the campaign trail wasn't as sarcastic or mischievous, departing from his online brand.\n\n\"I learned that the Democratic Party is not dead or dying there,\" he added. \"I met thousands of people across the country. I went to almost every single swing state, and I met people, young and old, who are excited to join our cause and do whatever they can to stop this president from enacting his agenda.\"\n\nSchlossberg joins a growing primary field for Nadler's heavily Democratic district in which a primary win is tantamount to victory. Micah Lasher, a New York state assembly member and Nadler prot\u00e9g\u00e9, jumped into the race in September, along with Liam Elkind, a 26-year-old nonprofit founder. Nadler told The New York Times last month that any endorsement of a successor \"is way down the road.\"\n\nIf elected, Schlossberg could serve in Congress while his cousin holds a Cabinet position. As HHS secretary, RFK Jr. has departed radically from his uncle's Democratic legacy, slashing health research funding, laying off hundreds of federal workers, and weakening vaccine policy. Schlossberg argued that fighting the Trump administration is not just about his family's legacy, but about the \"generations of Americans and New Yorkers who fought and sacrificed to build this country.\"", "url": "https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/news/jack-schlossberg-running-congress-house-nadler-kennedy-rcna243329"}

Gavin Newsom of California on Tuesday cast himself as the \"stable and reliable\" American partner to the world, called a reported White House proposal to open offshore drilling in the waters off California \"disgraceful\" and urged his fellow Democrats to recast climate change as a \"cost of living issue.\"\n\nMr. Newsom, a Democrat who is widely considered to be weighing a 2028 presidential bid, used his appearance at the United Nations climate summit in Bel\u00e9m, Brazil, to paint President Trump as a threat to American competitiveness by letting China dominate electric vehicles, solar panels and other clean energy technologies of the future.\n\n\"The United States of America better wake up at that,\" Mr. Newsom said at one of his many packed sessions at the climate conference, known as COP30. \"It's not about electric power. It's about economic power. We, as the state of California, are not going to cede that race to China.\"\n\nWhile the Trump administration opted not to send any representatives to the summit, China is using its pavilion inside the event to promote its successes.\n\nTaylor Rogers, a White House spokeswoman, criticized Mr. Newsom, saying he \"flew all the way to Brazil to tout the Green New Scam, while Californians are paying some of the highest energy prices in the country.\" In a statement, she said \"these Green Dreams are killing other countries, but will not kill ours thanks to President Trump's commonsense energy agenda.\"\n\nAs the most prominent American official at the summit, Mr. Newsom was trailed by crowds at the conference. Going from one packed event to the next, the governor stopped to talk to admirers, waved to an applauding crowd at one point and entertained questions from the media, with the United Nations security detail having trouble getting him to events on time. It was his first appearance at an international climate conference and it was all the more notable because of the absence of an official United States delegation.\n\n\"Donald Trump didn't show up at COP30 but California did,\" Mr. Newsom said.\n\nMr. Trump has disavowed global climate cooperation by withdrawing the United States from the Paris climate accord, pressured other countries to buy more American oil and gas and blocked renewable energy projects at home.\n\nMr. Newsom called the administration's pullout from the global pact \"an abomination.\" The United States is the only country to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, in which 194 other nations pledged to keep global warming to relatively safe levels.\n\nThe governor's series of events ended shortly before a group of Indigenous protesters forced their way into the venue and clashed with security guards at the entrance, according to Reuters. They were protesting the incursion of mining, logging and agriculture in forested lands.\n\nThe governor said nothing about his national ambitions, even when asked directly, insisting that he was focused on ensuring that next year's midterm elections were not undermined by the Trump administration. Mr. Newsom's trip to Bel\u00e9m came on the heels of a successful ballot initiative that could help California Democrats flip up to five congressional seats.\n\n\"If there's one message I want to deliver to all of you, it is that California distinguishes itself from the current occupant in the White House in Washington, D.C.,\" Mr. Newsom said. \"California is a stable and reliable partner.\"\n\nCalifornia produces more electricity from renewable energy, including solar and wind power, than any state except Texas. It established the country's first statewide cap-and-trade program, a system that allows polluters to trade permits for emissions, which Mr. Newsom recently extended to 2045.\n\nThe governor waded into issues well beyond the confines of California and climate change. He said it was \"chilling\" to see images of U.S. bombardment of suspected drug ships off the coast of Venezuela without congressional approval. He called Mr. Trump a \"bully.\"\n\nHe urged climate advocates, including in his own party, to reframe the way they talk about climate change, less in abstract terms and more as a force that affects people's pocketbooks.\n\n\"It's about affordability. It's about time we frame it accordingly,\" Mr. Newsom said of his efforts to ramp up renewable energy in his state. \"We're here to frame it in economic terms, in cost-of-living terms.\"\n\nThe Biden administration's sweeping investment in electric vehicles and renewable energy did not resonate with voters in 2024. \"We have some work to do as a party, as a nation,\" Mr. Newsom said.\n\nIn fact, concerns about the cost of fuel in California forced Mr. Newsom to go easy on oil and gas lately. Just two years ago, Mr. Newsom was a combative critic of the fossil fuel industry. In 2023, the state sued ExxonMobil, Shell, BP, ConocoPhillips and others, alleging that they had misled the public about climate change.\n\nBut this year, Mr. Newsom enacted changes to make it easier to drill for oil. Asked about that contradiction on Tuesday, he said it was a \"pragmatic\" move endorsed by the State Legislature.\n\nHe said he would sue, if necessary, to block a reported White House proposal to issue oil drilling permits off the coast of California. \"Dead on arrival,\" Mr. Newsom said. He noted that Mr. Trump had not proposed offshore drilling off the coast near Mar-a-Lago, his resort in Florida.\n\n\"Disgraceful,\" Mr. Newsom said.\n\nIvan Penn contributed reporting from S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/11/climate/gavin-newsom-cop30-belem-climate.html"}

Gavin Newsom said Tuesday the United States risks being left behind as an economic power.\n\nNewsom, a Democrat eyeing a 2028 presidential run, is so far the highest profile of several U.S. governors and mayors at U.N. climate talks being hosted in Belem, Brazil. They say they are here to tell the 195 nations who are trying to fight climate change that much of the United States is doing its best despite Trump administration policies overturning environmental regulations and aiding the production of dirty fuels, such as coal, while stymying green energies like wind and solar.\n\nAs he did during his first term, President Donald Trump is also pulling America from the 2015 Paris Agreement, which set international goals to limit average global temperature rise.\n\nNewsom's presence as governor of the most populous U.S. state serves to draw a clear contrast with Trump's absence. He said Trump's decision to skip the talks tells the world: \"You don't matter, we don't care.\"\n\n\"This idea that somehow we can put up walls, we can put up barriers, we could put up tariffs, we put up our middle fingers and just turn our back is lunacy,\" Newsom said during an exclusive Associated Press interview at the climate talks in Belem, a city on the edge of the Amazon rainforest. \"And every other country in the world understands that. That's why every other country in this world is moving in a different direction.\"\n\nEven Russia and Saudi Arabia get it and are going green, but not Trump, Newsom said. U.N. organizers said only four nations are absent from the negotiations called COP30: Strife-torn Afghanistan and Myanmar, tiny San Marino and the United States, which over the century has put more heat-trapping carbon dioxide in the air than any other nation.\n\nPHOTOS: AP Interview: Newsom says Trump climate-fighting absence is 'doubling down on stupid'\n\nCalifornia, with nearly 40 million residents, is a major economic hub and on the forefront of national climate policy. But the Trump administration has sought to role back the state's power to set aggressive climate policy, most notably by blocking a California regulation to ban the sale of new gas-powered cars within the next decade.\n\n\"This Trump administration, his acolytes and the supine Congress led by Speaker (Mike) Johnson, are doubling down on stupid,\" Newsom said.\n\n\"We're ceding cheap energy, green energy, infrastructure, supply chain manufacturing. We're ceding economic power to other countries, notably China, taking advantage of that absence,\" Newsom said. \"And they're going to clean our clock economically unless we wake up to the economic imperative and opportunities of low carbon regrowth.\"\n\nTrump, who actively solicited money from the fossil fuel industry during his last campaign, has massively deregulated industry that spews heat-trapping gas and cut subsidies to renewable energy. This would give America -- the No. 1 oil producer in the world -- energy independence and cheaper prices, he has said.\n\n\"Governor Newscum flew all the way to Brazil to tout the Green New Scam, while the people of California are paying some of the highest energy prices in the country. Embarrassing!,\" White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said in a statement, using one of Trump's favored nicknames for Newsom. \"President Trump will not allow the best interest of the American people to be jeopardized by the Green Energy Scam. These Green Dreams are killing other countries, but will not kill ours thanks to President Trump's common sense energy agenda.\"\n\nClimate change is undeniable, despite Trump calling it a hoax, Newsom said.\n\n\"If you don't believe in science, and a lot of people apparently don't, you have to believe in your own eyes,\" Newsom said. \"Nighttime temperatures, record-breaking heat globally, acidification of our oceans, impacts on our coral reefs. You're not able to go where your grandfather brought you for the first time, your dad brought you and bring your kids because there's another fire and it's another closure and the air quality's been degraded.\"\n\nCalifornia has warmed 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit (1 degree Celsius) in the past 30 years and gets nearly 7 inches of rain (17.7 centimeters) less now than it did in 1995, according to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration records.\n\nSome of California's largest and most destructive wildfires in history have sparked in the last five years, including two January infernos that devastated neighborhoods in and around Los Angeles. The previous winter, meanwhile, brought record-breaking rainfall as multiple atmospheric rivers pounded the state.\n\n\"I'm just privileged to represent one of the most blessed and cursed states in the world that's on the tip of the spear of the impacts of climate change,\" Newsom said. \"How about the simultaneous crisis of wildfires, drought, and floods stacked on top of each other.\"\n\n\"Anyone paying attention here?\" added Newsom.\n\nAt home, Newsom has confronted the economic and political realities of pursuing the state's ambitious goal of by 2045 reaching carbon neutrality, or taking as much carbon pollution from the atmosphere as emitted. He recently signed legislation to boost oil production in part of the state and his party has grappled with how to confront high gas prices. California also has some of the highest electricity rates in the country.\n\nCalifornia is also dealing with the massive energy and water demands of data centers by keeping its last nuclear plant running longer than planned, adding huge chunks of solar power and battery storage and investing in nuclear fusion, Newsom said. Those energy needs will grow as AI continues to boom. Many of the nation's top AI companies are headquartered in California.\n\nVeteran climate negotiations analyst Alden Meyer of the European think tank E3G said it was unfortunate that America's federal government was not participating in the talks.\n\n\"But it is very positive that we have these other leaders from the United States that are here in Belem,\" he said.\n\n___\n\nAnton L.

Gavin Newsom was the most prominent American official to attend the COP30 global climate conference in Bel\u00e9m, Brazil, this week -- using the platform to criticize the absent Trump administration.\n\nThe White House mocked the trip, noting California's continued rank among the highest in U.S. energy costs.\n\nNewsom's office put out a summary of his visit to the conference, saying it shows California is \"leading by example\" and proving that \"climate action and economic growth go hand in hand.\"\n\n\"As Donald Trump abandons American climate leadership, California continues and accelerates its climate action, urging global investors to embrace the technologies and infrastructure driving the clean energy future,\" his office said in the release.\n\nNEWSOM SET TO RALLY TEXAS DEMS WITH VICTORY LAP DAYS AFTER PROP 50 PASSES: 'CALIFORNIA STEPPED UP'\n\nOn Tuesday, Newsom was scheduled to deliver remarks in his role as co-chair of America Is All In, which describes itself as a broad coalition of non-federal actors in the U.S. committed to ambitious climate action.

He joined the Network in 2019 as CBS News' Asia correspondent, based in Beijing and reporting across the Asia-Pacific, bringing two decades of experience working and traveling between Asia and the United States.\n\nIn Bel\u00e9m, the bustling Brazilian gateway to the Amazon rainforest, leaders from nearly 200 nations have gathered for the United Nations' 30th Climate Change Conference, known as COP30, to chart difficult next steps in the global fight against climate change. But the absence of the leaders from the world's three largest greenhouse gas emitters -- China, the United States and India -- cast a shadow over the summit as it kicked off.\n\nBeijing and New Delhi did dispatch senior-level delegations for the two-week summit. The White House, however, said no high-level U.S. officials would attend this year's COP. President Trump has repeatedly dismissed human-caused climate change as \"a hoax.\"\n\nTwo Democratic governors, California's Gavin Newsom and New Mexico's Michelle Lujan Grisham, were in Brazil to attend the summit, representing state-level U.S. efforts to curb emissions.\n\n\"What the hell is going on here?\" Newsom asked at a global investors' summit in S\u00e3o Paulo on Monday, where he fired off a characteristic criticism of the Trump administration. \"We're in Brazil -- one of our great trading partners, one of the world's great democracies. Home to all the rare earth metals we need. This is the country we should be engaging with, not slapping with 50% tariffs.\"\n\nTen years ago, 195 nations taking part in the COP21 summit signed onto the landmark Paris Agreement, intended to commit individual nations to take measures that, collectively, would limit the rise in average global temperatures to \"well below\" 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit). The objective in the agreement, which the Obama administration signed, was to pursue efforts to cap the global temperature increase at 1.5\u00b0C (2.7\u00b0F) above pre-industrial levels.\n\nThat target now appears out of reach.\n\nBased on national plans submitted this year, the planet is on course to warm by roughly 2.5\u00b0C (4.5\u00b0F) during this century. The Earth's average surface temperature in 2024 was the hottest since record keeping began in 1880 -- and the last 10 years have all ranked among the warmest ever observed.\n\nStill, U.N. Climate Change Executive Secretary Simon Stiell told delegates in Brazil this week that after three decades of dedicated talks, \"we are now bending the curve of planet heating emissions downwards -- for the very first time.\"\n\n\"I am not sugarcoating it,\" Stiell hastened to add. \"We have so much more work to do.\"\n\nA new U.N. analysis released this week shows that, if current national commitments are met, global emissions should fall by about 12% by 2035 compared to 2019 levels. That's an improvement from last month's projection of 10%, but still far short of the 60% reduction scientists say would be needed to keep warming within the Paris Agreement's 1.5\u00b0C goal.\n\nU.N. Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres has been pressing for stronger action, warning that surpassing the 1.5\u00b0C limit now looks almost inevitable and slamming it as both a \"moral failure\" and \"deadly negligence\" putting the lives of billions of people at risk.\n\nDespite low expectations for any sweeping breakthroughs, the delegations at COP30 are broadly expected to update national commitments to curb emissions in the next decade.\n\nA Brazil-led initiative to raise $125 billion for rainforest protection, coupled with renewed scrutiny of fossil fuel companies -- which Guterres accused of \"holding back change\" while collecting record profits and government subsidies -- were also expected to come out of the two-week gathering.\n\nThere is also likely to be more pressure applied on the governments of wealthy nations to help finance climate adaptations around the world, to help developing countries mitigate the impacts of a warming planet.\n\nAt last year's COP29 in Baku, Azerbaijan, countries agreed on an aspirational goal of mobilizing $1.3 trillion annually by 2035, with at least $300 billion expected to come from developing economies.\n\nPublicly available data on how much climate finance has actually been delivered since then, however, remains scarce, and that could be a key point of contention for the negotiators gathered in Bel\u00e9m to discuss.", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/miami/news/trump-skips-cop30-climate-summit-newsom-criticism-tariffs/"}

Aro...", "content": "Los Angeles -- Kris Edwards waited at home with friends for his wife, Erika \"Tilly\" Edwards, to go out to dinner, but she never made it back to the house they had purchased only four days earlier. Around 9 p.m. on June 29, a hit-and-run driver killed Tilly as she walked to her car after a fundraiser performance in Hollywood.\n\n\"I've just got to figure out how to keep living. And the hard part with that is not knowing why,\" Edwards said of his wife's death.\n\nDespite local, state, and federal safety campaigns, such as the global Vision Zero initiative to eliminate traffic fatalities, such deaths are up 20% in the U.S. from a decade ago, from 32,744 in 2014 to an estimated 39,345 in 2024, according to data from the Department of Transportation's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Although traffic deaths have declined since peaking at 43,230 in 2021, the number of deaths remains higher than a decade ago.\n\nSince the COVID-19 pandemic, the Pew Research Center found, Americans' driving habits have worsened across multiple measures, from reckless driving to drunk driving, which road safety advocates call a public health failure. They say technology could dramatically reduce traffic deaths, but proposals often run up against industry resistance, and the Trump administration is focusing on driverless cars to both innovate and improve public safety.\n\n\"Every day, 20 people go out for a walk, and they don't return home,\" said Adam Snider, a spokesperson for the Governors Highway Safety Association, which represents state road safety offices.\n\nAmerican roads have become more dangerous than violent crimes in some cities: Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Houston are among the major cities that now report more traffic fatalities than homicides. In 2024, the Los Angeles Police Department reported an estimated 268 homicides and 302 traffic deaths, the second consecutive year that the number of people killed in collisions exceeded the number of homicide victims, according to Crosstown LA, a nonprofit community news outlet.\n\nSan Francisco reported 42 traffic deaths and 35 homicides in 2024. In Houston, approximately 345 people died in crashes and 322 from homicide.\n\n\"Simply put, the United States is in the middle of a road safety emergency,\" David Harkey, president of the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, testified during a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee hearing this summer. Harkey said that, out of 29 high-income countries, America ranks at the bottom in road safety. \"This spike is not -- I repeat, is not -- a global trend. The U.S. is an outlier.\"\n\nIn January 2017, then-Mayor Eric Garcetti joined 13 other L.A. city leaders in pledging to implement the Vision Zero action plan and eliminate traffic deaths in the city by 2025.\n\nInstead, deaths have increased.\n\nAn audit released in April that was commissioned by the city's administrative officer found that the level of enthusiasm for the program at City Hall has diminished and that it suffered because of \"the pandemic, conflicts of personality, lack of total buy-in for implementation, disagreements over how the program should be administered, and scaling issues.\" The report also cited competing interests among city departments and inconsistent investment in the city's most dangerous traffic corridors.\n\nMayor Karen Bass' office did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nLast year, California state Sen. Scott Wiener proposed a bill that would have required new cars sold in the state to include \"intelligent speed assistance,\" software that could prevent vehicles from exceeding the speed limit by more than 10 mph. But the bill was watered down following pushback from the auto industry and opposition from some legislators who called it government overreach. It was ultimately vetoed by Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, who said a state mandate would disrupt ongoing federal safety assessments.\n\nMeanwhile, the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, an influential automotive lobby, this year sued the federal government over an automatic emergency braking rule adopted during the Biden administration. The lawsuit is pending in federal court while the Department of Transportation completes a review. Even before Donald Trump was sworn in for his second term, the alliance appealed to the president-elect in a letter to support consumer choice.\n\nUnder President Trump, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy is prioritizing the development of autonomous vehicles by proposing sweeping regulatory changes to test and deploy driverless cars. \"Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards were written for vehicles with human drivers and need to be updated for autonomous vehicles,\" NHTSA Chief Counsel Peter Simshauser said in September in announcing the modernization effort, which includes repealing some safety rules. \"Removing these requirements will reduce costs and enhance safety.\"\n\nSome Democratic lawmakers, however, have criticized the administration's repeal of safety rules as misguided since new rules can be implemented without undoing existing safeguards. NHTSA officials did not respond to requests for comment about Democrats' concerns.\n\nAdvocates worry that without continued adoption of road safety regulations for conventional vehicles, factors such as excessive speed and human error will continue to drive fatalities despite the push for driverless cars.\n\n\"We need to continue to have strong collaboration from the federal, state, local sectors, public sector, private sector, the everyday public,\" Snider, of the Governors Highway Safety Association, said. \"We need everyday drivers to get involved.\"\n\nIt took nearly a month for police to track down the driver of a Mercedes-Benz G-Wagen allegedly involved in Tilly's death. Authorities have charged Davontay Robins with vehicular manslaughter with gross negligence, felony hit-and-run driving, and driving with a suspended license due to a previous DUI. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges and is out on bail.\n\nKris Edwards now tends to the couple's backyard garden by himself. Since his wife's death, he has experienced sleep deprivation, fatigue, and trouble eating, and he relies on a cane to walk. His doctors attribute his ailments to the brain's response to grief.\n\n\"I'm not alone,\" he said. \"But I am lonely, in this big, empty house without my partner.\"\n\nEdwards hopes for justice for his wife, though he said he's unsure if prosecutors will get a conviction. He wants her death to mean something: safer streets, slower driving, and for pedestrians to be cautious when getting in and out of cars parked on busy streets.\n\n\"I want my wife's death to be a warning to others who get too comfortable and let their guard down even for a moment,\" he said. \"That moment is all it takes.\"\n\nKFF Health News is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at KFF -- the independent source for health policy research, polling, and journalism.", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/sanfrancisco/news/us-cities-traffic-deaths-los-angeles/"}

Gavin Newsom?\n\nA quick-hit look at the wake of the election results might suggest Democrats have the winning message and that voters are tired of the MAGA movement, and as such, Americans pulled the poll levers for the left. But this isn't exactly what occurred.\n\nReally, the fact that Democrats -- that is to say, socialists, and that is really actually, truly, more to truth say, communists -- have any wins at all is due to three causes: 1) the flood of illegal immigrants; 2) the dumbing of America's youth; and 3) the media.\n\nOn the first: Democrats have gleefully opened borders for years, nay, decades, as a means of ushering in the next batch of faithful followers, err, sheep, who will, by their presence, tilt Census Bureau census findings to apportion more representatives in left-leaning states. If they can vote illegally in elections along the way to the next census count, all the better, say Democrats.\n\nOn the second: Today's youth have been steadily taught to dislike America, detest capitalism, distance themselves from God and to blame America for all the world's ills; fault America's founders for giving us a racist Constitution; and slam America's conservative politicians as discriminatory and unjust for insisting on a government that stays limited in scope, i.e., that doesn't use tax dollars to provide for the people, cradle to grave. The public schools have taught this for decades. The colleges and universities have harped on this for decades. What's resulted is a class of Americans who see nothing wrong with voting for a communist -- who in fact characterize communists as good American patriots.\n\nOn the third: It's the media, stupid. This is where the true evil genius of the evil ones of the left shines. For far too long, members of the media have skated accountability for errors, all the while skirting long-held standards of serving as the truth-bearers for the American people. They've only watchdogged when watchdogging can take down a MAGA. They've only tried to dig at truths when it involves an accusation slung a Republican's way. Hunter Biden and the laptop? Ignore. Censor. Donald Trump and collusion with Russia? Build up and boy, oh, boy, don't let it drift from the public consciousness. Use a pee tape if you must -- find some prostitutes if you can -- but whatever the deal, whatever the dirt, dig and dig and dig and don't stop digging. It's that old adage, repeat a lie often enough and it becomes truth.\n\nBBC's top executives just learned a lesson about lying to the public when two of them, the director-general, Tim Davie, and the CEO of news, Deborah Turness, resigned in disgrace after they were outed for allowing into an aired documentary some creative edits that seemed to show President Trump telling supporters to violently storm the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nHere's the thing, though.\n\nThey were only feeling the disgrace because they were caught in their lie.\n\nThey weren't feeling the disgrace because of their actual despicable lie.\n\nAnd this is how the media have operated for a very long time: Lie, lie until the lies become truths, and if any lies are actually outed as lies -- well then, roll whatever heads necessary to smooth things over and move on to the next lie.\n\nIf it weren't for the lies of the media, Zohran Mamdani's win as New York City mayor wouldn't have happened because members of the media would have told the truths about communism and anti-semitism and his ties to radical Islamic clerics. If it weren't for the lies of the media, Democrats wouldn't have swept through Virginia and taken New Jersey and won on Proposition 50 because voters would have been aware of how damaging -- how radical -- how anti-America all these candidates and proposals and ideas of the left are to the country. Voters, if voters were properly enlightened by a truthful press, would never vote Democrat, that is to really say, socialist, that is really to say, communist, again.\n\nIt's the media, stupid.\n\nIt's the propaganda passed off as news, combined with the dumbing down of the voting class.\n\nWithout their coddling, fawning friends in the media, Democrats would disappear from political power.", "url": "https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2025/nov/11/democrat-election-wins-showcase-power-media-lies/"}

So right now everyone's taking advantage of it. A lot of criminals are. They're really abusing the system, and that's the unfortunate part about it.\"\n\nIn a post shared last week on the department's official Facebook page, Cooper criticized state diversion policies, writing that \"career criminals [are] using mental health as a shield to avoid consequences.\"\n\nBLUE CITY DA SAYS REPEAT DRUG OFFENDERS 'WILL NOT RESPECT THE LAW' UNDER CURRENT SYSTEM\n\nCalifornia's mental health diversion law, passed in 2018 under AB 1810 and SB 215, gives defendants the ability to pause their criminal cases and enter a court-approved treatment program instead of going to jail.\n\nIf they complete treatment successfully, their charges are dismissed and their record is wiped clean, Cooper explained.\n\nThe law was designed to help people whose mental illness contributed to their crimes get treatment rather than punishment.\n\nBut it goes much further than many realize.\n\nOnly a few crimes are excluded - murder, voluntary manslaughter, rape and sex crimes requiring registration. Everything else, from child abuse to armed robbery, can qualify for diversion.\n\nEven the list of mental health conditions that count toward eligibility is broad.\n\nAccording to the state's own guidelines, nearly any diagnosis listed in the DSM-5, the manual doctors used to define mental disorders, can qualify.\n\nNEWSOM JUST MADE A CATASTROPHIC MISTAKE ON CALIFORNIA'S HOMELESSNESS DISASTER\n\nThe only exceptions are borderline personality disorder, antisocial personality disorder and pedophilia.\n\nLawmakers have tried to tighten those rules.\n\nAssembly Bill 433, introduced by Assemblymember Maggy Krell, would prevent defendants charged with child abuse, endangerment or serious injury crimes from being diverted.\n\nCooper's office called it \"a big step in the right direction, but much is left to be done.\"\n\nCooper said some of the most shocking crimes he's seen in decades are now being swept into California's mental health diversion system, including cases where babies were tortured or killed, and the suspects still qualified for diversion instead of prison.\n\n\"If you beat your kid to death, you should not be around kids,\" Cooper said. \"When he got diversion, it erased his record... He can be a teacher, a coach -- and that's scary.\"\n\nBLUE CITY ERUPTS AS 91-TIME FELON TRIES TO DODGE PRISON, WEASEL INTO REHAB AFTER CRASH\n\nAccording to the Sacramento County Sheriff's Office, recent cases include:\n\nCooper said those cases show how the law has gone far beyond its original intent, with the current system leaving judges with no flexibility.\n\n\"We've seen some horrific cases here in Sacramento and really across the state of California,\" he said. \"It ties the judges' hands... they don't have a choice to grant diversion.\"\n\nAccording to the Sheriff's Office, brothers Adam and Juan Velasquez, both known as Howe Park Sure\u00f1o gang members, were convicted of violently attacking an innocent man in an unprovoked assault. Deputies said the victim was blindsided, knocked unconscious and seriously injured simply because the suspects perceived him as a rival.\n\nSUPREME COURT SKEPTICAL OF 'CONVERSION THERAPY' LAW BANNING TREATMENT OF MINORS WITH GENDER IDENTITY ISSUES\n\nWhile both were arrested for felonies, officials noted that Juan Velasquez was granted mental health diversion instead of serving jail time.\n\nIn May, while out on probation, the brothers allegedly struck again. The sheriff's office said they confronted another man who was dining with his family at a restaurant, shouted gang slurs, tried to assault and stab the victim with a knife, and then slashed his tires before fleeing.\n\nThe victim again had no gang affiliation. Deputies arrested Adam Velasquez in August, and Juan Velasquez was located and arrested later by the sheriff's gang detectives.\n\n\"These bad guys know there is zero accountability... They talk about it in our jails. We've got them on record talking about mental health diversion -- how to exploit it and get out of their cases,\" Cooper said.\n\nIn another example cited by the Sheriff's Office, 44-year-old Darren Campoy was arrested this month by robbery detectives outside his Roseville home. Deputies said Campoy had robbed the Sacramento Credit Union on Oct. 15, 2025, handing a teller a note demanding cash and walking out with $2,460.\n\nAccording to the sheriff's post, Campoy was already on Post-Release Community Supervision (PRCS) from Placer County for a 2021 bank robbery. Earlier this year, he was granted mental health diversion, which Cooper said erased his criminal proceedings so that he could receive \"treatment\" instead of jail time.\n\n\"If they complete treatment successfully, their charges are dismissed,\" Cooper said, calling it a process that \"effectively erases the defendant's record.\"\n\nPARENTAL RIGHTS CONCERNS ERUPT OVER CALIFORNIA BILL THAT WOULD LET NON-RELATIVES MAKE DECISIONS FOR KIDS\n\nDespite a long criminal record, including armed robbery, reckless driving and evading police, and what psychologists reportedly described as a \"higher risk to public safety,\" Campoy was released. Less than a year later, deputies said, he robbed a bank again.\n\n\"Less than a year later, he's back to robbing banks. That's a result of terrible laws. And it's exactly what happens when accountability gets replaced with excuses,\" the sheriff's office wrote.\n\nCooper said the current system has created a revolving door that puts the public at risk.\n\n\"People need to be held accountable when they commit these types of crimes. Right now, anyone in jail, anyone and everyone are basically applying for mental health diversion and a lot of them are getting it because in the court system, it ties their hands,\" he continued.\n\nHe added that his deputies routinely see suspects discussing how to claim mental health conditions after the fact to qualify for leniency.\n\n\"It really makes it harder to do your job. And these bad guys know there is zero accountability that they can get away with these crimes, nothing's gonna happen.\"\n\nWhen reached for comment, a spokesperson for Gov. Gavin Newsom told Fox News Digital that the state's diversion policy is determined by the courts, not the governor.\n\n\"Under Penal Code section 1001.36, the decision to refer a defendant to mental health diversion is solely within a judge's discretion,\" the spokesperson said. \"The governor does not review individual cases and cannot determine whether repeat offenders should be admitted -- that is up to the judge hearing the case.\"\n\nThe spokesperson added that Newsom \"is committed to effective public safety,\" and said the purpose of the diversion law is to ensure that \"when people who commit crimes because of a mental health disorder receive necessary treatment, the public is safer.\"\n\n\"That is the heart of the mental health diversion statute,\" the spokesperson said, adding that the governor \"would take into consideration any bill that lands on his desk.\"\n\nNewsom's office also noted that several serious offenses are not eligible for diversion under state law, including murder, voluntary manslaughter, rape, child sexual abuse and crimes involving weapons of mass destruction or DUI offenses.\n\nThe sheriff said he plans to keep pushing for reform when the Legislature reconvenes next year.\n\n\"We'll be back in January and battle this bill that's pending to make diversion even more widespread,\" Cooper said.\n\nAnd until the law changes, Cooper said, his department will keep exposing the cases that highlight what he calls a \"broken system.\"\n\n\"We're gonna hold folks accountable as much as we can,\" he said. \"When it goes awry, we're gonna let you know about it and we're not going to sit on it.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nCalifornia's mental health diversion law (AB 1810) allows certain defendants to pause criminal proceedings and enter treatment instead of serving jail time, with charges dismissed upon successful completion. Lawmakers intended the policy to reduce incarceration among people whose mental illness contributed to their crimes.\n\n\"The idea behind diversion laws was to help those who commit low-level crimes because of treatable mental illness,\" the sheriff's office wrote. \"But what we have now are career criminals using 'mental health' as a shield to avoid consequences - and this is the result.\"", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/us/california-mental-health-loophole-frees-killers-crooks-terrible-laws-sheriff-warns"}

Gavin Newsom speaks to reporters in Stockton, California, on Oct. 22. (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)\n\nBill Whalen, the Hoover Institution's Virginia Hobbs Carpenter Distinguished Policy Fellow in Journalism, was chief speechwriter to former California governor Pete Wilson.\n\nAs tempting as it may be to view the New Jersey and Virginia gubernatorial votes as Democratic temperature checks, a more telling thermometer may exist farther west: the race to succeed a term limited Gov. Gavin Newsom in California.\n\nThis may seem odd given that the Golden State is arguably the most azure of America's \"blue\" states. Apart from Arnold Schwarzenegger, no Republican has won a California gubernatorial contest in more than three decades. The average Democratic margin of victory in the four post-Arnold races? Almost 19 points.\n\nYet, California's 2026 contest bears watching for two reasons: an uncharacteristically wide-open primary lacking a governor-in-waiting, which wasn't the case the last two times there was no incumbent on the ballot, and a bevy of Democratic hopefuls engaged in a balancing act of appealing to an electorate that believes the Golden State is on the wrong track while not holding their party at least partially responsible for that sour mood. (Democrats currently occupy all of California's statewide constitutional offices and enjoy supermajority control of both legislative chambers.)\n\nAbout the California field: To the extent that there was a front-runner after former vice president Kamala Harris took herself out of the running, it was former congresswoman Katie Porter. But her lead always rested on the political quicksand of simple name recognition from having competed in last year's U.S. Senate primary. It remains to be seen what damage she has suffered from recent bad press regarding her temperament.\n\nWho, then, to fill the void? At least three other Democrats -- all with flaws -- could jump in.\n\nSen. Alex Padilla may decide he wants to relocate to Sacramento, but he has little to show in the way of accomplishments since replacing Kamala Harris in Washington four years ago. (One September gubernatorial poll shows 7 percent support for California's senior U.S. senator.)\n\nClimate investor Tom Steyer, who starred in self-financed and brutally anti-Trump ads in support of Proposition 50 and a mid-decade redrawing of California's congressional map, suddenly became front and center on voters' streaming devices. (Some local Democrats critiqued Steyer's late involvement as self-serving.) But his political record is notable for its futility: more than $150 million wasted on a failed presidential bid in 2020.\n\nAnd there's Rick Caruso, the Los Angeles developer and billionaire who, judging from his social media feed, can't decide whether he wants to be the state's next governor or his city's next mayor. That Caruso was an 11th-hour party convert when he ran for mayor in 2022 is something his primary rivals will probably reference.\n\nThe gubernatorial primary isn't until June 2, which gives Democratic hopefuls about seven months to lay out policy agendas. But there's a catch: To land Newsom's current day job, those hopefuls have to work around a Newsom flaw -- his overpromising when applying for the same position.\n\nSeven years ago, on the precipice of succeeding the more centrist Jerry Brown, Newsom vowed to steer California hard to port. In his words: \"Guaranteed health care for all. A 'Marshall Plan' for affordable housing. A master plan for aging with dignity. A middle-class workforce strategy. A cradle-to-college promise for the next generation. An all-hands approach to ending child poverty.\"\n\nWith a year left in office, Newsom hasn't made good on that ambitious agenda. California's child poverty rate nearly tripled from 2021 to 2024. The goal of building 2.5 million homes by 2030 (downgraded from 3.5 million) won't be reached at the current pace. After expanding Medi-Cal (the state's Medicaid program) to include all Californians regardless of legal status, the latest state budget scaled back health care for undocumented immigrants -- a shift that speaks to the Golden State's fiscal woes and perhaps the governor's presidential ambitions.\n\nDoes this mean that, now that California has voted on the Trump referendum that was Proposition 50 and attention should turn back to conditions on the ground, a Golden State Democratic candidate might dare to disparage the governor's record? It would be a calculated risk -- calculating how to survive California's \"open\" primary, where the top two vote-getters advance to the general election regardless of party affiliation.\n\nDesigned to encourage candidates to reach out to the middle with a more centrist appeal, the opposite occurred in 2018's open primary when Newsom, well ahead in the polls, spent money attacking conservative John Cox to elevate the Republican to second place. By doing so, Newsom avoided a more competitive runoff against former Los Angeles mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, who is once again a gubernatorial candidate.\n\nBut in a field currently lacking a Democrat with the same standing that Newsom enjoyed seven years ago -- as lieutenant governor, he ramped up for higher office by championing successful ballot measures on gun control and marijuana legalization -- no Democrat is likely to approach his 33.7 percent share of the primary vote (Democrats account for more than 61 percent of the primary vote). Instead, each hopeful would have to figure out how to appeal to a California electorate among whom nearly 45 percent of registered voters identify as Democrat and 22.5 percent as independent.\n\nWill Democrats campaign across California as Newsom did in 2018, offering a menu of unattainable progressive ideals? Will a viable Democratic candidate dare to say that their party has contributed to California's woes, including chronic homelessness, educational inequality and fiscal recklessness?\n\nPerhaps the latter is only so much California dreaming. Still, in the state that's home to the country's entertainment capital, it would be nice to see a plot twist.", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/11/11/california-governor-democrats-newsom-record/"}

(Jabin Botsford/The Washingto...", "content": "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-New York) blasted the eight Democrats who voted with Senate Republicans to advance a bill that would end the government shutdown. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nThe fury at eight Democratic-aligned senators who voted with Republicans to end the longest-ever government shutdown highlights the dramatic shift in the Democratic Party less than a year into President Donald Trump's second term, as voters and lawmakers argue the party needs to adopt more ruthless tactics to counter the president and claw its way back to power.\n\nThe reaction to the two votes on Sunday and Monday, which provide a pathway for the government to reopen after more than 40 days, was fierce. Rep. Ro Khanna (D-California) called for Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer to be replaced, suggesting he was an ineffective leader even though Schumer opposed the government funding measure. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries blasted the eight senators and said House Democrats would not support a government funding bill that did not include the health care measures the party has demanded. Democratic advocacy groups, politically vulnerable lawmakers, potential 2028 presidential candidates and voters all followed suit, lambasting those in their party they saw as caving.\n\nThe desire for Democrats to hold firm despite the pain inflicted by the shutdown -- even though the party's prior posture was that shutdowns were self-destructive -- was the latest example of a party that has decided it must adopt an altogether different playbook given Trump's willingness to resort to unprecedented measures to consolidate and maintain power. Rather than try to uphold norms as Trump shatters them, they have instead decided to fight Trump with tactics they previously disdained -- and excoriated those who have stood in the way, whether on redistricting or standing by candidates with problematic pasts.\n\n\"Early on, there were not enough members of Congress who recognized the magnitude of the threat Donald Trump poses to our democracy and constitution,\" said Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Maryland), who opposed the government funding deal. \"That has changed.\"\n\nVan Hollen said there were a small number of senators in what he dubbed the \"no business as usual caucus\" at the beginning of Trump's term that has since grown dramatically in response to energy from the party's base.\n\n\"The lesson is there is power in unity and in members of Congress working in partnership with the grassroots community,\" he said. \"This is why so many people are feeling let down at this moment, because that unity was important.\"\n\nBeyond the shutdown, the party has also shifted course on redrawing congressional maps, retreating from past attempts to rely on independent commissions as Democrats fight a wave of Republican-led efforts to alter maps in conservative-led states. California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) led a successful campaign to redraw his state's map and won voter approval in a special election last week, prompting Democrats in states such as Virginia, Illinois and Maryland to consider similar efforts.\n\nOn Monday, while traveling to a conference in Brazil, Newsom chided Democrats in the Senate who broke ranks on the shutdown, arguing that they foolishly \"decided that we're playing by the old set of rules\" and had not adjusted to the new reality.\n\nThere have been other signs of Democrats' new posture. Once quick to demand their politicians step aside after scandal, Democrats have been standing by candidates who have had problematic past statements surface -- with some early success. Jay Jones, whose violent text messages from years ago were leaked just weeks before Election Day, overcame the controversy to become Virginia's next attorney general, an office he hopes to use as a bulwark against the Trump administration.\n\nSwing Left, a liberal group that was born out of Democratic anger at Trump's 2016 election, decided to invest considerable money and time into his campaign after the leaked texts -- in which he nonchalantly mused about shooting the former GOP speaker of the House of Delegates in the head -- emerged. The decision-making process was brief, said Yasmin Radjy, the group's executive director, even if Jones's comments were \"indefensible.\"\n\n\"We just can't play by the old playbook of receding to the background, even when candidates have the warts that candidates have. Winning power is about math, and we have to win majorities,\" said Radjy. \"We need to be more ruthlessly pragmatic than we ever have been, even when that's maybe uncomfortable.\"\n\nLikewise, Graham Platner, a liberal oysterman and veteran, has insisted he will still run for one of Maine's two Senate seats despite only recently altering a tattoo on his chest resembling a Nazi symbol and problematic Reddit posts from years ago in which he downplayed sexual assault in the military and described himself as a communist. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont) has maintained his support for Platner, arguing that there has been a growing opposition to \"cancel culture\" and a realization that people cannot be solely judged by comments or actions from years ago.\n\n\"Many Democrats understand now, after the presidential election, that simply defending the status quo is not good enough,\" Sanders said in an interview. \"The Democratic Party has been perceived to be weak, to not stand up and fight, so I think that is one of the changes that we are seeing.\"\n\nKelli Musick of Portland, Maine, said she was drawn to Platner as soon as she saw his campaign launch video because he came across as authentic and renewed her sense of hope. Weeks later, she was upset when she learned about his tattoo and his social media posts. After listening to his apologies and explanations, she determined he had taken responsibility for his mistakes and grown as a person, said Musick, 32, a caseworker with the state health department.\n\nMusick said she was outraged in 2017 by the sexual misconduct allegations that prompted Sen. Al Franken (D-Minnesota) to quit the Senate. But the political stakes of today are much higher, she said, noting Trump has flirted with running for a third term despite the constitutional limit.\n\n\"We're a far cry from the days of Dijon mustard and tan suits,\" she said, referring to episodes from Barack Obama's presidency in which he was mocked for his choice of condiment and attire. \"So I think, yes, certainly we are more willing to let things slide than previously.\"\n\nThis new posture is not only invigorating the party's base, but also candidates who are running to change the party from within. State Sen. Mallory McMorrow, who is running for Michigan's open Senate seat, said she can feel a \"renewed energy to reshape\" a Democratic Party that has, at times, allowed Republicans to play by a separate set of rules.\n\n\"There is too much nostalgia for the way that things were, and the only way to get back to the way that things were is to treat this moment very differently,\" McMorrow said. \"You have to fight fire with fire, you have to make sure that Democrats hold power to make the changes that are going to be necessary.\"\n\nNeera Tanden, the head of the liberal think tank Center for American Progress, said Trump's reelection marked an inflection point for the Democratic Party that made it \"hard to say that some things are just unacceptable in politics these days.\"\n\n\"That's a big shift from, 'When they go low, we go high.' And it's even a shift from 2020 because the ethos of President Biden was like, 'I'm going to restore the soul of the nation,'\" said Tanden, a former senior official under Biden. \"The real problem is that if only one side is following the norms of decorum, then the other side is basically benefiting from the weakness of Democrats.\"\n\nFormer first lady Michelle Obama, who originated the phrase \"when they go low, we go high\" during her speech to the Democratic National Convention in 2016, has even acknowledged that the dynamic has shifted.\n\n\"The true answer is, no,\" she said on the \"All The Smoke\" podcast in August when asked if \"we still have to go high.\"\n\n\"Going high is about being strategic, and that is really my point,\" Obama said.\n\nThere are few Democrats arguing the party should be abiding by previous rules and norms. But those who do are quickly assailed as out of touch and complicit in what some have characterized as Trump's slide into authoritarianism.\n\nIn Maryland, Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) has refused to advance any mid-cycle redistricting effort even as its Democratic governor, Wes Moore, insists Maryland will move ahead in drawing new maps. Ferguson has opposed the effort for a list of philosophical reasons and a core pragmatic one: he believes Maryland courts would ultimately overturn the map and potentially cost Democrats more seats than redistricting would gain.\n\nHe said the risk of losing power -- at the cost of compromising good-governance values -- will ultimately backfire, arguing Democrats need to consider what the party will stand for in the long term.\n\n\"To the degree that it is within the laws and constitutions of the state, yes, we should be thinking of different tactics to win,\" Ferguson said in an interview. \"Where I do not think we should go is the lawlessness that we've seen. And I think this is a question for each individual elected official: Where is the line?\"\n\nThe state's Democratic governor, Wes Moore, struck a different tone. \"Maryland will not just sit on its hands while Donald Trump continues to pick and choose which states have fair maps and which states don't when we know he's just trying to rig the rules,\" Moore said on a YouTube show last week.\n\nWhen Ferguson wrote on X that last week's elections showed \"we don't need to rig the system to win,\" dozens of Democrats argued that should not be the takeaway.\n\n\"Get our victory in Virginia out of your mouth while you echo MAGA talking points,\" Virginia state Sen. Louise Lucas wrote on X. \"Grow a pair and stand up to this President. This is just [embarrassing].\"\n\nErin Cox contributed to this report.", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/11/11/democrats-shutdown-trump/"}

But eight members of his caucus - enough to advance the measure - broke ranks, arguing that President Donald Trump's administration was taking advantage of the situation to undermine needed programs. That fracture led to fresh criticism of the 74-year-old lawmaker's leadership.\n\n\"Leadership is about changing and adapting when there is real need, and unless we hear that, we will fail to meet the moment,\" first-term Senator Elissa Slotkin of Michigan said in a statement.\n\nWhile the criticism from the left was scathing, only the 45 Democratic senators and two independents who caucus with them have a say on whether Schumer can be removed from his leadership role or defeated in a leadership election that would be held following the November 2026 elections. Schumer is not up for re-election to another six-year Senate term until 2028.\n\nProgressives took a much harsher tone, with the advocacy group \"Our Revolution\" urging Schumer to resign as minority leader, as did Representative Ro Khanna of California, who said in a statement, \"Senator Schumer is no longer effective and should be replaced.\"\n\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom, seen as a contender for the 2028 Democratic presidential nomination, on social media called the compromise \"Pathetic. This isn't a deal. It's surrender.\"\n\nDAYS AFTER ELECTION VICTORIES\n\nThe blowback came less than a week after the party celebrated wins in a handful of elections last Tuesday, which saw moderate Democrats clinch dominating wins for governor in Virginia and New Jersey and a democratic socialist elected mayor of New York City. It also reflected the frustrations of a party largely boxed out of power in Washington, where Trump's Republicans control the House of Representatives and Senate.\n\nSchumer, in a speech to the Senate on Monday, said that Democrats succeeded in putting healthcare \"at the forefront of people's minds.\"\n\n\"The American people will not forget Donald Trump's cruelty and heartlessness over the past six weeks,\" he added.\n\nJon Cowan, president of the centrist think tank Third Way, said in an interview that the attacks on Schumer coming from the left will likely subside.\n\n\"Every Democrat and allied interest group is going to end their circular firing squad and aim all of their ammunition at Trump\" and at congressional Republicans who are vulnerable to losing their seats in next year's elections, he said.\n\n'BRUTAL BLOW'\n\nSome of Schumer's fellow Senate Democrats tried to refocus the anger on Trump.\n\nWhile calling the Sunday vote to move forward on reopening the government - a process that will take several days at least - a \"brutal blow,\" Senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon added, \"The real villain is Trump and congressional Republicans.\"\n\nStill there has been pressure building in the party for years for aging leaders to step aside, clearing the way for new blood, particularly after concerns about former President Joe Biden's age played a role in the party's losses in the 2024 election that saw Trump returned to power. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in 2022 gave up her leadership role and last week said she would not seek re-election, bringing her career to a close.\n\nFor months now, Democrats have been fighting to stop significant increases in health insurance premiums with the December 31 expiration of an Affordable Care Act subsidy. Congressional Democrats had refused to allow a government funding bill to pass until their demands for renewing the subsidy were met.\n\n\"Caving on a deal that doesn't fix health care is, and always has been, a giant betrayal of the American people,\" said former Congressional Progressive Caucus Chair Pramila Jayapal of Washington State.\n\nNotably, of the eight Democrats voting yes on Sunday, six are not up for re-election next year and two are retiring, including No. 2 Senate Democrat Dick Durbin.\n\nDurbin said Schumer was disappointed when he told the Democratic leader he would vote to end the shutdown.\n\n\"He was a gentleman about it, though he disagreed with me,\" Durbin told reporters. \"I think our friendship is still intact.\"\n\nThe deal faced criticism even from party moderates - including New Jersey Governor-elect Mikie Sherrill, who called it \"malpractice.\"\n\n\"Last week we won with a broad coalition after laying out a plan that takes bold action on costs, despite political pressure and people saying it couldn't be done,\" Sherrill said in a statement. \"Voters made it clear: the American people want leadership with a backbone.\"\n\n(This story has been corrected to say that New Jersey Governor-elect is Mikie Sherrill, not Mike Sherrill, in paragraph 21)\n\nReporting by Nolan D.

Earlier in the year, Chuck Schumer, the Minority Leader, had rallied enough votes to keep the government open and faced a furious backlash from the Democratic base; capitulating again would have been politically intolerable. As the Times columnist Ezra Klein observed, a shutdown also presented the Democrats with an opportunity to focus public attention on President Donald Trump's corruption, turning what had been a \"diffuse crisis\" into an \"acute\" one. In the end, the Democrats mostly oriented their demands toward health care -- above all, the renewal of expiring Obamacare subsidies -- as opposed to, say, prioritizing more abstract ultimatums related to creeping authoritarianism. (Klein suggested that the two could be linked.) The health-care dispute looked like typical grist for a shutdown, insofar as such events can be considered typical at all: before the current one, there had only been three of significant length. On those occasions, the party forcing the issue wilted under public pressure without getting what it came for, as the other side pointed to the intensifying costs for federal workers and average Americans.\n\nWhat happened next, this time, was strange, and not uniformly validating for the Democrats' strategy. The shutdown became a big news story, of course, but didn't concentrate attention to the degree one might have expected -- in no small part because, in Trump's Washington, there's always something else going on. Not enough pressure mounted on the Democrats to give in, either. Republicans tried to make them take difficult votes to reopen the government, but those attempts never really cut through; as one G.O.P. strategist noted, the mainstream press lacked its past power to push a unified narrative that one side or the other appeared to be winning. To the extent that the press did do this, the answer was that it was good for Democrats: polls mostly showed them getting blamed less than Trump and other Republicans, whose ability, at least in principle, to drum up sympathy for federal workers was hamstrung by the Administration using the shutdown as a pretext to fire a bunch of them. Last week, Democrats swept the board in off-year elections across the country. Whatever role the shutdown played in those results, Trump put it center stage by declaring that the Republicans' handling of it was a major reason for their bad night, then loudly urged his party's majority in the Senate to nix the filibuster, a move that would have enabled them to reopen the government unilaterally. Democrats appeared to have all the momentum.\n\nThen, on Sunday, eight moderate members of the Democratic caucus in the Senate voted with Republicans to move forward with a plan that would reopen the government, circumventing the filibuster; under the terms of the deal, agencies and programs will be funded through January (and in some cases beyond), laid-off federal workers will be reinstated, and the Obamacare subsidies will come up for a separate vote next month, but its success is far from guaranteed. Cue more furious backlash from the Democratic base. When I logged onto Bluesky this morning, I saw the eight Senators being referred to as \"Cavers,\" \"Turncoats,\" \"Chickenshits,\" and \"Fuckers\" (all in one post); as \"QUISLINGS\"; and as \"Pathetic.\" The last of those darts was fired (initially on X) by Gavin Newsom, the governor of California, who is a resistance darling of the moment after forcing through new, Democrat-friendly congressional maps in his state last week. Other Party bigwigs expressed disappointment, too, from the progressives Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren to the milquetoast Democratic National Committee leader Ken Martin. A group of Democrats ended the shutdown \"in return for -- if we're being honest -- very little,\" Klein wrote, in the Times. \"If I were in the Senate, I wouldn't vote for this compromise.\"", "url": "https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-lede/did-democrats-win-the-shutdown-after-all"}

Climate Change Executive Secretary Simon Stiell told delegates from more than 190 countries attending.\n\nHe said three decades of U.N. climate talks had helped to bend the curve in projected warming downward, \"because of what was agreed in halls like this, with governments legislating, and markets responding. But I am not sugar-coating it. We have so much more work to do.\"\n\nA new U.N. analysis of countries' emissions-cutting plans estimated that global greenhouse gases would decrease 12% by 2035 from 2019 levels, improving on an earlier estimate of 10% published last month.\n\nThe new figure takes into account the most recent pledges, including from China and the EU, but was still short of the 60% emissions drop needed by 2035 to limit global warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial temperatures - the threshold beyond which scientists say climate change would unleash far more severe impacts.\n\nBrazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva warned against interests trying to obscure the dangers of climate change.\n\n\"They attack the institutions, the science, the universities,\" he said. \"It's time to impose another defeat to denialists.\"\n\nThe world's biggest historical emitter of greenhouse gases - the United States - opted to skip the summit; U.S. President Donald Trump falsely asserts that climate change is a hoax.\n\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom and New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham were expected in Belem on Tuesday.\n\n\"What the hell is going on here?\" Newsom said of the U.S. government's absence from the talks, addressing a global investors summit held on Monday in Sao Paulo.\n\n\"We're in Brazil, one of our great trading partners, one of the world's great democracies. I mean, hell, home to all the rare earth metals we need. This is the country we should be engaging with instead of giving the middle finger with 50% tariffs,\" Newsom said, referring to duties imposed by the Trump administration.\n\nCOP30 President Andre Correa do Lago told a news conference: \"I think that the absence of the U.S. ... has opened some space for the world to see what developing countries are doing.\"\n\nGermany said European countries would push for commitments to rein in fossil fuel use - a goal promoted by Lula.\n\n\"We will advocate for something strong,\" German Vice Minister Jochen Flasbarth told Reuters. \"We don't want to go the same way of President Trump and accuse others of being wrong. We want to listen.\"\n\nWARNING SIGNS\n\nCountries were joined by Indigenous leaders, who arrived on Sunday by boat after traveling some 3,000 km (1,864 miles) from the Andes. They are demanding more say in how their territories are managed as climate change escalates and industries such as mining, logging and oil drilling push deeper into forests.\n\n\"We want to make sure that they don't keep promising, that they will start protecting, because we as Indigenous people are the ones who suffer from these impacts of climate change,\" said Pablo Inuma Flores, an Indigenous leader from Peru.\n\nScientists at dozens of universities and international science institutions sounded an alarm over the world's thawing glaciers, ice sheets, and other frozen spaces.\n\n\"The cryosphere is destabilizing at an alarming pace,\" the groups said in a letter to COP30 published on Monday. \"Geopolitical tensions or short-term national interests must not overshadow COP30.

It was unrealistic for Hamas to expect a ceasefire, he wrote, as long as they were holding hostages.\n\nSoon afterward, a former student called for his firing. A note taped outside the door of his Adams County, Colorado, classroom contained his wife's name and their home address. And a sticker that appeared on his chair read: \"Israel is committing genocide in Gaza.\"\n\nThe reaction startled Mr. Hirsch, the only Jewish teacher in his school building. For the first time in his 14-year career, he considered quitting. He stayed and joined an educators' advocacy network created by the Anti-Defamation League, a way he saw to make schools more inclusive of diverse viewpoints.\n\n\"I've been a teacher and tried to keep my focus on being the best teacher I could,\" he said.\n\nTensions over the Israel-Hamas war have spilled into schools around the U.S., with advocates reporting a rise in antisemitic harassment since the 2023 surprise attack on Israel. While some argue school leaders have failed to take the threat seriously, others warn criticism of Israel and the military campaign in Gaza are interpreted too often as hate speech.\n\nThe Trump administration has not punished school systems the way it has hit colleges accused of tolerating antisemitism, but schools are still facing pressure to respond more aggressively. Several states have pressed for new vigilance, including legislation that critics say would stifle free speech.\n\nLawmakers in Texas, Arkansas, Oklahoma and Tennessee have passed measures to increase school accountability for complaints of antisemitism, and a law signed by California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, will provide training to identify and prevent antisemitism in schools.\n\nIn Arizona, the Democratic governor vetoed a bill on how to deal with reports of antisemitism in schools, calling it an attack on educators.\n\nMany of the measures, including one signed by Oklahoma's Republican governor, call for adoption of a definition of antisemitism that casts certain criticism of Israel as hate speech.\n\n\"These bills make it clear that Oklahoma stands with our Jewish communities and will not tolerate hatred disguised as political discourse,\" said Kristen Thompson, a Republican state senator in Oklahoma who wrote the legislation.\n\nDozens of states have adopted the definition promoted by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance, which is also recognized by the State Department. It lists 11 examples of antisemitic conduct, such as applying \"double standards\" to Israel or comparing the country's policies to Nazism.\n\nWhile supporters of this definition of antisemitism say it is necessary to combat evolving forms of Jewish hate, civil liberties groups warn it suppresses pro-Palestinian speech.\n\nThe Trump administration has leveraged antisemitism investigations in its efforts to reshape higher education, suspending billions of dollars in federal funding to Harvard, Columbia and other universities over allegations they tolerated hate speech, especially during protests over the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nThe White House has not gotten as involved at the K-12 level. At congressional hearings, House Republicans have taken some large school systems to task over their handling of antisemitism, but the administration largely has left it to the Education Department's Office for Civil Rights to address complaints.\n\nIn one of the cases under investigation, a complaint described students at the Berkeley Unified School District in California asking Jewish classmates what \"their number is,\" referring to numbers tattooed on Jews during the Holocaust. It also said teachers made antisemitic comments and led walkouts that praised Hamas.\n\nThe district did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn another California case, the family of a 14-year-old girl filed a federal lawsuit last year alleging she had to leave University Preparatory Academy, a charter school in San Jose, in 2023 because of antisemitic bullying. After the Hamas attack, she said students called her names, including \"terrorist.\" The California Department of Education and the school said they could not comment on pending litigation.\n\nNationwide, the ADL recorded 860 antisemitic incidents in non-Jewish schools last year, ranging from name-calling and swastikas etched on lockers to antisemitic materials being taught in classrooms. The number was down from more than 1,100 recorded in 2023, but well above numbers in prior years, according to the ADL.\n\nA Massachusetts state commission formed last year to combat antisemitism found it was a \"pervasive and escalating problem\" in schools.\n\nAt one meeting, a commission co-chair, Democratic state Rep. Simon Cataldo, said the Massachusetts Teachers Association was sharing antisemitic resources with teachers, including a kindergarten workbook that describes Zionists as \"bullies\" and an image of a Star of David made of dollar bills. The union said those were singled out among hundreds of images in art and posters about Palestinians, and links to those materials were removed.\n\nThe union said it has engaged in efforts to confront increases in antisemitism and Islamophobia and accused the commission of \"offensive political theater.\"\n\n\"Those who manipulate antisemitism to achieve political objectives -- such as undermining labor unions and public educators -- are following the lead of the Trump administration,\" the union said in a statement.", "url": "https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2025/nov/10/antisemitism-schools-given-scrutiny-lawmakers-states-across-country/"}

Gavin Newsom said. \"There's no way to defend this,\" Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut argued. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, said \"it would be a policy and political disaster for the Democrats to cave.\"\n\nThe reaction is a reflection of the frustration among many Democrats, particularly progressives, who had urged their party to keep fighting after the strong Democratic performance in last week's elections. But the shutdown's ongoing toll was ultimately too steep for some of the party's more moderate members to stomach.\n\nThe resulting deal has exposed fault lines within the party that could reverberate over the months ahead and frame the party's internal debate heading into the primaries for next year's midterm elections. And it has led some congressional Democrats and progressive groups to call for Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer to step down, despite his personal opposition to the agreement.\n\nThe Democrats who broke ranks and voted to move forward had been engaged in bipartisan talks to find an off-ramp for several weeks. Led by Sens. Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire and Sen. Angus King of Maine, the deal they struck secured a vote next month on Affordable Care Act tax credits that Democrats have sought to extend.\n\nBut the agreement doesn't guarantee an outcome of the vote, and most Republicans have made no secret of their opposition to extending the subsidies. Even if some version of an extension does pass the Senate, House Speaker Mike Johnson has not committed to bringing it up in the House.\n\n\"I understand the frustration and obviously I didn't agree with that decision,\" Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii told reporters Monday. \"But what we have to make sure of now is that the health care fight lives outside of the appropriations process and doesn't depend entirely on the government being shut down. So now we have a fight in front of us.\"\n\nThe Senate Democrats who crossed the aisle have pointed to other provisions in the agreement to argue it was worthy of support. A new version of the funding bill would reverse all government layoffs that occurred during the shutdown and prevent them for a limited time going forward. The deal would also restore funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program at higher levels, and pave the way for a bipartisan appropriations process on other spending bills.\n\nThe eight Democrats also argued there is value in putting Republicans on the record with a vote on the health insurance issue, which Democrats have thrust into the spotlight with the shutdown fight. The moderates viewed the deal -- after Republicans leaders refused to budge -- as the best possible offer they could secure.\n\n\"We stood up to President Trump for 40 days,\" Shaheen said on \"CBS Mornings\" Monday.\n\nThe New Hampshire Democrat defended the move to cross the aisle despite the lack of tangible progress on health care, saying \"we're going to be able to continue fighting on that issue because of the agreement that we struck with the Senate majority.\"\n\n\"But we're also going to end the suffering of millions of Americans,\" she said, pointing to the millions of people who have not received food assistance, and the federal employees and air traffic controllers who have not received paychecks.\n\n\"And we're going to live to fight another day -- and that's what we need to keep people focused on,\" Shaheen said. \"It's not the Democrats who broke ranks who are the issue here.\"\n\nCritics are also directing ire at the party's leaders for allowing the defections. Almost immediately after the details of the deal came to light, Schumer faced calls for his replacement as the party's leader in the upper chamber.\n\n\"It's time for him to be replaced. He is not meeting the moment. He's out of touch with where the party's base is,\" Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California told CBS News.\n\n\"Tonight is another example of why we need new leadership. If [Schumer] were an effective leader, he would have united his caucus to vote 'No' tonight and hold the line on healthcare,\" wrote Rep. Seth Moulton of Massachusetts, a Democrat who is running for Senate.\n\nFor his part, Schumer outlined his own opposition to advancing the measure to fund the government Sunday, railing against Republicans for refusing to engage with Democrats on the health care issue during the shutdown while pledging to continue the fight.\n\n\"I must vote no -- this health care crisis is so severe, so urgent, so devastating for families back home that I cannot in good faith support this CR that fails to address the health care crisis,\" Schumer said on the Senate floor ahead of the vote.\n\nLate last week, Schumer said Democrats would reopen the government if Republicans agreed to a one-year extension of the health insurance tax credits. But Republicans swiftly rejected the offer.\n\nThe New York Democrat faced a windstorm of criticism during the last funding fight in March, when he voted to advance a GOP-led continuing resolution. This time around, Schumer made a point of putting up a fight, engaging early with Republicans and the White House to negotiate a deal on health care while keeping his caucus largely unified against the GOP's funding plan for almost two months. Still, since the beginning it appeared unlikely that the leader would make it out of the funding fight completely unscathed.", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/texas/news/government-shutdown-deal-senate-democrats-health-care/"}

Instead, the deal promises a vote on health care subsidies in the coming weeks -- something Senate Majority Leader John Thune had already offered as part of a deal over a month ago.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders, an independent who has been a vocal leader in the fight to extend health care subsidies, posted a video on X Sunday night captioned: \"Tonight was a very bad night.\"\n\n\"This was a very, very bad vote,\" Sanders said, adding that the deal \"raises health care premiums for over 20 million Americans\" and \"paves the way for 15 million people to be thrown off of Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act.\"\n\nSanders said last week's elections -- in which Democrats across the country won by historic margins -- shows that \"the American people want us to stand up to Trumpism, to his war against working-class people, to his authoritarianism.

JB Pritzker wrote in a post on X that instead of a deal, it's an \"empty promise,\" and California Gov. Gavin Newsom curtly called the move by Senate Democrats \"pathetic.\"\n\nHouse Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries on Monday said the party will continue to fight for health care, adding that the Democratic senators who voted for the GOP plan will have to defend their votes.\n\n\"With respect to senators ... they are going to have to explain themselves,\" Jeffries said during a news conference Monday.\n\nAnd as a consequence, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, despite voting no on the Republican spending bill, has faced calls from Democrats in Congress to step down from Senate leadership over his failure to keep members of his party in line.\n\nSome Democrats, such as progressive Rep. Rho Khanna, are calling for Schumer to walk away from the job entirely.\n\n\"Senator Schumer is no longer effective and should be replaced,\" Khanna wrote on X Sunday night. \"If you can't lead the fight to stop healthcare premiums from skyrocketing for Americans, what will you fight for?\"\n\nDemocratic Rep. Mike Levin wrote on X on Monday that \"Chuck Schumer has not met this moment and Senate Democrats would be wise to move on from his leadership.\"\n\nSchumer, meanwhile, has vowed to \"keep fighting\" in the battle for health care.\n\nThe rouge Democrats defended their yes vote Sunday night, claiming that Republicans would now work with them on the issue of health care.\n\n\"After weeks of bipartisan conversations, I voted today to reopen the government so that we can get back to the work of helping families. This agreement funds SNAP and food assistance programs ensures that law enforcement, air traffic controllers and other federal workers get paid, reverses the president's recent reckless layoffs and prevents them from happening in the future, and crucially, gives Congress a clear path forward to protecting people's health care,\" Hassan said Sunday.\n\n\"And if [a deal on health care] is not successful, then shame on the Republican party and shame on Donald Trump. But the American people will see who stands with them on health care and who does not, and that will be the platform of the next stage of the fight,\" added Shaheen.\n\nOn Capitol Hill Sunday night, Kaine, Hassan, Shaheen, Cortez Masto and King stressed there is still a critical need for ACA tax credits, but that the impact of the government shutdown was becoming too dire. Additionally, the group said the Republicans were \"clear\" in their refusal to negotiate with Democrats over health care while the government remained closed.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/bad-night-democrats-face-blowback-party-shutdown-deal/story?id=127379532"}

Elissa Slotkin from the swing state of Michigan also reaffirmed her decision to vote \"no\" on a deal to reopen the government: \"Since July, I have been clear: to earn my vote, Republicans would have to do something to bring down the cost of health care for working and middle-class Michiganders. The promise of a vote in over a month does not meet that threshold.\"", "url": "https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/democrat-presidential-hopefuls-blast-shutdown-deal-rcna243023"}

Riffing and smiling through the hourlong conversation, Mr. Mamdani hit his talking points about affordability and housing with ease. When the hosts teased him about his inability to bench press 135 pounds, he didn't flinch.\n\n\"Next year, 136,\" Mr. Mamdani, 34, said as Mr. Schulz broke into laughter. \"Promises I can keep.\"\n\nThe men's playful banter on \"Flagrant,\" which drew 1.9 million views, might not have seemed political, but in fact it was a subtextual kind of litmus test, birthed from a new media landscape, with very real political consequences.\n\nThat test, put in simple terms, is this: Can you hang with the boys?\n\nA year ago, President Trump seemed to hold his own when he, too, appeared on \"Flagrant,\" as well as on shows hosted by big names, like Theo Von and Mr. Rogan. The approach helped him draw young men away from Democrats by wide margin, into a winning coalition.\n\nMr. Mamdani forged a similar path through this nebulous online territory, where authenticity is a currency impossible to counterfeit.\n\nIt appears to have won him a foothold with young men over his opponents, Mr. Cuomo and the Republican nominee, Curtis Sliwa. A CNN exit poll showed Mr. Mamdani dominating the category, earning 65 percent of the votes by men 18 to 29.\n\nOver the course of his campaign, Mr. Mamdani made more than 30 appearances across the digital wilderness of podcasts, livestreams, and YouTube shows that have come to be the primary delivery mechanism of news and current events for Americans under the age of 30, -- and which Democrats have historically avoided.\n\n\"Places where people are used to hot takes and not politicians -- to show that Zohran was the kind of candidate who could talk about housing and Arsenal in the same breath\" said Zara Rahim, a special adviser to the Mamdani campaign who helped shape its new media strategy.\n\nNo podcast was deemed off limits. Mr. Mamdani had even agreed to appear on Joe Rogan's podcast, but scheduling conflicts got in the way, according to a spokesperson for the campaign.\n\nVenturing into the heart of masculinist online media was once considered more of a liability. When Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont appeared on Mr. Rogan's podcast in 2020, it reinforced for some his often derided \"Bernie Bro\" appeal, and many liberals were aghast when Mr. Sanders did not denounce Mr. Rogan's endorsement of him.\n\nOne presidential election cycle later, former Vice President Kamala Harris faced criticism for not appearing on Mr. Rogan's show. The decision became a hotly debated flashpoint in the post-mortems about the Democratic Party's struggles to reach young men and engage them in online spaces.\n\nThe fixes, proposed by party strategists, have hinged on minting a \"Joe Rogan of the left\" or building large-language models to study the vocal patterns of male speakers. Democrats have also prodded donors to chip in tens of millions of dollars to fund progressive-leaning creators and content incubators.\n\nSome prominent Democrats, like the former transportation secretary, Pete Buttigieg, and Representative Ro Khanna of California,have tiptoed into this fraught terrain. Gov. Gavin Newsom of California has gone as far as to start his own podcast, \"This Is Gavin Newsom,\" centered on tough conversations with conservative personalities.\n\nPlaying across the political spectrum, Mr. Mamdani dropped in on the center left -- chatting with Sam Seder on \"The Majority Report\" -- the center right -- on \"FYPod\" with Tim Miller -- and beyond, to the nihilistic, and sometimes crass and clubby boys zones staked out by the \"bros\" on the \"Flagrant\" podcast.\n\nHe also appeared on women-led shows, like \"I've Had It,\" hosted by Jennifer Welch and Angie Sullivan, and Katie Couric's podcast.\n\n\"He's figured out a way to banter with the boys and not punch down,\" Charlie Sabgir, research and strategy lead for the Young Men Research Project, a nonpartisan organization, said of Mr. Mamdani.\n\nBack in early April, Mr. Mamdani showed the leftist Twitch streamer Hasan Piker around his home neighborhood of Astoria, Queens. Sitting down at Yemeni coffee shops and popping by Bangladeshi restaurants, the two discussed the candidate's then-fledgling campaign for the better part of three hours while tens of thousands of Mr. Piker's viewers tuned in.\n\n\"Zohran's a good hang,\" Mr. Piker said in an interview. \"He's just a dude, and it's good to be a dude sometimes.\"\n\nHe added: \"And I think you can see that even when he talks with people who are his ideological opposites.\"\n\nMr. Mamdani also made an impression on James Harris, a co-host of the men's wear podcast \"Throwing Fits,\" with whom Mr. Mamdani recorded an episode after his first mayoral debate in June.\n\n\"It felt like this guy is who he is, this is what he believes in,\" Mr. Harris said, reflecting on Mr. Mamdani's tendency to return to his talking points. \"But he also wants to have a fun conversation and is down to clown.\"\n\nMr. Mamdani's podcast appearances have not been entirely without controversy. Onstage during last month's mayoral debate, Mr. Cuomo attacked Mr. Mamdani over his association with Mr. Piker, who had made provocative comments about Sept. 11. But the attacks failed to resonate with the young men tuning in to Mr. Mamdani's larger message.\n\nSucceeding in these online spaces, experts said, can be more complicated than playing the part of the cool politician, or simply making campaign stops in the manosphere.\n\nMr. Cuomo, for instance, also sat down with some of the loudest voices in the manosphere, appearing on Logan Paul's \"Impaulsive Podcast\" in the final weeks of the election.\n\nThe episode, to date, has just over 100,000 views, paltry by Mr. Paul's standards, and received a barrage of negative comments.\n\nMr. Sabgir contrasted Mr. Cuomo's method with Mr. Mamdani's, noting the latter's ability to put forward an \"optimistic\" and \"joyful\" message. Something, he thinks, Gen Z is looking for most.\n\n\"Young men are generally disenchanted with both parties,\" Mr. Sabigr said. \"But Mr. Mamdani tried to win them back, especially Trump voters, by running for something as opposed to against something.\"", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/10/style/zohran-mamdani-podcasts-manosphere.html"}

Hours later, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent appeared to push back on the idea. Economists have warned that such moves could stoke inflation.\n\nBeijing suspends export controls on five critical minerals for a year. China's move eases the flow of the materials, which are crucial to manufacturing certain semiconductors, batteries and nuclear reactors. The resumption of the exports was a key concession in trade talks last month with U.S. officials.\n\nOpenAI argues for a tax break for data centers. In a recent open letter to the Trump administration, the artificial intelligence giant said the government should consider extending a tax credit intended for the U.S. semiconductor sector \"to accelerate the A.I. build\" in the country. But last week Sam Altman, OpenAI's C.E.O., said the company did \"not have or want government guarantees for OpenAI datacenters.\"\n\nThe task forces\n\nThe DealBook Summit will also feature a series of task force conversations with experts, stakeholders and leaders on topics shaping the world at large.\n\nWhile the task forces are not open to attendees, watch for a special section in The Times and tune in to the DealBook podcast in the days after the summit for coverage of the discussions.\n\nThis year's task forces include:\n\nThe Global Re-Order, moderated by Nicholas Kristof, Times Opinion columnist, and featuring:\n\n* Ehud Barak, former prime minister of Israel\n\n* Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware and member of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations\n\n* Mark Esper, former U.S. secretary of defense\n\n* Avril Haines, former U.S. director of national intelligence\n\n* David Petraeus, partner and chairman of the Global Institute; chairman of KKR Middle East Global Institute New York and former director of the C.I.A.\n\n* Fareed Zakaria, host of \"Fareed Zakaria GPS\" on CNN\n\nThe Education of Higher Education, moderated by Jodi Kantor, Times investigative reporter and featuring:\n\n* Carmen Twillie Ambar, president of Oberlin College and Conservatory\n\n* Sian Leah Beilock, president of Dartmouth College\n\n* Ron Daniels, president of Johns Hopkins University\n\n* Daniel Diermeier, chancellor of Vanderbilt University\n\n* James Harris, president of the University of San Diego\n\n* John King, chancellor of the State University of New York and former U.S. secretary of education\n\n* Jonathan Levin, president of Stanford University\n\nThe New Rules for Leadership, moderated by David Brooks, Times Opinion columnist, and featuring:\n\n* Alex Chriss, C.E.O. of PayPal\n\n* Beth Ford, C.E.O. of Land O'Lakes\n\n* Bob Jordan, C.E.O. of Southwest Airlines\n\n* Ynon Kreiz, chairman and C.E.O. of Mattel\n\n* Pete Nordstrom, co-C.E.O. of Nordstrom\n\n* Emma Walmsley, C.E.O. of GlaxoSmithKline\n\nJournalism, Interrupted, moderated by Michael Barbaro, Times journalist and co-host of \"The Daily,\" and featuring:\n\n* Charlamagne Tha God, co-host of \"The Breakfast Club\" and co-founder of The Black Effect\n\n* Jon Favreau, co-founder of Crooked Media and host of \"Pod Save America\"\n\n* Amna Nawaz, co-anchor and co-managing editor of PBS \"NewsHour\"\n\n* David Remnick, editor of The New Yorker and host of \"The New Yorker Radio Hour\"\n\n* Stephanie Ruhle, host of MSNBC's \"The 11th Hour With Stephanie Ruhle\"\n\n* Andrew Schulz, host of the podcasts \"The Brilliant Idiots\" and \"Flagrant\" with Akaash Singh\n\n* Ben Shapiro, co-founder of The Daily Wire and host of \"The Ben Shapiro Show\"\n\nThe groundbreakers\n\nThe summit will also feature innovators, newsmakers and trailblazers from the public and private sectors, who will each lead a table at a lunchtime discussion focused on the critical issues of the day.\n\nThis year's groundbreakers include:\n\n* Stacey Abrams, author, entrepreneur and political leader\n\n* Bill Anderson, C.E.O. of Bayer\n\n* Mark Barrocas, C.E.O. of SharkNinja\n\n* Halle Berry, founder of Respin, filmmaker and advocate\n\n* Mario Carbone, chef and co-founder of Major Food Group and Carbone Fine Food\n\n* James Carville, Democratic strategist\n\n* Steve Case, co-founder of AOL, chairman and C.E.O. of Revolution\n\n* Ron Chernow, author and historian\n\n* Ezekiel Emanuel, M.D., Ph.D., vice provost of Global Initiatives at the University of Pennsylvania\n\n* Jon Finer, former deputy U.S. national security adviser and co-host of \"The Long Game,\" a podcast\n\n* Amanda Gorman, presidential inaugural poet, activist and UNICEF supporter\n\n* Lucy Guo, founder and C.E.O. of Passes\n\n* Karine Jean-Pierre, author and former White House press secretary to Joe Biden\n\n* Ashley Judd, actor, author and humanitarian\n\n* Garry Kasparov, chairman of the Renew Democracy Initiative, Russian pro-democracy activist and former world chess champion\n\n* Paula Kerger, C.E.O. of PBS\n\n* Monica Lewinsky, activist, producer, podcast host, global speaker and contributing editor to Vanity Fair\n\n* J.

And other Democrats quickly criticized the deal as a concession on the central justification for the shutdown fight.\n\nThe latest: Eight senators in the Democratic caucus voted with Republicans to approve a measure that would fund most federal agencies through January. Key to its passage was a new provision that reverses the layoffs of federal workers during the shutdown and ensures that furloughed employees receive back pay.\n\nIt also includes a promise by Senator John Thune, the majority leader, to hold a vote on extending health insurance subsidies set to expire at the end of the year.\n\nDemocrats were unlikely to get a concession on the health care tax credits, Senator Angus King, the Maine independent who caucuses with Democrats, said about why he and other colleagues voted for the bill. He added that Democrats \"still have a chance\" of getting the credits reinstated via the promised vote, though it's considered improbable given Republican control of Congress.\n\n\"In the meantime, a lot of people are being hurt,\" he added.\n\nThat pain includes growing delays at U.S. airports, as federal restrictions on flying led to thousands of flights being canceled this past weekend. The F.A.A. is set to widen those limits by Friday, to at least 10 percent of flights from the current 4 percent. And restrictions on business jets and private planes at some major airports are set to take effect on Monday.\n\n\"It's only going to get worse,\" Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said on CNN on Sunday, adding that air travel would \"be reduced to a trickle\" leading into the busy Thanksgiving holiday.\n\nThe Trump administration also put more pressure on states over food-stamp services, threatening harsh financial penalties for any that didn't \"immediately undo\" steps to provide full benefits. (However, a federal appeals court in Boston late last night rejected the administration's effort to avoid paying full benefits.)\n\nWhen would the government reopen? The measure approved last night must still win approval by the full Senate, pass the House and be signed by President Trump.\n\nBut some progressive Democratic lawmakers and Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, have threatened to effectively delay consideration of the legislation by several days.\n\nExclusive: A.I. start-up Gamma secures a big fund-raising round\n\nVenture capitalists' appetite for artificial intelligence start-ups remains enormous: The field now accounts for nearly two-thirds of all venture deals in the U.S., according to PitchBook.\n\nThe latest example of that fervor is Gamma, a start-up seeking to build a PowerPoint for the A.I. era. The company plans to announce on Monday that it has raised $68 million in new financing, Niko Gallogly is first to report.\n\nThe new round values Gamma at $2.1 billion. The effort was led by Andreessen Horowitz, the big venture capital firm that is a new investor in the company. Accel, which led Gamma's previous fund-raising round early last year, also participated.\n\nGamma was founded in 2020 by Grant Lee and two other entrepreneurs who saw an opportunity to use artificial intelligence to let users quickly turn text into sleek presentations. Slide decks are \"the language of business,\" Lee told DealBook, but require too much time \"moving pixels\" around instead of focusing on substance.\n\nThe generative A.I. boom \"breathed new life\" into Gamma's business, by unlocking capabilities in image and text modeling, said Sarah Wang, the Andreessen Horowitz partner who led the deal. Gamma has been profitable since 2023, executives said, and employs just 52 full-time employees, up from 28 earlier this year.\n\nThe company has grown since its previous round, amassing about 70 million customers -- more than 600,000 of whom pay a subscription fee -- and collecting about $100 million in annual revenue.\n\nThe start-up will use proceeds from the round to continue building services for corporate users. (It recently began offering a business account.) Lee said Gamma would also invest in A.I. talent and invest more in its international business. About 80 percent of Gamma's users are outside of the United States.\n\nBut Gamma faces steep competition. Microsoft and Google are spending billions in A.I. to improve their product offerings. And upstarts including Beautiful.ai and Canva, offer similar products.\n\nTHE SPEED READ\n\nDeals\n\n* Pfizer won a bidding war with Novo Nordisk over Metsera, a developer of obesity treatments, with a sweetened $10 billion takeover offer.

(Matt McClain/The W...", "content": "President Donald Trump in the Oval Office with Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. during an event with pharmaceutical companies Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk on Thursday November. (Matt McClain/The Washington Post)\n\nA man's dramatic collapse in the Oval Office last week and Trump officials' reactions grabbed public attention, inspired \"Saturday Night Live\" and fueled internet conspiracy theories -- with the fallout overshadowing the intended focus of Thursday's White House event on new price cuts for weight-loss drugs.\n\nImages of Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. appearing to leave as the man was in crisis, and President Donald Trump staring straight ahead as the chaotic scene unfolded behind him, were dissected on cable news segments this weekend and amplified by critics of the president. But they do not tell the complete story of a policy-laden event disrupted by a medical emergency, and some of the commentary has been inaccurate.\n\nThe man who collapsed was not a pharmaceutical executive, as \"Saturday Night Live\" and others have alleged, but a patient who had taken one of the companies' weight-loss drugs. Kennedy, by all accounts, was going to get help. And the photo of Trump staring straight ahead captured a brief moment after the president rose from his chair and pivoted to see others administer aid; he looked away as White House officials ushered everyone from the room.\n\nWhite House officials have spent days offering their own version of events and have protested depictions of Trump and his aides as uncaring.\n\n\"The Secretary rushed to get medical assistance while others tended to the man, you ghoul,\" Kush Desai, a White House spokesman, posted on social media, rebuking one prominent X user who claimed that Kennedy was trying to leave the room \"as quickly as possible.\"\n\nMehmet Oz, a physician who serves as a top Trump deputy, immediately stepped in to help the man and cared for him until White House medical personnel arrived. The man swiftly recovered, officials said.\n\nThe Oval Office event has drawn scrutiny for other reasons: Trump was caught on camera appearing to fend off sleep for nearly 20 minutes, a Washington Post analysis found. California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) dubbed Trump \"The Nodfather\" online, mocking the president's seeming struggle to stake awake during the presentation on GLP-1 price cuts. The White House has denied that Trump was dozing off and suggested questions about the matter were inappropriate.\n\nBut with public attention focused firmly on the spectacle, the administration has struggled to keep attention on an underlying policy achievement widely heralded as progress by public health experts. And the news conference -- split into two segments, interrupted by the man's 10-second collapse and the resulting fallout -- has been mostly unhelpful for the White House.\n\nAhead of Thursday, administration officials had initially hoped the drug-price event would draw mass attention, promising that their upcoming announcement would be \"historic.\" The event was part of their campaign to pressure pharmaceutical companies to cut their prices -- with Trump demanding near-weekly announcements of every concession by the industry.\n\nOfficials were thrilled to tout this as their biggest win yet: a deal with two companies to lower the price of popular weight-loss drugs and expand Medicare access to them.\n\n\"It was truly the single most significant announcement relating to drugs, drug pricing in the history of our country,\" Medicare official Chris Klomp said on the Fox Business channel.\n\nOutside experts have not gone that far, but credited Trump's move as a potential tactic to curb the nation's obesity epidemic and cut health spending. Some Democrats have offered grudging praise.\n\nBut visuals of the event have distracted attention from its purpose.\n\nBoth pharmaceutical firms, Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly, were allowed to have two representatives standing behind the president, shoulder-to-shoulder with senior Trump officials in the Oval Office.\n\nAnd it was one of those guests -- a man in his 60s, invited by Eli Lilly because of his experience taking their GLP-1 drugs, according to three people who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe a sensitive situation -- whose collapse, about 30 minutes into the news conference, precipitated a chaotic scramble that has since shaped the news cycle.\n\nMultiple news reports wrongly identified the man as a Novo Nordisk executive, with many prominent social media users basing their conclusion on a LinkedIn headshot. Some accounts and news outlets have yet to retract the false information, which continues to spread.\n\nMuch of the cable-news coverage focused on Trump's own actions. The president's behavior as the man collapsed was abhorrent, said Lawrence O'Donnell, an MSNBC host who devoted a 17-minute segment on his show to analyzing the moment.\n\n\"This image captured Donald Trump's ability to completely ignore a person in need,\" O'Donnell said on his Thursday night broadcast, comparing Trump to past presidents that he said would have rushed to help.\n\nFellow MSNBC hosts, CBS late-night host Stephen Colbert and other TV personalities and online pundits have also discussed the Oval Office emergency and circulated the images of Trump and his aides on their platforms -- mostly jibing at the White House. The scene was parodied three times on \"Saturday Night Live,\" including in a four-minute segment to start the show that suggested the collapsing man was a medical professional who nearly died \"at the mere thought of charging less for drugs.\"\n\n\"I think I'm playing this very normal: Just stand there and stare like a sociopath,\" comedian James Austin Johnson, in the role of Trump, told viewers. \"Didn't even pretend like I was gonna help.\"\n\nOz, Trump's deputy, has countered that the president personally sought to reassure the man's anxious wife after reporters left.\n\n\"He said, 'Give me that phone,' and he talked to her and got her much calmer than I could've done,\" Oz said in a video clip shared by the administration. \"He's just a wonderful human being that he would take time.\"\n\nThe White House has excised the frantic scene from its own channels, removing the original video with the medical emergency and replacing it with a version that elides the moment.", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/11/09/oval-office-chaos-man-collapsing/"}

Wes Moore on Sunday defended the creation of a redistricting committee to edge out the single Republican-held seat in his state, saying he's \"not sure why we should be playing by a different set of rules than Texas, or than Florida, or than Ohio or all these other places.\"\n\n\"I want this bipartisan commission to be able to actually speak with the people and to be able to go through their process and just simply say that if other states are going to go through this process, that we're not just going to sit on our hands because Donald Trump tells us to,\" Moore said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan. \"That's not the way this process is going to work.\"\n\nLast week, Moore announced he had formed a commission to explore mid-decade redistricting in the state, following the lead of President Trump's push to redraw districts in GOP-led states Texas, Missouri and North Carolina to net more seats for Republicans.\n\nWhile Democrats initially decried Mr. Trump's efforts as an attempt to create an unfair advantage for Republicans, California's Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom pushed a ballot measure to redraw the state's congressional districts to gain up to five seats for Democrats. The measure, known as Prop 50, passed Tuesday with more than 60% of the vote, and an energized Newsom held a rally in Houston on Saturday, where he said Texas had \"woke us up.\"\n\nEight of Maryland's nine House seats are already occupied by Democrats, a state former Vice President Kamala Harris won by more than 28 points in 2024. A redistricting effort would target the single Republican-held seat in the eastern part of the state.\n\nMaryland's commission is chaired by U.S. Sen. Angela Alsobrooks, a close ally of Moore's, and is comprised of Senate President Bill Ferguson, Maryland House Speaker Adrienne A. Jones, former Attorney General Brian Frosh and Cumberland Mayor Raymond Morriss.\n\nFerguson, a Democrat, has opposed the redistricting effort, writing in a letter last month that \"mid-cycle redistricting for Maryland presents a reality where the legal risks are too high, the timeline for action is dangerous, the downside risk to Democrats is catastrophic, and the certainty of our existing map would be undermined.\"\n\nFerguson said last week the Democrats' election victories \"shows we don't need to rig the system to win.\"\n\nBut Moore insisted Sunday that \"fighting for democracy is never risky.\" He noted that he and Ferguson agree that there is a \"crisis that Donald Trump has put us in.\"\n\n\"Where we differ is the urgency that this moment requires, the fight that this moment requires,\" Moore said. \"And I personally am someone who is not going to allow Donald Trump to determine whether or not Maryland follows this idea of saying, are we going to do everything we can to make sure we're preserving our democracy.\"", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/wes-moore-maryland-redistricting-face-the-nation/"}

The perpetually grinning 34-year-old wunderkind immediately promised to facilitate his collectivist plans.\n\nThese include a rent freeze, government-owned grocery stores (like in communist Cuba), \"free\" public transit, \"free\" child care, a \"tax on millionaires\" and other ways to turn America's biggest city into a socialist hellhole.\n\nBefore long, New Yorkers may well be crying out for help from \"Snake Plissken.\" He is the antihero played by Kurt Russell in the 1981 dystopian John Carpenter movie mentioned by Mr. Treacher. Plissken is a war vet turned criminal who is blackmailed into rescuing the president of the United States, whose plane has crashed into New York City. Crime is so bad in the city that the government has sealed it off from the rest of the country.\n\nThe film deserves its R rating for violence and a torrent of profanity.\n\nGetting back to the election, I don't think \"blowout\" is adequate to describe the breadth of the Democratic sweep across the country. They won pretty much everything on every ballot.\n\nBy keeping the federal shutdown going, Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer, New York Democrat, ensured plenty of pain, especially in Northern Virginia's Washington suburbs. Democrats could have ended it by approving one of the 14 funding bills passed by the House, but they correctly calculated that their media would blame it on Republicans -- as usual.\n\nWhile Mr. Schumer smirked for cameras, I thought of this passage from Psalm 37: \"Do not fret because of him who prospers in his way, because of the man who brings wicked schemes to pass. Cease from anger and forsake wrath; Do not fret -- it only causes harm.\"\n\nOK, no fretting allowed, even though voters approved California Gov. Gavin Newsom's gerrymandering plan, elected liberal Democrats as governor in New Jersey and Virginia, along with Virginia's two other statewide offices, and added at least 10 state House seats in Virginia, giving them a supermajority.\n\nDemocrats will have total power in Richmond. The last time they got it, they initiated a far-left agenda in 2020. This included gun control laws, eliminating voter ID, expanding voter rights for felons, adding sexual orientation and gender identity to anti-discrimination laws, banning counseling for gender-confused minors, and legalizing marijuana and sports betting.\n\nThis time, they aim to gerrymander congressional districts and pass constitutional amendments enshrining abortion and same-sex marriage. So, buckle up, Old Dominion.\n\nVirginians had given Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin an overall high approval rate. Yet Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears lost the governor's race badly to faux centrist Democrat Abigail Spanberger. Attorney General Jason Miyares lost to Jay Jones, whose surfaced texts showed him dreaming of killing a former Republican House speaker and his children.\n\nPundits sum it up in one word: Trump. Yet there's more to it. President Trump elicits strong emotions because of his pugnacious personality. He knows the left will try to destroy him no matter how nice he is. (Think of Mitt Romney.) Mr. Trump also picks a lot of unnecessary fights. Does the leader of the free world really have to weigh in on Sydney Sweeney's jeans ads?\n\nYou can't underestimate the power of the media to undercut Mr. Trump's considerable accomplishments. For example, most Americans support his securing the border, ensuring renewal of the 2017 tax cuts and his bold move to bomb Iran's nuclear weapons facilities. These are now ancient history. Gas prices and inflation, driven up during the Biden administration, have fallen, but not by enough. The jury is still out on the effect of his tariffs.\n\nMr. Trump's various peace initiatives in the Gaza Strip and elsewhere may net him a Nobel Prize, but they don't ease the economic crunch facing many American families. He has been back in office for only 10 months, but Democrats and their media are hammering him for not cleaning up the mess they left fast enough.\n\nThere's also the perception of overreach. It's one thing to see criminal illegal aliens arrested and another to see footage of masked federal agents accosting mothers, fathers and children. As with the abortion issue, the media play up hard cases and ignore the overall reality. It's sad but no surprise that Virginia's female voters went for pro-abortion Ms. Spanberger by 59% to 38% for pro-life Ms. Earle-Sears.\n\nSome pundits have already written off Republicans in the 2026 midterms, but a lot can happen between now and then. Democrats are riven between their insurgent Marxist wing and what's left of their moderates. Republicans are narrowing the party registration gap in key states such as Pennsylvania and are raising more money than the Democrats.\n\nDemocrats are justifiably giddy right now, but the stark reality of a Mamdani-run New York may well reignite enthusiasm among Republicans and independents.\n\nThe game isn't over. Few political losses or victories are permanent, and Democrats are quite capable of blowing it again.\n\nFor conservative Virginians, it's going to be a tough couple of years. For New Yorkers -- and the rest of the country -- let's pray that it won't take the likes of Snake Plissken to turn things around.", "url": "https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2025/nov/9/2025-elections-wake-call-republicans-warning-democrats/"}

He's an angel investor, a best-selling author, and a personal-finance guru. He podcasts constantly: his hosting duties include \"The Prof G Pod,\" which offers business-news takes and career advice; \"Pivot,\" in which he riffs on news of the day with the tech journalist Kara Swisher; and the self-explanatory \"Raging Moderates,\" with the Fox News personality Jessica Tarlov. For someone of this \u00dcbermensch milieu, he is surprisingly progressive and self-aware -- he often acknowledges that his wealth and achievements were made likelier by his race, sex, publicly funded education, and devoted mother, who raised him mostly on her own.\n\nIn recent years, Galloway has also become a leading evangelist for a notion that rapidly solidified into conventional wisdom: America's young men are in crisis. \"Seldom in recent memory has there been a cohort that's fallen farther, faster,\" he writes in his new book, \"Notes on Being a Man.\" To make his case, Galloway pulls from a heavily circulated set of statistics. At colleges and universities nationwide, female students outnumber males by about three to two. Among young adults, men are more likely than women to live with their parents; by their mid-thirties, more than fifteen per cent of men still live with their folks, compared to less than nine per cent of women. Men die by suicide at about three and a half times the rate that women do. Men's real wages are lower for the tenth and fiftieth percentiles of earners than they were in 1979. Currently, the unemployment rate among young men with bachelor's degrees between the ages of twenty-three and thirty is close to double that of their female peers.\n\nThese numbers have roused bipartisan concern. In March, Governor Gavin Newsom, of California, on the d\u00e9but episode of his new podcast, welcomed the conservative influencer Charlie Kirk, who lamented Gen Z as the \"most alcohol-addicted, most drug-addicted, most suicidal, most depressed, most medicated generation in history.\" And these under-thirties, Kirk said, were receiving a pernicious message: \"You're not going to have the same American Dream that your parents would have.\" He and his fellow conservative organizers \"saw this as an opportunity,\" he added, \"especially with young men.\" Donald Trump won men under age thirty by fifty-six per cent in the 2024 election, up fifteen points from 2020. For these gains, Kirk credited the coalescing electoral power of the right-leaning constellation of podcasters and streamers known as the manosphere, which encompasses libertarian bros, evangelical Christians, and white nationalists.\n\nNewsom, who is angling to become the next Democratic Presidential nominee, appeared to be listening closely. At the end of July, he issued an executive order intended \"to confront California's growing crisis of connection and opportunity for men and boys.\" A week later, another likely Democratic contender, the former Chicago mayor Rahm Emanuel, published an op-ed in the Washington Post that linked unaffordable housing and health care to an \"increasingly despondent\" mood among young men. \"You don't have to be an incel to believe that the 'system' is fundamentally broken and rigged against your success,\" Emanuel wrote.", "url": "https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-weekend-essay/what-did-men-do-to-deserve-this"}

(AP) -- The Trump administration's legal efforts to fight having to fully fund food stamps for millions of vulnerable Americans is creating an opening for Democrats eager to use the longest government shutdown in U.S. history to paint the president as callous and out of touch.\n\n\"Donald Trump and his administration have made the decision to weaponize hunger, to withhold SNAP benefits from millions of people, notwithstanding the fact that two lower courts, both the district court and the court of appeals, made clear that those SNAP benefits needed to be paid immediately,\" House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries said on CNN Saturday, calling the actions \"shameful.\"\n\n\"Donald Trump is literally fighting in court to ensure Americans starve. HE DOES NOT CARE ABOUT YOU,\" echoed California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a potential 2028 presidential contender, on X.\n\nThe comments come after the Supreme Court late Friday granted the administration's emergency appeal to temporarily block a court order requiring it to fully fund SNAP food aid payments amid the shutdown. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program serves about 1 in 8 Americans, mostly those with lower incomes.\n\nA judge had given the administration until Friday to make the payments. But the administration asked an appeals court to suspend any orders requiring it to spend more money than is available in a contingency fund, and to move forward with planned partial SNAP payments for the month instead.\n\nThe legal wrangling comes after the administration and Republicans endured a bruising Election Day last week. Democrats scored commanding wins up and down the ballot and on ballot measures across the country amid signs that voters' economic woes are top of mind - a warning sign for the president and his party heading into next year's higher-stakes midterm elections.\n\nIn response, the White House is planning to adjust its messaging strategy to focus on affordability to try to win over voters who are worried about the high cost of living with plans to emphasize new tax breaks and show progress on fighting inflation.\n\nBut its efforts around food stamps could complicate that.\n\nBoth parties have tried to blame the other for the shutdown as its impact has spread beyond Washington, D.C., including a growing crisis at the nation's airports.\n\nAn Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll conducted in October, as the shutdown stretched into its third week, found that roughly 6 in 10 Americans said Trump and Republicans in Congress bore \"a great deal\" or \"quite a bit\" of responsibility for the shutdown, while 54% said the same about Democrats in Congress. At least three-quarters said both sides deserved at least a \"moderate\" share of blame.\n\nThe White House did not respond to questions Saturday about its rationale for appealing the SNAP orders to the Supreme Court or whether it was concerned about the optics of fighting against making the full payments.\n\nAgriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, appearing on Fox News, again blamed Democrats for refusing to vote to reopen the government and made the case that funding had to come from Congress.\n\n\"We can't just create money out of the sky,\" she said. \"You can't just create money to fund a program that Congress refuses to fund.\"\n\nWhile hundreds of thousands of federal workers have been furloughed and gone over a month without paychecks, the president has gone out of his way to ensure those he favors have been paid.\n\nThat includes members of the military after Trump directed the Pentagon to use \"all available funds\" to pay U.S. troops.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has said her department had found a way to pay the U.S. Coast Guard and law enforcement officers within the department, including border patrol agents and immigration officers with funds from the sweeping \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act\" Trump signed this summer.\n\nAnd FBI director Kash Patel has said that FBI special agents are still being paid - though other bureau workers are not. The administration has not said where that money is coming from.\n\nTrump has repeatedly voiced skepticism about SNAP, and he and the White House have offered conflicting messages on what would happen to the program during the shutdown.\n\nIn a social media post Tuesday, Trump announced that the administration would not pay out any SNAP benefits until the shutdown was over, and suggested that some who receive benefits are not really in need.\n\nHours later, however, press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the administration would pay out partial SNAP benefits using contingency funding \"that is supposed to be for emergencies, catastrophes, for war.\"\n\nBut when asked Thursday about a judge ordering the administration to make the full payment, the president directed Vice President JD Vance, who was sitting next to him, to answer.\n\nVance called the ruling \"absurd,\" because, he said, \"you have a federal judge effectively telling us what we have to do in the midst of a Democrat government shutdown.\"\"\n\n\"In the midst of a shutdown, we can't have a federal court telling the president how he has to triage the situation,\" he said.\n\nTrump added that he believes the country \"has to remain very liquid because problems, catastrophes, wars, could be anything. We have to remain liquid. We can't give everything away.\"\n\nThe administration has faced lawsuits from Democratic-leaning states, nonprofits and cities since shortly after announcing that SNAP benefits would not be available in November because of the shutdown.\n\nBut two judges separately ordered the government to keep the money following, ruling last week that the administration could not skip November's benefits entirely. In both cases, the judges ordered the government to use an emergency reserve fund containing more than $4.6 billion to make the payments, which cost between $8.5 billion and $9 billion each month.\n\nAfter the administration announced it would cover only 65% of the maximum monthly benefit, one judge ruled that they could not and would need to find the money to fully fund the program for November.\n\nThe Justice Department filed an emergency appeal. In its court filings Friday, the administration contended that the judge had usurped both legislative and executive authority. When a higher court refused to nullify the Friday payment deadline, the Trump administration turned quickly to the Supreme Court.\n\nThrough an order signed by liberal Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, the high court agreed to keep the full-payment order on hold until 48 hours after the appeals court rules on whether to issue a more lasting pause. Jackson, a frequent dissenter from a series of recent decisions in favor of the administration, is the justice assigned to oversee appeals from Rhode Island, where the case originated.\n\nThe legal wrangling has left millions of Americans who depend on food aid in confusing limbo. People in some states have reported receiving their full benefits for November, while others could be waiting until at least next week.", "url": "https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2025/nov/8/democrats-seize-trump-administrations-efforts-fight-food-stamp/"}

Her reason for the switch: Gerrymandering. (Video: Sean Carter, Reena Flores, Laura Benshoff, Savannah Robinson, Joshua Carroll, Colby Itkowitz/The Washington Post)\n\nWhen Kate Barr ran for a state senate seat in North Carolina last year, she pitched herself to voters as a \"loser.\"\n\nNow, Barr has declared her bid for Congress. This time, she says she could actually win.\n\nThe difference? She's running as a Republican.\n\nBarr, a 43-year-old lifelong Democrat, has changed her party registration to run in the GOP primary against incumbent Rep. Tim Moore, who represents North Carolina's 14th congressional district. She says it's the only way to compete for a gerrymandered seat whose boundaries were drawn to heavily favor Republicans.\n\nBarr sat down with The Washington Post's Post Reports podcast to explain why this time she decided to switch parties and compete in a primary race.\n\n\"My message is really about fairness. And it's consistent with when I ran for state senate in '24,\" she said. \"We need fair maps. We deserve fair elections. We, as voters, should be able to hold our elected leaders accountable. And it is wrong that we can't.\"\n\nThe odds still aren't great for Barr. Moore has local name recognition after more than 20 years in the state House, including 10 as speaker. He's also actually a Republican in a Republican primary. Barr is not and does not plan to pretend she is beyond the \"R\" next to her name on the ballot.\n\nJordan Shaw, a Moore campaign adviser, dismissed Barr's challenge.\n\n\"All I know about this person is what I found in 15 seconds on her website: that she's a far-left liberal. Good luck selling that to GOP voters,\" he said.\n\nBut 38 percent of the district's voters are registered as unaffiliated, meaning they can vote in either party's primary. Barr says that makes this electoral quest more achievable than trying to run in a general election as a Democrat in a district with a predetermined outcome.\n\nBarr ran her first race in 2024 singularly focused on raising awareness about gerrymandering, the overtly partisan practice of drawing election maps to benefit one political party. Davidson, the small college town north of Charlotte where she lives, shares a district with mostly rural, conservative areas to the west that make it effectively impossible for a Democrat to compete there.\n\nAs she predicted, despite running an all-out campaign with yard signs and door knocking and events, she lost that race handily by nearly 30 percentage points.\n\nBarr's focus on gerrymandering also comes at a moment when the Democratic Party has chosen to embrace the practice in response to President Donald Trump's calls for Republicans to redraw congressional maps in red states to increase the chances of keeping the U.S. House majority in next year's midterms. This week, California voters overwhelmingly supported a plan put forward by Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) to redraw its maps to gain more Democratic seats in hopes of staving off Republican gains elsewhere.\n\nBarr, who has become an evangelist to end gerrymandering, said she is conflicted about her party's strategy. She thinks hers is better.\n\n\"I understand why the Democratic Party feels like their response needs to look like gerrymandering in return,\" she said. \"This is a losing race to the bottom, and it's horrifying to me.

But the administration asked the appeals court to suspend any court orders requiring it to spend more money than is available in a contingency fund, and instead allow it to continue with planned partial SNAP payments for the month.\n\nThe court filing came even as the U.S. Department of Agriculture said in a memo to states that it's working to make funds available Friday for full monthly SNAP benefits.\n\nCalifornia and Wisconsin said some SNAP recipients already received their full November payments overnight on Thursday.\n\n\"Food benefits are now beginning to flow back to California families,\" Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a statement. A spokesperson for Democratic Gov. Tony Evers of Wisconsin also confirmed that full SNAP payments had gone through.\n\nThe court wrangling prolonged weeks of uncertainty for the food program that serves about 1 in 8 Americans, mostly with lower incomes.\n\nAn individual can receive a monthly maximum food benefit of nearly $300 and a family of four up to nearly $1,000, although many receive less than that under a formula that takes into consideration their income. For many SNAP participants, it remains unclear exactly how much they will receive this month, and when they will receive it.\n\nJasmen Youngbey of Newark, New Jersey, waited in line Friday at a food pantry in the state's largest city. As a single mom attending college, Youngbey said she relies on SNAP to help feed her 7-month-old and 4-year-old sons. But she said her account balance was at $0.\n\n\"Not everybody has cash to pull out and say, 'OK, I'm going to go and get this,' especially with the cost of food right now. It's now possible,\" she said.\n\nTihinna Franklin, a school bus guard who was waiting in the same line outside the United Community Corporation food pantry, said her SNAP account balance was at 9 cents and she was down to three items in her freezer. She typically relies on the roughly $290 a month in SNAP benefits to help feed her grandchildren.\n\n\"If I don't get it, I won't be eating,\" she said. \"My money I get paid for, that goes to the bills, rent, electricity, personal items. That is not fair to us as mothers and caregivers.\"\n\nBecause of the federal government shutdown, the Trump administration originally had said SNAP benefits would not be available in November. However, two judges ruled last week that the administration could not skip November's benefits entirely because of the shutdown. One of those judges was U.S. District Judge John J. McConnell Jr., who ordered the full payments Thursday.\n\nIn both cases, the judges ordered the government to use one emergency reserve fund containing more than $4.6 billion to pay for SNAP for November but gave it leeway to tap other money to make the full payments, which cost between $8.5 billion and $9 billion each month.\n\nOn Monday, the administration said it would not use additional money, saying it was up to Congress to appropriate the funds for the program and that the other money was needed to shore up other child hunger programs.\n\nThursday's federal court order rejected the Trump administration's decision to cover only 65% of the maximum monthly benefit, a decision that could have left some recipients getting nothing for this month.\n\nIn its court filing Friday, Trump's administration contended that Thursday's directive to fund full SNAP benefits runs afoul of the U.S. Constitution.\n\n\"This unprecedented injunction makes a mockery of the separation of powers. Courts hold neither the power to appropriate nor the power to spend,\" the U.S. Department of Justice wrote in its request to the court.\n\nIn response, attorneys for the cities and nonprofits challenging Trump's administration said the government has plenty of available money and the court should \"not allow them to further delay getting vital food assistance to individuals and families who need it now.\"\n\nSome states said they stood ready to distribute SNAP money as quickly as possible.\n\nThe Michigan Department of Health and Human Services said people who normally receive benefits early in each month should get their full SNAP allotment within 48 hours of funds becoming available, and others should receive their full benefits on their regularly scheduled dates.\n\nMeanwhile, North Carolina's Department of Health and Human Services said that partial SNAP benefits were distributed Friday, based on the Trump administration's previous decision. Officials in Illinois and North Dakota also said they were distributing partial November payments, starting as soon as Friday.\n\nIn Missouri, the Department of Social Services said Friday that it was awaiting further federal guidance. Meanwhile, St. Louis Mayor Cara Spencer urged people to donate to a newly created local fund for emergency food assistance\n\nAmid the federal uncertainty, Delaware's Democratic Gov. Matt Meyer said the state used its own funds Friday to provide the first of could be a weekly relief payment to SNAP recipients.\n\nConnecticut's Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont said Friday that he authorized about $72 million of surplus state funds to provide the equivalent of full SNAP benefits for November. People should get the money within four days.\n\n\"This herky-jerky back and forth is driving people crazy,\" Lamont said. \"Let's take care of people. We can afford to do it.\"\n\n___\n\nLieb reported from Jefferson City, Missouri, and Bauer from Madison, Wisconsin.

His home in the community of Altadena was destroyed in the blaze, and he was left facing a series of hard financial choices.\n\nWith only the coverage offered by the state's last-resort insurance plan, Mr. Kecman estimates that he will receive about $1 million, only enough to build a house about a third smaller than the one he lost. The cost to insure the new structure is likely to be much higher, too, now that carriers are asking for rate increases to offset rising wildfire risks.\n\nMr. Kecman is among the thousands of Californians affected by the fires who say a broken insurance market is hampering their ability to rebuild their lives. On Thursday, many of them gathered in Altadena to urge Gov. Gavin Newsom to install a new insurance commissioner, require insurers to pay outstanding claims and ensure that consumers are protected as companies raise premiums.\n\n\"We thought we could trust the system,\" Mr. Kecman, a 64-year-old electrical engineer, said at a news conference organized by the Eaton Fire Survivors Network.\n\nMr. Kecman said he had found it encouraging that Ricardo Lara, the state insurance commissioner, had drafted new regulations not long before the fires that would require carriers to write policies in risky parts of the state in exchange for higher rates. But he and others cited a New York Times story from last week that revealed how a series of loopholes could allow insurers to qualify to charge the higher rates merely by writing new policies in the areas where they had recently dumped customers like him.\n\nThe investigation found that there were no guarantees that a substantial number of new policies would be written in the state's high-risk fire areas.\n\n\"I understand that agencies don't always live up to the idea that they serve the best interests of the people,\" Mr. Kecman said in an interview. \"But I felt gut-punched when I found out.\"\n\nAfter the Times story was published, Mr. Lara said that his department knew that insurance companies and others would try to find and exploit loopholes. \"This is not a surprise to anyone that has dealt with them,\" Mr. Lara said in a statement. \"If it is, welcome to Earth. All eyes are on insurance companies, including mine and The New York Times.\"\n\nMichael Soller, California's deputy insurance commissioner, said the regulations allowing insurers to charge higher rates, called the Sustainable Insurance Strategy, had been open to public scrutiny for more than a year. \"Last time I checked, a hearing room is not a backroom,\" he said.\n\n\"Commissioner Lara has moved quickly and decisively to respond to the fires, including using every tool available to ensure wildfire survivors receive all the benefits they are entitled to under current law,\" Mr. Soller said.\n\nHe added that the department had told insurers to fully investigate and pay legitimate smoke damage claims and had recovered more than $135 million for wildfire survivors. He said that insurance companies had paid more than $20 billion on more than 41,800 claims, with 92 percent of claims fully paid or underway.\n\nMr. Newsom's office did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nJoy Chen, the head of the Eaton Fire Survivors Network, said on Thursday that homeowners wanted Mr. Newsom to enforce consumer protection laws and build a functioning insurance system.\n\nMore than eight out of 10 of those whose homes were destroyed by the fires in Altadena and the Pacific Palisades section of Los Angeles are still displaced, and 70 percent of insured Eaton and Palisades survivors have faced delays in receiving insurance payments or denials of coverage, according to data from the Department of Angels, a nonprofit created after the Los Angeles fires to help with the recovery effort.\n\n\"Our entire housing market will collapse if families can't buy or renew insurance, and if those who have it can't get the benefits they've paid for,\" Ms. Chen said.\n\nCarmel Kadrnka, a physician from Pacific Palisades who watched Thursday's event online, said that State Farm had dropped her fire coverage in August 2024, five months before the fire destroyed her home. Like Mr. Kecman, she was put on the FAIR plan, the state's fire insurer of last resort, and had to buy additional property insurance to cover other liabilities like water damage and vandalism.\n\nBefore Ms. Kadrnka was dumped by State Farm, she paid about $20,000 a year in premiums for about $7 million worth of coverage on her home and adjacent structures, personal property and living expenses if she could not live in her house.\n\nAfter she lost that policy, she paid around $27,000 a year for her FAIR plan fire policy and additional State Farm property insurance, but her coverage was capped at $3 million. Now that she has lost her home, she does not have enough coverage to replace her house and her personal belongings, not to mention renting a temporary home in one of the nation's most expensive markets.\n\n\"No one can tell us whether we'll even be able to get coverage in the future,\" she added. \"There's no information that says, Yes, if you build your home in a certain way, make it fire-hardened, invest in all the recommendations that the insurance companies are making, that they will actually agree to cover your property,\" she said. \"There are no guarantees. We don't know how to move forward.\"", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/06/us/la-fires-insurance-homeowners.html"}

Gavin Newsom as a response to the new Texas congressional maps that Republicans drew up at Donald Trump's request, which could take up to five seats away from Democrats in next year's midterms.\n\nOn Wednesday, California Republicans sued to stop the state from moving forward with redistricting and claimed the new map is unfair -- even as their party seeks to gerrymander other red states.\n\nIt appears Republicans are pretty much committed to picking their voters, rather than letting the voters pick them. This year, four Republican-controlled states have already redrawn their maps at Trump's request: Texas, Missouri, Ohio and North Carolina. The new maps would flip nine seats to Republicans -- at least in theory.\n\nBut nobody is talking about stopping there. Republicans in Indiana, Nebraska and Florida are all at least exploring redder congressional maps at Trump's behest. And several Democratic-controlled states are talking about responding in kind.\n\nWe are in a gerrymandering arms race, and there is no mystery as to why. After Tuesday's drubbing, House Speaker Mike Johnson made it clear that redistricting is how Republicans think they will win.\n\n\"I think the midterm is gonna be a great one for us,\" Johnson told reporters on Wednesday. \"We had a demographic shift in 2024. We have a very favorable election map on the Republican side, and it will be even more favorable once all the redistricting stuff has settled out.\"\n\nBut based on what we saw at the polls, I'm not so sure redistricting alone is going to be enough for Republicans. If you are pulling supporters from a deep-red district to make another district red, you end up with two less-red districts. You also can't guarantee that your red voters from the last election will turn out for you again.\n\nThat means the Republicans' plan could backfire. If voters are angry enough at them, as they were on Tuesday, Republicans could lose both those \"red\" districts. Political scientists even have a word for the phenomenon: \"dummymandering.\"\n\nDumb or not, this is how Republicans think they'll win. But as Newsom said on Tuesday, they will be opposed.\n\nThe California governor had a message for his fellow blue state governors: \"We need the state of Virginia. We need the state of Maryland. We need our friends in New York and Illinois and Colorado. We need to see other states, the remarkable leaders that have been doing remarkable things, meet this moment head-on as well.\"", "url": "https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/california-proposition-50-redistricting-dummymandering-midterms-rcna242392"}

What did we learn from the voters?\n\nHistory repeats itself\n\nThe historical trend in New Jersey and Virginia is that the party opposite the incumbent president wins the gubernatorial race. With voters electing a Democrat for governor while Republican President Trump is in office, the trend continues.\n\nThat said, Republicans should not brush off the results as a routine trend. One, the margins of victory were larger than most expected them to be in the final results. Republican Glenn Youngkin won four years ago when Democrat Joseph R. Biden was president, but he polled just above 50%. Democrat Abigail Spanberger won with more than 57% of the vote. That helped other Democrats win close elections throughout the commonwealth.\n\nAlthough the party opposite the White House typically wins the gubernatorial races in Virginia and New Jersey, it can often serve as a bellwether for the midterm elections.\n\nVoters elected Republican Christine Todd Whitman as governor a year after Democrat Bill Clinton was elected president. The following year, a wave of Republicans retook the House and Senate as well as many other governorships across the country. The same thing happened the year after Republican Chris Christie was elected governor in New Jersey, when Barack Obama was in his first year as president.\n\nIt also goes the other way. In 2017, Democrat Phil Murphy was elected governor of New Jersey when Republican Donald Trump was president. During the 2018 Democratic wave, Republicans lost the House and many gubernatorial races. The same thing happened after Democrat Jon Corzine was elected governor in 2005 while Republican George W. Bush was president. Voters in swing states seem to want to counter what they perceive as overreach by either party.\n\nTDS is high in Democratic strongholds\n\nProposition 50 is the California ballot initiative that suspends the maps for congressional districts drawn by an independent commission and replaces them with a gerrymandered map adopted by the state Legislature, which Democrats control. It passed overwhelmingly Tuesday and will cost Republicans House seats from California.\n\nAn exit poll conducted by The Associated Press showed that roughly 7 in 10 voters in California said party control of Congress was \"very important\" to them. Those voters overwhelmingly supported Proposition 50. The exit poll also showed that approximately 80% of voters who supported the measure said it was necessary to counter changes made by Republicans in other states. Only 20% said it was the best way to draw maps.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom made his intentions clear before the vote when he said that if Democrats take the House majority in 2026, it will \"end Donald Trump's presidency as we know it.\" This is just the latest phase in Trump derangement syndrome.\n\nThis phenomenon was also a clear factor in Northern Virginia. The voters in the suburbs of Washington not only gave a clear victory to Ms. Spanberger but also helped elect a Democrat who said he fantasized about putting two bullets in the head of a Republican House speaker. Usually, that would be a disqualification for a candidate seeking to be the state's top prosecutor. Not in Northern Virginia. These people hate President Trump so much that they voted for Democrats across the board.\n\nHouse majority is in jeopardy\n\nMidterm elections are historically tough for the party of the incumbent president. That got much harder after Tuesday. New maps in California will likely cost the Republican Party several seats in the House. The massive blue wave in Virginia also will fuel the move to redraw boundaries there in a way that will make it very difficult for Republicans to hold on to several seats.\n\nPersonality matters\n\nZohran Mamdani is a charismatic candidate. His social media campaign was outstanding. He comes across as likable and was discussing issues that many voters care about.\n\nAfter the 2024 elections, I warned that many of the inroads made with younger voters were based on personality, not policy. Authenticity is a big deal, and they viewed Mr. Trump as genuine and Vice President Kamala Harris as a fraud. Mayor-elect Mamdani embraced his personality-driven brand of socialism, and younger voters liked it.\n\nThat said, New York City is a liberal place. Ms. Harris received two-thirds of the vote there last November. Overall, the rest of the mayoral vote was split between a Republican and a disgraced former governor who was running under a third-party banner. Conservatives need to recruit charismatic candidates.\n\nWages and prices are the big issues\n\nJames Carville famously said during the 1992 presidential campaign, \"It's the economy, stupid.\" He was right. Now it's all about higher wages and lower prices.\n\nTo avoid a blue wave next fall, Republicans must focus on wages and prices. People are genuinely concerned about these issues. They must see results as well as plans for the future. Thankfully, conservatives have answers.

He knows the name of each one in this 4,000-square-foot garden, their history, even their names in Latin. He moves casually but with purpose, pausing to gently scoop up a branch of a Mexican sage bush.\n\nThis one, he explains, is special: It attracts the hummingbird, the symbol for hospice and the reason he and others who tend to the dying wear pins of them on their shirts.\n\nMr. Hite is incarcerated at California Medical Facility in Vacaville, Calif., a medium-security penitentiary within the state's sprawling prison system. Most of the 2,144 men who live here require specialized medical care. Some are dying in the facility's hospice unit. Others, like Mr. Hite, have volunteered to look after their peers in their final days. For them, the unit, and the garden in particular, offers something rare in prison: a sense of purpose and connection.\n\n\"When you get outside these walls, when you're released, you breathe fresh air, freedom air, which is different than the air in here,\" said Mr. Hite, who has been locked up for 48 years. \"But in the garden, you get a little piece of that free air.\"\n\nThe hospice unit at California Medical Facility was built in 1993 in response to the AIDS crisis and demands for more humane care. It was the nation's first licensed hospice program in a prison. It has since become a model for others around the country.\n\nIn addition to a clinical staff, the 17-bed unit employs social workers, psychologists and a chaplain. Some inmates, referred to as pastoral care workers, are trained to provide end-of-life care, helping to bathe patients, clean wounds, change dressings, handle oxygen tanks and assist in whatever other duties nurses request.\n\nBut they also provide companionship, the kind that a family member might: doing puzzles, writing letters and simply spending time with them. Despite their training, pastoral care workers make only about 24 cents an hour -- nearly 75 percent less than the wage for men who sweep the floors of the prison. (Those workers make $1 an hour.) But more than one pastoral care worker said their duties on the unit were more important than making money.\n\n\"If they didn't pay me anything at all, I would still do this,\" said Jerry Judson, who has worked on the unit for the past six years and is the lead technician, responsible for ordering and organizing supplies. \"This work has helped bring me back to humanity.\"\n\nUntil 2018, the unit's garden was little more than a slab of concrete topped by a corrugated roof and ringed by a chain-link fence -- a patio that looked out onto a courtyard of hardpan dirt.\n\nIt has since become the unit's centerpiece: A place where staffing meetings happen, where families reunite for the first time in decades, where men are wheeled out in their hospital beds for one last look at the world.\n\nDr. Joseph Bick, the prisons's former chief medical executive and the driving force behind the garden, said that in a place surrounded by death, he wanted to create something restorative, not just for the dying, but also for the volunteers and staff members devoted to their care.\n\nWhat the garden eventually became started with a question to residents: What did they miss? Feedback poured in. They wanted to hear running water and some sort of motion -- inspiration for the trickling fountain and the swinging bench where pastoral care workers rock idly in the shade.\n\nThey wanted something else, too: to remember what it was like to touch grass, something some inmates hadn't done for decades. One day, Dr. Bick recalls, he was planting a tree when he saw a hospice patient approach the garden in his walker. He was near the end. He flipped off his sandals, raised his hands to the sky and gave praise for the simple act of being able to stand in grass.\n\nA Crisis Decades in the Making\n\nJust as the general population in the United States is aging, so too is the population of people who are in prison -- only faster. In 1991, incarcerated people over 50 years old made up just 3 percent of the U.S. prison population, according to a 2025 report by the University of Texas at Austin and the American Civil Liberties Union. Researchers predict that by 2030, that number could reach as much as 30 percent. This is, in part, a result of policy choices: Sentencing practices from the tough-on-crime era of the '80s and '90s have kept people in prison longer.\n\nAt the same time, a growing body of research suggests that prison conditions accelerate the body's aging process, reducing life expectancy by two years for every year behind bars. And with states already spending two to five times as much on incarcerated individuals older than 50 compared to other age groups, a rapidly graying population will further strain the prison system's ability to care for those in their custody.\n\nOne way to address this is compassionate release, which allows people to be released early if they meet certain criteria, such as age or terminal illness. But the process and criteria vary widely by state, and logistical barriers are often so high that people can't get through them, said Dr. Michele DiTomas, medical director of the hospice unit at California Medical Facility.\n\nDr. DiTomas, known around the unit as a tenacious advocate for compassionate release, recalled how, not so long ago, the approval process was convoluted and often took longer than a person had left to live.\n\n\"There's so many places where that system historically fell apart,\" said Dr. DiTomas, who helped create a statewide tracking system so that family members can check the status of compassionate release applications and see where they are stalled.\n\nBut a series of policy changes over the last decade has helped streamline the process. Dr. DiTomas said that California now approves about 100 people a year for compassionate release, up from around 10.\n\nThere are, of course, those opposed to compassionate release who believe that incarcerated people should serve their full sentences, whether or not they are dying. Dr. DiTomas acknowledged this. But she also noted that not all victims favor extreme or harsh sentences. \"Victims aren't a monolith of what they want, and many victims don't want to see that person's family suffer as well,\" she said.\n\nThe Ministry of Presence\n\nWhile the data is murky, it's estimated that less than 5 percent of all state and federal prisons in the United States offer hospice programs. Most people who die in prison stand a good chance of dying alone -- a fate described by current and former inmates as worse than death itself.\n\n\"You're away from everything that's meaningful to you and feel isolated, anonymous, invisible,\" said Fernando Murillo, who spent 24 years in California prisons, including six as a pastoral care worker at California Medical Facility. Today he works as a program manager for the Humane Prison Hospice Project, an organization that uses a curriculum influenced by the one at California Medical Facility to train palliative care workers at other prisons.\n\nAt California Medical Facility, as a patient nears what doctors expect to be the last 48 to 72 hours of his life, a pastoral care worker is assigned to sit vigil so no one dies alone. At a staff meeting in July, Rev. Keith Knauf, a chaplain at the prison and one of the longest-tenured employees on the unit, shared an update on two patients, both of whom had woken up bewildered and frightened, calling out for help. In each case, they were soothed when they saw a pastoral care worker by their side, and fell back asleep.\n\nRev. Knauf said that when it comes time to sit vigil, it isn't about what a person says or does to comfort those who are dying. It's about simply being with them. On the unit they call it the ministry of presence.\n\nTo Allan Krenitsky, a pastoral care worker, accompanying patients during their final moments is one of life's great honors -- one he wasn't always prepared to appreciate. He was just 23 years old in 1988 when he shot and killed a man in his Los Angeles home. Mr. Krenitsky was convicted of murder and sentenced to life without parole.\n\nHe didn't expect to last long in prison. He had been diagnosed with hepatitis C and H.I.V. -- essentially a death sentence in the late '80s. He recalled in gritty detail the segregated unit where he and others with the virus were confined and how they were ostracized. But he also remembered how they cared for their cellmates, changing their diapers or helping them bathe.\n\n\"That left an impression on me,\" he said. \"We understood that one day the people around you would take care of you just like you're taking care of people now.\"\n\nUltimately, Mr. Krenitsky grew up in prison. Medications improved. He started reading and went to college. He married a woman who had been a pen pal and started a family from behind bars. But he still knew deep down that he would one day die in prison.\n\nAnd then, this year, came the unthinkable: A call from Gov. Gavin Newsom telling Mr. Krenitsky his sentence had been commuted and he would go in front of the parole board. His hearing is scheduled for this month.\n\nIf he's released, Mr. Krenitsky won't come out unscathed. He wears a black patch where he lost an eye to infection. But with his easy way and lilting southern drawl, he has become a trusted leader on the unit and proved talented at engaging patients' memories and comforting them as they approach their last breath. For him, it's atonement.\n\n\"It haunts me, but I can never take that back,\" he said of the killing. \"But I can try to be a decent person for the rest of my life.\"\n\nOne day this summer, as the late morning sun poured down on the scorched grass on the hills that seem to stand sentry over the prison, the garden was abuzz with activity. Employees wrapped up a staff meeting and collected their things. Pastoral workers swayed on the swinging bench. Mr. Judson, the lead technician, sat by a man who had been wheeled out in a hospital bed, holding his hand.\n\nMr. Hite, the head gardener, held a fistful of weeds. He takes pride in knowing that the hours he puts into the garden are in service of others, particularly the patients.\n\n\"I think people can see life and death in the plants,\" he said. \"It's solace to their souls to be able to see and be part of that.\"", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/06/us/california-medical-facility-hospice-prison.html"}

Election officials, under the initiative, would be required to verify a voter's citizenship to ensure only legal residents register to vote or receive ballots.\n\nDemocrats historically have opposed voter ID laws over claims it disenfranchises minority voters, while conservatives argue it will ensure only legal residents are able to cast ballots and further bolster voter integrity. Thirty-six states have voter ID laws already on the books, though such laws vary and have some exceptions.\n\nCalifornians for Voter ID leaders, however, say the issue is not a partisan one, but an effort to protect democracy for all Americans.\n\nThe lead strategist for the effort, Ryan Erwin, told Fox News Digital that recent polling shows 70% of Californians across the political spectrum support elections requiring IDs to vote, while underscoring the outpouring of support that has led to more than 500,000 signatures already secured.\n\n\"We are on pace to qualify for the ballot faster than any measure in the history of California,\" Erwin said. \"Voter ID is a commonsense way to build trust in the election process by requiring election officials to use government data to verify citizenship and voter eligibility, while also requiring identification for every vote counted.\"\n\nOBAMA ENDORSES NEWSOM CALIFORNIA REDISTRICTING PROP 50\n\n\"Californians of all political stripes are eager to improve trust in the system by eliminating abuse and errors while protecting every eligible vote,\" he continued. \"The volunteer effort is over-performing, we have signatures from all 58 counties, and are on pace to qualify well ahead of our goal.\"\n\nThe group needs a total of 874,641 in order to land the initiative on the 2026 ballot in the Golden State, but is aiming to secure 1.2 million signatures to ensure the support is certified by county officials who will go through the data before it is permitted to land on the ballot. Organizers have until March to secure the needed signatures before potentially getting on the ballot -- with Strickland reporting he's confident they will get the needed support.\n\n\"You have to be a citizen in order to register to vote,\" Strickland said of the nuts and bolts of the amendment itself, calling it \"very straightforward.\"\n\n\"You have seven forms of documentation, you get to choose what form of documentation that you use in terms of the last four digits of whatever the documentation is,\" he said. \"When you go to the polls, you show your ID, and if you mail in your ballot, you show that proof of the documentation of the last four digits that you choose.\"\n\n\"The other part of this initiative is we have a mandatory audit (to) all 58 counties of their election rules after every election,\" he added.\n\nStrickland is no stranger to voter ID efforts in the deep blue state, including championing a voter ID ballot initiative in Huntington Beach, California, in 2024, when he served on the city council. Voters approved the amendment forcing voters to show their ID when casting ballots in local elections, but the California Court of Appeals struck down the law in November.\n\nIf the statewide voter ID effort is approved by voters on the ballot in 2026, local lawmakers will be compelled to comply with voter ID laws set forth in the initiative.\n\nTRUMP SAYS HE WILL REQUIRE VOTER ID WITH EXECUTIVE ORDER\n\nStrickland said the massive amount of support the initiative already has received is on par with a 1978 initiative, Proposition 13, \"when the legislature was out of touch with the people, the people rose up\" and passed the ballot measure that fundamentally changed how property taxes were assessed and limited in California.\n\nStrickland also compared it to the successful recall of former Democratic Gov. Gray Davis in 2003 -- California's first and only successful recall of a governor. Strickland was the first legislator to endorse Davis' recall as energy and economic woes rocked the state.\n\n\"Speaking around the state of California, I would equate what's going on today with voter ID and voter integrity to those two movements in California,\" he said.\n\nThe California state senator also praised California Republican Assemblyman Carl DeMaio and his group, Reform California, for their ongoing efforts championing voter ID laws in the state, describing DeMaio's work as \"relentless.\" Strickland and DeMaio are joint authors of the voter ID push and have teamed up to meet with voters at various events to rally support, including a recent event in Santa Barbara where the people couldn't get through the door because it was so packed, he said.\n\nVOTER ID LAW IN TEXAS WINS AT APPEALS COURT AFTER BIDEN ADMIN LAWSUIT\n\nCalifornia's voting laws have fallen under the Trump administration's critical eye just this week, with White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt posting to X Tuesday that the Golden State has the \"WORST laws for securing elections in the entire nation.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump said Tuesday that California is facing a \"very serious legal and criminal review\" over claims the state's special election to redraw congressional district lines was mired in corruption. Voters passed the measure to redistrict on Tuesday, with Gov. Gavin Newsom celebrating\n\n\"California doesn't require voters to show photo ID before casting a ballot - despite nearly 90% of Americans supporting photo ID laws,\" Leavitt posted in a lengthy message detailing issues she sees with the state's election process. \"California uses universal mail-in-balloting, which we know is extremely vulnerable to fraud and abuse. In the 2024 election alone, California mailed nearly 10 million mail-in ballots that were never returned.\"\n\nThe Heritage Foundation keeps a database compiling cases of known voter fraud -- namely cases that have led to criminal convictions -- and found California has at least 68 cases of voter fraud since 2001. The examples include individuals who fraudulently used absentee ballots for duplicate votes, non-resident voting, and fraudulent voter registration.\n\nThe database shows other states, such as Illinois and Texas, have more instances of confirmed voting fraud, at more than 100 cases each, while other states such as Nebraska have seen at least three instances of confirmed voter fraud in recent years.\n\nNewsom has countered the claims, arguing California's elections are fair and secure while slamming Trump over his remarks.\n\n\"He also announced today, right when polls were opening, that this election was rigged. Of course, those are familiar words. It's exactly what Donald Trump said after January 6th, that day of love, where he tried to light democracy on fire, he tried to wreck this country,\" Newsom said Tuesday after polling showed the state passed Proposition 50 to redistrict.\n\n\"I hope it's dawning on people the sobriety of this moment,\" Newsom continued. \"What's at stake. Tonight, as I said, is an extraordinary moment for our party, but again, it's an extraordinary moment affirming those principles. Our founding fathers did not live and die to see the kind of vandalism to this republic and our democracy that Donald Trump is trying to perpetuate.\"\n\nFor Strickland, he championed that the voter ID initiative will move ahead with the help of grassroots efforts and a little \"homework.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"I'm going to speak to two groups today, and I give them homework assignments, just saying, 'Please take those packets. We're planning to go get 50 signatures, go get 100.' And I use a sports analogy. I say, in baseball, if you hit two times out of every 10, you're barely making the major leagues. You're probably going down the minor leagues. But if you get three hits every 10, you're an all-star. And I'm asking everybody to get that extra hit in life,\" Strickland said.", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/politics/more-than-500000-californians-demand-voting-overhaul-back-straightforward-id-law"}

She wielded immense power and became a Democratic icon, while she was demonized by conservatives.\n\nRepresentative Nancy Pelosi announced on Thursday that she will retire when her term concludes in early 2027, ending a remarkable career in which she rose to become one of the most powerful women in American history.\n\nMs. Pelosi, 85, was the nation's first and only female House speaker, and she will have represented San Francisco in Congress for 39 years when she leaves office. She has served during an era of seismic change for American society and her own city, from the throes of the AIDS crisis to the legalization of gay marriage, and through the meteoric rise of the tech sector and the nation's extreme polarization.\n\nShe entered political office later in life and became a hero to Democrats for the way she wielded immense power to push Obamacare, climate change legislation and infrastructure programs through Congress.\n\nMs. Pelosi, who likes to use the phrase \"resting is rusting,\" led the House Democrats for 20 years, eight of which she spent as speaker. She has also been a prodigious fund-raiser and raised more than $1.3 billion for Democratic campaigns, according to her aides.\n\nBut she was reviled by conservatives, who painted her as the scary embodiment of liberal San Francisco values and blamed her for what they considered the nation's decline.\n\nShe has been a chief irritant to President Trump, even to this day, calling him \"a vile creature\" in a CNN interview that aired this week. She presided over two of his impeachment trials. And he has called her \"Crazy Nancy,\" with no sense of fondness for his foe.\n\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment on her impending retirement. Neither did several Republicans with whom Ms. Pelosi has clashed over the years.\n\nHer Democratic colleagues said she was unlike any other politician with whom they had worked. Jackie Speier, a Bay Area Democrat who served in the House for 15 years, said that Ms. Pelosi would go down in history \"as the most consequential speaker ever.\"\n\n\"She has a command, a presence. All eyes turn to her,\" Ms. Speier said.\n\nHer retirement had been grist for the local and national political rumor mill for several years, and younger Democrats grew increasingly eager to run for her seat. They feared, however, that it would be folly to challenge one of the most powerful politicians in modern history.\n\nMs. Pelosi, for her part, told CNN days ago that she had no doubt she would win re-election if she were to run for another term.\n\nStill, the overwhelming defeat Democrats suffered last year in the congressional and presidential races has prompted soul-searching within the party -- and louder calls for older Democrats to step down and make way for new politicians with fresh ideas.\n\nThe race to succeed Ms. Pelosi was already shaping up to be a fierce one before she announced her retirement. Scott Wiener, a Democratic state senator from San Francisco who is a champion of housing construction, and Saikat Chakrabarti, who worked as Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's chief of staff, have already announced they were running for the seat -- with or without Ms. Pelosi on the ballot.\n\nIn recent months, Ms. Pelosi has refused to discuss her career plans, insisting she was focused solely on the passage of California's Proposition 50, a ballot measure to approve newly drawn House districts. She worked behind the scenes to help Gov. Gavin Newsom craft the measure, which passed on Tuesday, and to raise money for the effort.\n\nIt was considered one of her final achievements, both a blow to Mr. Trump, who had sought more Republican seats in the House by gerrymandering in conservative states, and a parting gift to the next generation of California Democrats who could benefit from as many as five additional seats in the state.\n\nAt a packed union hall in San Francisco on Monday morning, Ms. Pelosi emceed a Proposition 50 rally that included Mr. Newsom and labor leader Dolores Huerta.\n\n\"This is a moment of truth for America,\" Ms. Pelosi told the crowd. \"It's self-defense for our democracy.\"\n\nIn the audience, union workers wore T-shirts that Ms. Pelosi had autographed for them and pins with drawings of six tiny Nancy Pelosis standing side by side, each wearing a suit in a different color of the rainbow.\n\nAt the rally, the ever-stylish Ms. Pelosi was sporting a green corduroy suit and green stilettos, never mind the fall she took in December on a marble staircase in Luxembourg that forced her to get a hip replacement and remain stuck for several months in dreaded flats.\n\nMs. Pelosi's career in elected office has been a long one, but it did not span even half her life. Born into a politically powerful family of Democrats in Baltimore -- her father and brother each served as the city's mayor -- Ms. Pelosi went the more traditional route for women of her age.\n\nAt first, anyway.\n\nShe met her husband, Paul Pelosi, at Georgetown University, and the couple moved to his hometown, San Francisco, where she stayed home to raise their five children. During that time, Mr. Pelosi grew his career as a venture capitalist.\n\nAs a young mother, Ms. Pelosi found a way to support the Democratic Party by opening up the family's large home for fund-raisers. That led to friendships with a host of prominent San Francisco Democrats in the 1970s and 1980s, including Willie Brown, Jerry Brown and Phil and John Burton, brothers who served in Congress.\n\nHer connections and fund-raising prowess helped her get elected as the first woman to chair the California Democratic Party.\n\nWhen Representative Phil Burton died in office, his wife, Sala Burton, replaced him. Sala Burton was soon after diagnosed with cancer and told Ms. Pelosi she wanted her to run for the seat. Ms. Pelosi, who had shrugged off other suggestions to run for elected office, finally agreed.\n\nA special election was held in June 1987, and Ms. Pelosi, then 47, edged out Harry Britt, a gay socialist who had worked as an aide to Harvey Milk, the San Francisco supervisor who was assassinated at City Hall in 1978.\n\nCleve Jones, who also worked for Mr. Milk and who created the AIDS Memorial Quilt, had backed Mr. Britt. Mr. Jones recalled in an interview that he initially had dismissed Ms. Pelosi as \"a society lady.\"\n\n\"I had the most wrong first impression of Nancy Pelosi,\" he said. \"I just didn't take her very seriously.\"\n\nBut he said his view changed when Ms. Pelosi used her first floor speech in the House to talk about the AIDS crisis as the Reagan administration largely ignored it. That same year, she helped Mr. Jones get his quilt installed on the National Mall in Washington.\n\nIn 1990, she fought for the passage of an act named after Ryan White, a teenager who contracted H.I.V. from a blood transfusion and was banned from his school after his diagnosis. The program paid for health care for H.I.V./AIDS patients who lacked medical coverage.\n\n\"She's just always been there,\" Mr. Jones said. \"She's more than an ally. She's family.\"\n\nBarbara Boxer, who represented a different part of San Francisco in the House and later became a U.S. senator, said in an interview that she and Ms. Pelosi were constantly confused for each other and lumped together as \"the two women from San Francisco.\"\n\nThey bonded by sitting next to each other during countless flights home. Ms. Boxer praised her friend's unique combination of her social justice values, driven by her Catholic faith, and her tactical ability to know every facet of every bill and exactly where each member stood on it.\n\nTogether, they convinced the federal government to dump a plan to turn San Francisco's military base, the Presidio, into condominiums. Instead, the government preserved it as a national park.\n\nKaren Bass, the mayor of Los Angeles who served in Congress alongside Ms. Pelosi, said her colleague was a \"masterful leader\" who listened to widespread dissent in her caucus, but used her smarts and persuasion to repeatedly corral them and win key votes.\n\n\"I was in awe watching her,\" she said.\n\nMs. Pelosi's rise -- and her wins on Capitol Hill -- made her a regular target for conservatives. During the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, some rioters made a beeline for her office, tore down her wooden nameplate and broke into her chambers. One man, who was later prosecuted, was seen sitting in her chair with his feet propped up on her desk in a display of defiance.\n\nThe next year, in October 2022, her husband was brutally attacked in the Pelosi home by a man living in the Bay Area who seemed obsessed with right-wing conspiracy theories.\n\nOn Monday, however, Mr. Pelosi was at the union hall with his wife, appearing healthy.\n\nAt the Proposition 50 rally, Mr. Newsom thanked Ms. Pelosi for her work on the ballot measure.\n\n\"Some people go off and they talk about the way the world should be, but they don't do anything to damn manifest it,\" he said. \"Nancy Pelosi doesn't go out to try to make points. She makes a difference.\"\n\nMs. Pelosi stood behind him, beaming. Then, she exited the stage.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/06/us/politics/nancy-pelosi-house-retire.html"}

Some of those states are also expected to be key House battlegrounds in 2026.\n\nThe early and battleground state count excludes if the state is their home state and does not count multiple visits by the same candidate.\n\n\"Anybody who's looking at the 2028 cycle is starting to head out on the road ... Putting an emphasis on states that could determine control of the House is your best bet, and probably should be your only focus between now and the midterms,\" Sawyer Hackett, a veteran Democratic strategist who worked on presidential campaigns for Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and Julian Castro, told ABC News.\n\n2025 election states: New Jersey, Virginia, California, New York City\n\nIn New Jersey, Democratic candidate and U.S. Rep. Mikie Sherrill received support on the trail from a crowd of presidential hopefuls, including former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, former Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, Arizona Sen. Ruben Gallego, Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly, California Rep. Ro Khanna, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker and Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.\n\nAnd in Virginia, Democratic candidate and former U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger had the support of Beshear, Buttigieg, Emanuel, Gallego, Kelly, Khanna, Moore, Shapiro, and Whitmer.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom, former Vice President Kamala Harris, and Klobuchar separately stumped for \"Proposition 50\" in California, while Khanna and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez stumped for Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani in New York City.\n\nKey early states: Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina\n\nSome of the presidential hopefuls have flocked to states with early nominating contests. The Democratic Party is currently reevaluating its calendar for when those early contests will occur, but Hackett said Democrats hoping to run are still covering their bases.\n\nIowa, which usually boasts first-in-the-nation caucuses, will host a closely watched Senate race next year. The state also has some competitive House seats.\n\nIowa hosted former Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz in March and Buttigieg for a town hall in May, while Gallego visited in August and Emanuel came by in September. Kelly is set to visit in November, while Maryland Sen. Chris Van Hollen spoke to Iowa Democrats in September.\n\nNew Hampshire, which holds the nation's first presidential primaries and will hold a contested U.S. Senate race in 2026 for the seat being vacated by Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, has hosted several lawmakers. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear visited earlier this month; Gallego and Khanna stopped by in August; Klobuchar was there in July and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker will visit in November.\n\nWhen Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker visited in April, he painted a dire picture for his party.\n\n\"Fellow Democrats, for far too long, we've been guilty of listening to a bunch of do-nothing political types who would tell you that America's house is not on fire, even as the flames were licking their faces,\" Pritzker said.\n\nSouth Carolina, meanwhile, also has an early presidential primary. This year, it saw visits from Beshear, Khanna and Newsom in July -- who told rural residents \"what we're experiencing is America in reverse.\"\n\nKelly visited in September, while Maryland Gov. Wes Moore and Walz visited in late May for South Carolina Rep. Jim Clyburn's \"Fish Fry\" event, which has often been fertile waters for would-be Pennsylvania Avenue hopefuls.\n\nBoth Walz and Moore have told ABC News previously they are not \"running\" for president or have no plans to run.\n\nBattleground states: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin\n\nSeveral 2028 presidential hopefuls have also made their way around the seven battleground states, which have been considered winnable by either party and have an outsized influence on where campaigns place their resources.\n\nA few potential candidates have or plan to pay visits to Arizona, including Ocasio-Cortez, who visited in March as part of the Fighting Oligarchy tour run by independent Sen. Bernie Sanders. Whitmer visited in March, while Booker visited in April and Buttigieg visited in October. Harris, who recently said she'll \"possibly\" run for president again, will be speaking there in April 2026.\n\nArizona has two congressional seats currently held by Republicans viewed as competitive, according to the Cook Political Report.\n\nGeorgia is often the site of both a close presidential race and critical down-ballot races. Khanna visited in August, while Harris made a stop there on her book tour in October.\n\nFurther north, Moore and Khanna have paid visits this year to the battleground state of Michigan, where both President Donald Trump and Democratic Senate candidate Elissa Slotkin won in 2024.\n\nPennsylvania is also a key battleground state. Moore delivered a commencement address at Lincoln University in Gettysburg in May, the same month Gallego and Khanna paid their own visits. Notably, two Republicans in Pennsylvania, Reps. Scott Perry and Ryan Mackenzie, are expecting to face fierce fights to hold onto their seats.\n\nKhanna recently said the party's focus is to win back control of the House, which has a Republican majority.\n\n\"We have already a number of great candidates for 2028 that'll emerge, but right now the focus has to be to take back the House in terms of political priority,\" Khanna told public media organization WHYY.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/2028-presidential-hopefuls-flock-key-battleground-states-traveled/story?id=126909684"}

It has also torpedoed the first-ever global fee on carbon pollution in the shipping industry. President Trump lectured world leaders at the United Nations in September, telling them if they did not \"get away from this green scam, your country is going to fail.\"\n\nLaurence Tubiana, who has served as France's climate negotiator and now runs the European Climate Foundation, a research organization, said she has been shocked by the \"level of aggressiveness\" with which Mr. Trump and his cabinet secretaries have opposed Europe's climate goals.\n\nThat has prompted some to say discussions could go more smoothly in Brazil without the United States, even though U.S. delegates have played a central role in designing climate agreements over three decades and the country arguably bears special responsibility as the world's biggest polluter in historical terms.\n\nUnited Nations climate summits require consensus, so one country can crater an entire agreement. That's led some to fear that a team from the Trump administration could block even incremental progress in Bel\u00e9m.\n\n\"We are really concerned about the potential damage that can come from the U.S. delegation,\" said Alejandra L\u00f3pez Carbajal, a former climate negotiator for a group of Latin American countries who now leads climate diplomacy for Transforma, a research organization based in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia.\n\nUnder the 2015 Paris climate agreement, the United States and 197 other countries made voluntary pledgesUnited States and 197 other countries in a voluntarily pledge to hold average global temperature rise to \"well below\" 2 degrees Celsius, and preferably closer to 1.5 degrees, compared to preindustrial levels. The world has already warmed about 1.3 degrees Celsius.\n\nEvery fraction of a degree of additional warming could mean tens of millions more people worldwide exposed to dangerous heat waves, wildfires, water and food shortages, and coastal flooding, scientists have said.\n\nAt the gathering that starts Thursday at the edge of the Amazon in Bel\u00e9m, countries are expected to deliver new, more ambitious plans to cut the carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases they emit.\n\nMs. Tubiana said the rest of the world would persevere without the Americans. From here on out, she said, \"we have to act with or without the U.S.\"\n\nThis year's summit is set to begin with two days of speeches from heads of state and government, followed by about two weeks of negotiations among foreign ministers and other senior diplomats from about 140 countries.\n\nNot only is the White House not sending high level representatives, it may not send any technical staff, either. It has been clear for months that Mr. Trump, who is withdrawing the United States from the Paris Agreement, never seriously considered making an appearance.\n\n\"President Trump will not jeopardize our country's economic and national security to pursue vague climate goals that are killing other countries,\" said Taylor Rogers, a White House spokeswoman, echoing language Mr. Trump used at the United Nations General Assembly in September, when he claimed that countries pursuing clean energy \"would fail.\"\n\nThe pullout of the Americans, and the vacuum that has created, may be one reason some world leaders are skipping the climate talks this year. Those expected to stay home include Anthony Albanese of Australia; Xi Jinping of China; Vladimir V. Putin of Russia; Sanae Takaichi of Japan; Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey; Prabowo Subianto of Indonesia and Pope Leo.\n\nStill, a group of about 100 American leaders, mostly Democratic state and local officials, is expected in Brazil to send a message that mayors, governors and business leaders still prioritize climate change even if Mr. Trump does not. Gov. Gavin Newsom of California, a Democrat who has emerged as President Trump's chief antagonist, announced on Wednesday that he would attend the talks in Bel\u00e9m.\n\n\"As the president of the United States turns his back on people and the planet, California is inking global partnerships focused on creating jobs and cutting toxic pollution,\" Mr. Newsom said in a statement.\n\nSeveral big companies -- including GE Vernova, Bank of America and Bayer -- also will be on the ground, said Marty Durbin, who leads the energy institute at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n\n\"The business community hasn't walked away from this, even with the Trump administration minimizing it and pulling out,\" Mr. Durbin said.\n\nBecause of the federal government shutdown, some Democratic lawmakers may pay their own way to attend as part of the Sustainable Energy and Environment Caucus, said Max Frankel, director of the nonprofit arm of the caucus. Other members of Congress, including Senator John Curtis, a Utah Republican, have said they were forced to cancel their plans for Bel\u00e9m entirely.\n\nThe absence of an official American delegation is a departure from previous Republican administrations.\n\nIn 2001 the United States withdrew from the Kyoto Protocol, the world's first global climate agreement, which had been signed three years earlier by President Bill Clinton. But the George W. Bush administration still participated in annual talks.\n\nAnd even when Mr. Trump first withdrew from the Paris Agreement, during his first term in 2017, he continued to send high ranking State Department officials to the U.N. climate summits to at least nod toward the need to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nIn the ensuing years, during which President Joseph R. Biden Jr. returned the United States to the Paris accord, Mr. Trump's hostility to all things related to climate hardened. Now surrounded by loyalists, Mr. Trump has also declared that he seeks fossil fuels dominant globally, and he attacks any policies that could harm U.S. coal, oil or gas interests.\n\nMr. Trump has signed multiple trade deals that require Japan, Korea, the European Union and other trading partners to buy billions of dollars worth of gas from the United States.\n\nIn August the Trump administration aligned with Saudi Arabia to scuttle an international limit on the production of plastics, which are made from petroleum. Last month the United States and Qatar joined forces to oppose European Union sustainability rules that require companies to identify and address the adverse environmental impacts of their actions.\n\nThat came on the heels of what is perhaps the Trump administration's greatest anti-climate triumph: joining Saudi Arabia and Russia to thwart what would have been the first-ever global fee on shipping emissions. Trump administration officials openly threatened countries with tariffs and levies if they supported the carbon fee and later boasted of having deployed an \"all hands on deck\" pressure campaign.\n\nSome argue the fear of maneuvering by the United States to impede climate talks is overblown. For one thing, there's almost no one remaining in the State Department who knows the intricate U.N. process, since many employees were fired, reassigned or accepted offers to leave the government.\n\nUnder U.N. rules, the United States is still technically a party to the Paris Agreement until Jan. 27. It also remains a member of the U.N. body that convenes nations annually to monitor global progress on tackling climate change.\n\nConservatives and others who oppose efforts to address climate change also want the United States to stay away from Bel\u00e9m.\n\nSeventeen Republican attorneys general, led by John McCuskey of West Virginia, sent a letter to the administration last month arguing that sending a delegation \"would do little more than lend credibility\" to the global climate talks.\n\n\"At a time when demand for energy is greater than ever, the prior administration embraced COP policies that dismantled -- rather than supported -- coal, oil, and gas production,\" the attorneys general wrote. \"The COP and other international actors favor less reliable and more expensive renewable energy sources, and that preference has proven harmful to American energy stability.\"\n\nSenator Jim Justice, a West Virginia Republican whose family owns several coal companies, said he did not have a strong position on whether the United States should take part in the talks. But with energy demand rising, in part because of the rapid growth of data centers, a transition away from fossil fuels threatens American security, he said.\n\n\"We know that we're going to have an energy meltdown in this country and we have got to have our fossil fuels today like crazy,\" Mr. Justice said. \"If you knew you had to have your fossil fuels like crazy would it make sense to go to a climate change summit? Maybe not.\"", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/06/climate/belem-brazi-cop30-trump.html"}

Gavin Newsom that will redraw the state's congressional districts to be more favorable to Democrats ahead of next year's midterm elections following a similar redistricting push in Texas that favors Republicans.\n\nSan Joaquin County election numbers as of Wednesday afternoon show 53% of voters said \"yes\" to Proposition 50, siding with Democrats in the push to approve the measure. In last year's election, voters in the county aligned with Republicans, with 48.9% voting for Mr. Trump over 48.0% for Harris.\n\nUnited Farmworkers spokesperson Antonio De Loera said the Latino population, the largest demographic in the county, is making all the difference in the outcome of recent elections there.\n\n\"Latino voters are swing voters now,\" he said.\n\nDe Loera said the San Joaquin County vote for Mr. Trump a year ago was about the economy, an issue he said the president is no longer winning with Latinos now.\n\n\"One of the big stories in the 2024 election was that Donald Trump and Republicans did in fact make big gains with Latinos,\" he said. \"Those gains have clearly not been permanent.

The gambit was an exercise in political power and, coming outside of the traditional decennial redistricting process, without precedent in modern history.\n\nYet if Democrats feared not long ago that they would be locked out of a House majority, their decisive victories across the country last night have made them, arguably, the favorites heading into next year's midterm elections.\n\nIn California, an overwhelming majority voted to redistrict, essentially canceling out the five House seats that Republicans had thought they gained through redistricting in Texas over the summer. The GOP's steep losses farther east cast even more doubt on the wisdom of its redistricting push. Voters repudiated Republicans virtually across the board, handing Democrats convincing victories for the governorships of New Jersey and Virginia, important judicial and legislative races in Pennsylvania, and, for the first time in two decades, a pair of statewide elections in Georgia. In Virginia, the breadth of the Democrats' win gave them their largest majority in the state House of Delegates since 1989.\n\nRead: The anti-MAGA majority reemerges\n\nFor Democrats, the results were reminiscent of -- and in many cases stronger than -- the victories they posted during the 2017 elections, in Trump's first term, which presaged the wave that delivered them the House majority a year later. Even if the GOP's gerrymandering advantage nets the party a few additional seats, Democrats will have a narrower gap to overcome next year than they did eight years ago.\n\nAmong the constituencies that swung the hardest toward Democrats yesterday were Latinos, who helped power Trump's presidential win last year and were key to the GOP's redrawn congressional map in Texas. The Republicans' chances of flipping five additional House seats there rest in part on their holding Trump's gains among Latino voters. That was a questionable assumption from the start, the longtime GOP strategist Mike Madrid told me. It appears even shakier in light of Tuesday's election results; in New Jersey, for example, the state's three most heavily Latino counties moved sharply back to the left after swinging toward Trump in 2024.\n\n\"None of this is good for Republicans. It's all their own doing, though,\" Madrid said. Latinos in Texas border towns may vote differently in 2026 than Latinos in New Jersey did this year. But the anti-GOP shift in this week's elections could boost the Democrats' chances of winning two and possibly three of the five Texas seats that Republicans redrew in their favor, Madrid told me. It could also open up even more opportunities for Democrats, because to create the additional red-leaning seats, Republicans had to cut into previously safe GOP districts. \"The problem is they're spreading their other districts thin as they're getting greedy,\" Madrid said.\n\nYesterday's election results could complicate both parties' plans to escalate their gerrymandering tit-for-tat across the country. In addition to their Texas effort, Republicans have enacted newly drawn congressional maps in Missouri and North Carolina that could yield them an additional House seat in each state. Florida legislators are eyeing a gerrymander that could boost the GOP's chances in multiple seats, although the state's significant proportion of Latino voters could pose similar redistricting challenges for Republicans there as those in Texas saw.\n\nInternal opposition, however, has slowed the GOP's drive elsewhere. Ohio Republicans cut a deal with Democrats on revised districts that are more favorable for the GOP but not nearly as aggressive as some party leaders had advocated for. In Indiana, Republicans remain short of the votes they would need in the state legislature to gerrymander both of its House Democrats out of their seats, despite an intense pressure campaign from the White House. And just as polls were closing in eastern states last night, Kansas Republicans announced that they lacked support to call a special legislative session to redraw the House seat of Representative Sharice Davids, the lone Democrat in the state's congressional delegation.\n\nSome Democrats, meanwhile, were emboldened by the success of California's Proposition 50, the ballot measure devised by Governor Gavin Newsom that temporarily redraws the state congressional map to target five Republican-held House seats and strengthen five additional swing districts represented by Democrats. With 75 percent of precincts reporting today, the referendum was leading by more than 25 points. (Republicans immediately filed a lawsuit to block the new California maps, as they had promised to do if Prop 50 passed.) The GOP's \"biggest strategy for trying to steal the 2026 election is falling apart before their eyes,\" Ken Martin, the chair of the Democratic National Committee, told reporters on a conference call trumpeting the party's electoral wins.\n\nEven before Democrats swept Virginia's elections last night, the party's state legislative majorities began a two-year process to gerrymander two or three Republicans out of their House seats in the 2026 elections. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries has pushed Democratic leaders in Illinois and Maryland to similarly redraw their state's congressional maps. But the effort has met resistance from some Democratic lawmakers.\n\nIn Maryland, the state Senate president, Bill Ferguson, used the party's electoral success yesterday to argue against an attempt to draw a new map that would likely give Democrats all eight of its House seats. (Republicans currently hold one.) \"Tonight's resounding Democratic victory shows we don't need to rig the system to win,\" Ferguson wrote on X. His comment earned a sharp rebuttal from his counterpart in neighboring Virginia, the state Senate president pro tempore, L. Louise Lucas. \"Get our victory in Virginia out of your mouth while you echo MAGA talking points,\" she posted this afternoon. \"Grow a pair and stand up to this President. This is just embarrassing.\"\n\nRead: 'California is allowed to hit back'\n\nMartin said he hoped Tuesday's election results, and especially the Prop 50 vote in California, would \"send a chilling effect to Republicans\" who are trying to gerrymander more states. \"It's not going to net you enough seats to guarantee that you're going to control the U.S. House next year,\" he said. \"So knock it off now.\"\n\nThere was no signal from Republicans that they planned to abandon their efforts. Although Trump voiced disappointment in the election results, other party leaders dismissed them. \"There's no surprises. What happened last night was blue states and blue cities voted blue,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters outside the Capitol. \"Off-year elections are not indicative of what's to come.\" (The speaker had a different interpretation of the off-year elections four years ago, when they went the GOP's way: \"RED WAVE is coming,\" Johnson posted then.)\n\nOne GOP strategist, who was granted anonymity to candidly assess the party's performance, told me that yesterday's results were \"a wake-up call.\" But the strategist said Republicans remained \"full-steam ahead\" on their redistricting push in Florida.\n\nMadrid said the elections should send each party a message on redistricting. Republicans should \"pause and stop and contemplate. Say, 'Wait a second. Maybe we made a mistake here.'\" At the same time, Democrats should understand, he said, that they can win elections at the ballot box without sacrificing the moral high ground on gerrymandering. Madrid wasn't optimistic, however: \"There's a lesson for both parties in this, and neither one of them will learn it.\"", "url": "https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/2025/11/trumps-gerrymandering-war-stalled/684833/"}

Trump pumps his fist while exiting the stage during the American Business Forum at the Kaseya Center in Miami on Wednesday, Nov. 5, 2025. (Carl Juste/Miami Herald/Tribune News Service via Getty Images) Miami Herald\n\nFIFA President Gianni Infantino has once again hailed \"close friend\" President Trump, while also hinting that FIFA will award the U.S. political chief its inaugural \"Peace\" prize at the World Cup draw in Washington D.C. in December.\n\nIn a passionate defence of President Trump's performance since returning to the White House, Infantino also hailed him as a man who \"says what many people think\" and said he could not understand \"negative comments.\"\n\nInfantino was speaking at the America Business Forum in Miami on Wednesday, as part of a remarkable line-up which included Trump and Lionel Messi.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, FIFA announced the introduction of its \"FIFA Peace Prize - Football Unites the World.\" They said this would reward individuals who have taken exceptional and extraordinary actions for peace and those who have united people across the world.\n\nTrump has claimed to have ended eight wars since returning to power in January but was famously overlooked for the Nobel Peace Prize, which instead went to Maria Corina Macaho, a Venezuelan opposition figurehead who has opposed the regime of Nicolas Maduro. She spoke at the conference in Miami on Wednesday morning via videolink, a couple of hours before Trump's appearance.\n\nWhen FIFA announced the new award on Wednesday, they did not say who the recipient would be but the announcement corresponded with Infantino and Trump speaking at the same conference in Miami. The description FIFA provided also fits the framing of Trump that he and his allies wish the world to know, as well as the 'President of Peace' moniker he has bestowed upon himself.\n\nTrump's speech on Wednesday lunchtime marked a year since he won the Presidential election last November. His speech reeled off the achievements he says he has made, notably the release of Israeli hostages and a peace plan for Gaza, but also took aim at new and former rivals.\n\n\"This is the golden age of America,\" Trump began, before admonishing his predecessor \"crooked Joe Biden\", who he also described as \"Sleepy Joe.\"\n\nHe then moved onto another former U.S. president, Barack Obama, placing emphasis when saying Obama's middle name Hussein and describing him as a \"mean person and a divider.\"\n\nHe then referred to California governor Gavin Newsom as \"Gavin Newscum.\" He also criticized the newly-elected New York City mayor Zohran Mamdani, describing him as a communist - Mamdani describes himself as a democratic socialist - and said that Miami would be a \"refuge\" for those fleeing communism from New York.\n\nHe once again attacked the involvement of transgender athletes in women's sports, claiming that Mamdani \"or whatever the hell his name is\", takes a more liberal position on the matter.\n\nInfantino was among the audience at the Kaseya Center and he only appeared effusive during President Trump's speech. Infantino gave a thumbs up as Trump explained how he was only in his first term as leader when the United bid for Canada, Mexico and the United States secured the 2026 World Cup.\n\n\"So when they rigged the election,\" Trump alleged, repeating his disproven claim about his 2020 defeat to Biden. \"I said I have to run again because I want to be President when they have the World Cup.\" The cameras showed Infantino laughing along.\n\nTrump described Infantino as \"a big star.\" He added: \"The tickets are selling at numbers and records like never before. (Gianni) says they are doing record business.\"\n\nTrump did not stay for Infantino's speech later in the afternoon. That, however, did not see Infantino hold back during a fervent defense and endorsement of the U.S. president.\n\nInfantino said: \"We have a great relationship. I'm really lucky. I have a great relationship with President Trump, where I consider him a really close friend. Of course he's being very helpful in everything we are doing for the World Cup. He is really engaged. He has such incredible energy and this is something that I really admire.\n\n\"He does things. He does what he says. He says what he thinks. He actually says what many people think as well, but maybe don't dare to say and that's why he's so successful. I have to say it and I'm a bit surprised sometimes when we read some negative comments. I am not American, but as far as I understand, President Trump was elected in the United States of America and was quite clearly elected. When you are in such a great democracy as the United States of America, you should first of all respect the results of the election, right? In the end he was elected based on the programme, based on what he said. He is just implementing what he said he would do. So I think we should all support what he's doing because I think it's looking pretty good.\"\n\nInfantino went on to explain that the reason behind the new award, which will be awarded to a recipient at the Kennedy Center at the World Cup draw next month, Since returning as president, Trump has also taken over the Kennedy Center, installing himself as chair and filling a previously bi-partisan board with his allies. The Athletic has previously reported how FIFA had been in advanced conversations with venues to host the draw in Las Vegas, only for FIFA to follow the wishes of the Trump administration by instead plumping for the Kennedy Center. Trump is expected to be in attendance for the draw.\n\n\"Our motto in FIFA is that football or soccer unites and that it brings people together from the entire planet,\" Infantino said. \"When we see what is happening in our world today. which is a very divided world, we need to find more occasions to bring people together, because when these people come together, they speak to each other, they understand each other. We believe that peace in the world is something which is so important.\n\n\"We have to support it because it's about unity and we have to support anyone who is doing something special. So we thought we have to bring to life the FIFA Peace Prize. The first edition will be happening this year with the awarding of the 5th of December in Washington, D.C., on the occasion of the draw for the World Cup, because we will have a global audience with 1 billion people watching the draw. This is the right platform to award somebody who has done so much or is doing so much for peace, because we need that. Football helps a little bit, but then we need leaders who push it into the goal.\"", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6781983/2025/11/05/gianni-infantino-president-trump-fifa-world-cup-peace/"}

The Democratic redraw of congressional maps actually made her district safer for Republicans than it was before -- which also made it an attractive life raft.\n\nThat means two veteran G.O.P. incumbents will vie for one House seat in a clash that underscores how dire the stakes have become for Republicans in California. It also shows how the redistricting war has sent incumbents scrambling in the middle of the decade, in a way that unlucky members usually only do after a new census.\n\n\"It's a game of musical chairs, and a bunch of chairs just got taken away from the game,\" said Rob Stutzman, a Republican strategist based in Sacramento. \"So they're going to be competing for what's left.\"\n\nIt is possible that other vulnerable Republicans could seek safer territory occupied by their colleagues rather than run in their redrawn districts. House candidates are not required to live in the districts they represent, as long as they live in the same state.\n\nPolitical strategists have speculated that Representative Kevin Kiley, a Sacramento-area Republican, could challenge Representative Tom McClintock, who holds a safe Republican seat that will now stretch across largely rural Sierra Nevada counties. If Mr. Kiley were to stay in his current district, he would have to face Representative Ami Bera, a Democrat from Sacramento who announced Wednesday that he would run for Mr. Kiley's redrawn seat.\n\nMr. Kiley said on Wednesday that he was not sure yet where he would run next year.\n\nNear the southern border, Representative Darrell Issa, a Republican who has an inland San Diego County district, is not far from the new 40th District that Mr. Calvert and Ms. Kim will fight over. Mr. Issa, who would be vulnerable if he stayed in his current district, wrote on Tuesday that he was \"not going anywhere,\" without specifying where he would run.\n\nMr. Calvert on Wednesday suggested that he actually had the closest ties to the newly configured 40th District, which includes the easternmost parts of Orange County and the westernmost parts of Riverside County. Mr. Calvert lives in the city of Corona, a spokesman for his campaign said, which is in the new district.\n\nHis campaign had data at the ready showing that just over 50 percent of voters in the district were part of his old 41st District in Riverside, compared with 32 percent in Ms. Kim's former district and 15 percent in the old district of Mr. Issa.\n\n\"No one else comes close to my record of service to the new 40th,\" Mr. Calvert said in a statement, without mentioning Ms. Kim by name. \"I've lived here my entire life and already represent the majority of this district in Congress.\"\n\nMs. Kim made clear in her own statement on Wednesday that she was running for re-election and, in a sign she was prepared to fight, said she was booking a multimillion-dollar ad buy that would start in April. Like Mr. Calvert, she did not mention her opponent in her statement and kept the focus on blasting the redistricting ballot measure, Proposition 50, which was crafted by Gov. Gavin Newsom and other state Democrats.\n\n\"These failed career politicians made partisan deals behind closed doors to redraw districts in ways that help themselves and their allies instead of the voters,\" she wrote.\n\nMr. Calvert, who has served in the House since 1993, has long been a top target for Democrats, but survived countless challenges. Ms. Kim, a third-term congresswoman who lives in Anaheim, within the new 40th District, is also battle-tested. After narrowly losing her first bid for a House seat in 2018 to Representative Gil Cisneros, a Democrat, she ousted him two years later in another close race. (Mr. Cisneros returned to the House this year after winning a different district.)\n\nShe has been a target for Democrats ever since, but the new congressional map likely put the reconfigured 40th District out of reach for the party. Democrats removed conservative areas from the districts they had hoped to flip, then added them to the 40th District to concentrate Republican votes there.\n\nThat has not dissuaded Democratic candidates from running for the district; among the entrants are Christina Gagnier, a school district member; Joe Kerr, a retired firefighter; Lisa Ramirez, an immigration lawyer; and Esther Kim Varet, a prominent art dealer.\n\nMs. Ramirez and Ms. Kim Varet both said on Wednesday that they planned to stay in the race. Ms. Kim Varet said that although it would be an uphill battle, she thought Mr. Calvert and Ms. Kim might hurt each other enough to help her own campaign.\n\n\"These two people that are bloodying themselves up, they're old,\" said Ms. Kim Varet, who has raised $2 million. \"I'm a millennial -- they're part of the old guard. There is a reckoning coming of old politicians, and old Trump politicians makes it even worse.\"\n\nMr. Stutzman suggested that it was not all doom-and-gloom for Republicans. Several of the newly competitive districts could still go for his party, he said, and he argued that Republicans had a shot at flipping the Central Valley seat held by Representative Adam Gray, a Democrat who got a boost from the new map.\n\n\"They're not going to hang heads,\" he said. \"They're going to go fight for what's left.\"", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/05/us/politics/house-election-ken-calvert-young-kim.html"}

In it, Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer, New York Democrat, is shown speaking words from a print interview about the government shutdown, an innovation that changes campaigns forever.\n\nThe ad was posted Oct. 17 on the Senate Republican X account. \"Week 3 of the Schumer Shutdown,\" the text states, followed by a quote Mr. Schumer gave to Punchbowl News last month. \"Every day,\" the New York Democrat said, \"gets better for us.\"\n\nIn the lower right-hand corner of the commercial, under the NRSC logo, is a box reading \"AI Generated.\" The gray transparency is easy to miss because the viewer's attention is, by design, fixed on Mr. Schumer. More than 1.8 million people have watched the 30-second spot on X alone.\n\nThe commercial begins with the deepfake of Mr. Schumer. \"Chuck Schumer,\" a narrator says, \"thinks playing with Americans' livelihoods is just a game. When asked about the government shutdown, Schumer said ...\" and the altered clip repeats as a wide, Cheshire Cat grin spreads across the senator's face.\n\n\"Really, Chuck?\" the narrator asks. \"How's that?\" The ad cuts to clips outlining the shutdown's costs, including stress on military families, \"control towers shutting down\" at airports and \"critical food assistance\" lapsing \"for low-income women, infants and children.\" After a remark that \"the pain is going to increase on the American people,\" Sen. Ted Cruz, Texas Republican, says it's \"because [the Democrats] want free, government-provided health care for illegal aliens.\" The ad concludes with the narrator saying, \"The Schumer Shutdown is making things worse across America, and Democrats love it.\"\n\nA traditional ad would have driven home the point by reading Mr. Schumer's quote, but the AI-generated video has far greater impact.\n\nMr. Schumer explained to Punchbowl that Democrats \"knew that health care would be the focal point\" of the shutdown and \"prepared for it.\" He predicted that Republicans thought they would \"threaten us, bamboozle us, and we would submit in a day or two.\" It was here where Mr. Schumer said that \"every day gets better for us\" and \"every time\" Republicans \"try something, it doesn't quite work.\" The Republican Party has since failed to peel off enough Democratic senators to reach the 60-vote threshold required to break their filibuster.\n\nThe quote used in the ad illustrates Mr. Schumer's strategy even without the added context, and short quotes or quotes broken up by ellipses are standard political fare. Some have been used to create false impressions of their own, such as an infamous AFL-CIO \"Medi-scare\" commercial used against Speaker Newt Gingrich in 1995.\n\nThe 1995 commercial featured a senior citizen praising Medicare. It then cut to Mr. Gingrich saying that Republicans wouldn't \"get rid of it in round one\" but believed \"it's going to wither on the vine because we think people are voluntarily going to leave it.\" Mr. Gingrich's full remarks show that \"it\" didn't refer to Medicare but to the Health Care Financing Administration, which oversees the program. Judging that the bureaucracy was inefficient based on complaints, Republicans felt they could offer a better alternative.\n\nAI allows the creation of ads that are even more deceptive. Politicians can be shown saying anything with visual details that add subtext. These can be facial cues, such as Mr. Schumer's grin, or unkempt attire, bloodshot eyes and a sweaty upper lip. The only limit is the creator's imagination.\n\nLegislation to regulate manipulated ads has run afoul of the First Amendment. In July, California Gov. Gavin Newsom said an altered video on X featuring Vice President Kamala Harris ought to be \"illegal.\" Mr. Newsom signed the Defending Democracy From Deepfake Deception Act, but a federal judge voided it. The governor has since leaned into AI, posting an image of MAGA singer Kid Rock appearing to offer an endorsement.\n\nAbsent regulations that pass constitutional muster, deepfakes in political commercials are here to stay now that Senate Republicans have broken the taboo. Citizens are advised to be on guard, because although Mr. Schumer's position on the shutdown may not get better every day, AI technology does.", "url": "https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2025/nov/5/republicans-break-taboo-ai-campaign-ads/"}

But just beneath the party's relief at securing its first big electoral wins since last November's drubbing lay unresolved questions about its direction heading into next year's midterm elections.\n\nThe Election Day romp of Republicans stretched from deep-blue New York and California to swing-states Georgia, Pennsylvania and Virginia. There were signs that key voting groups, including young people, Black voters and Hispanics who shifted toward President Donald Trump's Republican Party just a year ago, may be shifting back. And Democratic leaders across the political spectrum coalesced behind a simple message focused on Trump's failure to address rising costs and everyday kitchen table issues.\n\nThe dominant performance sparked a new round of debate among the party's establishment-minded pragmatists and fiery progressives over which approach led to Tuesday's victories, and which path to take into the high-stakes 2026 midterm elections and beyond. The lessons Democrats learn from the victories will help determine the party's leading message and messengers next year -- when elections will decide the balance of power in Congress for the second half of Trump's term -- and potentially in the 2028 presidential race, which has already entered its earliest stages.\n\n\"Of course, there's a division within the Democratic Party. There's no secret,\" Sen. Bernie Sanders told reporters at a Capitol Hill press conference about the election results.\n\nSanders and his chief political strategist pointed to the success of New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, a democratic socialist, as a model for Democrats across the country. But Rep. Suzan Del Bene, who leads the House Democrats' midterm campaign strategy, avoided saying Mamdani's name when asked about his success.\n\nDel Bene instead cheered the moderate approach adopted by Democrats Abigail Spanberger and Mikie Sherrill in successful races for governor in Virginia and New Jersey as a more viable track for candidates outside of a Democratic stronghold like New York City.\n\n\"New York is bright blue ... and the path to the majority in the House is going to be through purple districts,\" she told The Associated Press. \"The people of Arizona, Iowa and Nebraska aren't focused on the mayor of New York.\"\n\nPennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, a likely Democratic presidential prospect who campaigned alongside Democrats in several states leading up to Tuesday's elections, noted the candidates hit on a common issue that resonated with voters, regardless of location.\n\n\"All of these candidates who won in these different states were focused on peoples' everyday needs,\" Shapiro said. \"And you saw voters in every one of those states and cities showing up to send a clear message to Donald Trump that they're rejecting his chaos.\"\n\nAmid Democrats' celebratory phone calls and news conferences, members of the party's different wings had some sharp critiques for each other.\n\nWhile Shapiro cheered the party's success during a Wednesday interview, he also acknowledged concerns about Mamdani in New York.\n\nShapiro, one of the nation's most prominent Jewish elected leaders, said he's not comfortable with some of Mamdani's comments on Israel. The New York mayor-elect, a Muslim, has described Israel's response to the Oct. 7 attacks as \"genocide\" against the Palestinian people and has been slow to condemn rhetoric linked to anti-Semitism.\n\n\"I've expressed that to him personally. We've had good private communications,\" Shapiro said of his concerns. \"And I hope, as he did last night in his victory speech, that he'll be a mayor that protects all New Yorkers and tries to bring people together.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Sanders' political strategist, Faiz Shakir, warned Democrats against embracing \"cookie cutter campaigns that say nothing and do nothing\" -- a reference to centrist Democrats Spanberger and Sherrill.\n\nDespite potential cracks in the Democratic coalition, it's hard to understate the extent of the party's electoral success.\n\nIn Georgia, two Democrats cruised to wins over Republican incumbents in elections to the state Public Service Commission, delivering the largest statewide margins of victory by Democrats in more than 20 years.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, Democrats swept not only three state Supreme Court races, but every county seat in presidential swing counties like Bucks and Erie Counties, including sheriffs. Bucks County elected its first Democratic district attorney as Democrats there also won key school board races and county judgeships.\n\nMaine voters defeated a Republican-backed measure that would have mandated showing an ID at the polls. Colorado approved raising taxes on people earning more than $300,000 annually to fund school meal programs and food assistance for low-income state residents. And California voters overwhelmingly backed a charge led by Gov. Gavin Newsom to redraw its congressional map to give Democrats as many as five more House seats in upcoming elections.\n\nTrump made inroads with Black and Hispanic voters in 2024. But this week, Democrats scored strong performances with non-white voters in New Jersey and Virginia that offered promise.\n\nAbout 7 in 10 voters in New Jersey were white, according to the AP Voter Poll. And Sherrill won about half that group. But she made up for her relative weakness with whites with a strong showing among Black, Hispanic and Asian voters.\n\nThe vast majority -- about 9 in 10 -- of Black voters supported Sherrill, as did about 8 in 10 Asian voters.\n\nHispanic voters in New Jersey were more divided, but about two-thirds supported Sherrill; only about 3 in 10 voted for the Republican nominee, Jack Ciattarelli.\n\nThe pattern was similar in Virginia, where Spanberger performed well among Black voters, Hispanic voters and Asian voters, even though she didn't win a majority of white voters.\n\nThe debate over the party's future is already starting to play out in key midterm elections where Democrats have just begun intra-party primary contests.\n\nThe choice is stark in Maine's high-stakes Senate race, where Democrats will pick from a field that features establishment favorite, Gov. Jan Mills, and Sanders-endorsed populist Graham Platner. A similar dynamic could play out in key contests across Massachusetts, New York, Texas and Michigan.\n\nMichigan Democratic Senate candidate Abdul El-Sayed, who is aligned with the progressive wing of the party, said the people he speaks to are demanding bold action to address their economic concerns.\n\n\"Folks are so frustrated by how hard its become to afford a dignified life here in Michigan and across the country,\" he said.\n\n\"I'm sure the corporate donors don't want us to push too hard,\" El-Sayed continued. \"My worry is the very same people who told us we were just fine in 2024 will miss the mandate.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press reporter Mike Catalini in Newark and Joey Cappelletti in Washington contributed.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/democrats-hopeful-unresolved-questions-remain-partys-path-forward-127237705"}

Before joining CBS News in 2025, he worked at KTLA, the San Jose Mercury News, the Sedona Red Rock News and various other outlets as a freelance sports reporter.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom's Proposition 50 initiative will knock at least one prominent California Republican out of Congress, as two of them each announced their candidacies for the new 40th congressional district on Wednesday.\n\nRep. Ken Calvert, a congressional mainstay for more than 30 years, announced Wednesday will attempt to remain in Congress with a run in the newly drawn 40th Congressional District. Hours later, Rep. Young Kim said she'll run for re-election in the same district, setting up a showdown between the two Republicans in the 2026 midterm elections.\n\nThe announcements come on the heels of the projected passage of Proposition 50, the off-cycle redistricting initiative spearheaded by Gov. Gavin Newsom. A CBS News projection on Wednesday afternoon showed that 63.8% of voters backed the proposition.\n\nThe new 40th congressional district will effectively split Corona in half and span from the easternmost cities of Orange County, like Villa Park and Mission Viejo, across the Inland Empire to Murrieta and Menifee.\n\nCalvert, a vocal critic of the initiative, currently represents California's 41st congressional district. The district currently covers parts of the Inland Empire, but will be redrawn to span parts of western Orange County and southeast Los Angeles County.\n\nThe Corona native now seeks to remain in the House of Representatives, where he has been in office since 1992.\n\n\"The newly drawn 40th District is where I was born and raised,\" Calvert said in a statement. \"I've had the honor of serving the overwhelming majority of these communities and delivering results for both Riverside and Orange Counties.\"\n\nCalvert will potentially face a reality he hasn't dealt with much in his 30-plus years in Congress -- a competitive electoral challenge.\n\nKim, of Anaheim Hills, has represented the 40th congressional district since 2023. The 63-year-old immigrated from South Korea as a teenager, and like Calvert, is a staunch supporter of President Trump.\n\n\"I am running for re-election in California's 40th district. Gavin Newsom and Democrats in Sacramento made partisan deals behind closed doors to redraw districts in ways that benefit themselves and their allies, not voters,\" Kim said. \"I'm running because it is clear we need an America First champion to take the fight to the radical Democrats and help President Trump unleash the Golden Age.\"\n\nIt's not yet clear if anyone else, including any Democrats, will enter the race.", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/losangeles/news/republican-showdown-set-for-californias-new-40th-congressional-district-as-calvert-kim-announce-candidacies/"}

The lawsuit claims the map-makers illegally used race as a factor to favor Hispanic voters, and asks the court to block the new boundaries ahead of the 2026 elections.

On Tuesday, the Party recaptured the governorship in Virginia, with the victory of the former congresswoman Abigail Spanberger over the Republican Lieutenant Governor Winsome Earle-Sears, and held the governorship in New Jersey, with the congresswoman Mikie Sherrill's defeat of Jack Ciattarelli. Both victories had been expected, as was Zohran Mamdani's defeat of Andrew Cuomo in the New York mayoral election. (Spanberger and Sherrill won by approximately fifteen and thirteen percentage points, respectively; Mamdani appears on track for a high single-digit win.) Democrats also did well lower down the ballot in a number of Virginia races, in state races in Pennsylvania and Georgia, and notably in California, where the redistricting referendum led by Gavin Newsom -- a response to Texas's Republican-led effort to create five new G.O.P. House seats -- passed overwhelmingly.\n\nTo talk about the election results, and what they portend for next year's House and Senate races, I spoke by phone with Sean Trende, the senior elections analyst at RealClearPolitics and a visiting scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. During our conversation, which has been edited for length and clarity, we discussed why Democrats managed to outperform expectations, the trouble Republicans face without Donald Trump on the ballot, and what the results mean for 2026 and 2028.\n\nWhat's your biggest takeaway from Tuesday's results?\n\nIt's a bad night to be a Republican. It's hard to see what the silver lining is when you have losses all over the place.\n\nIn the past nine months or so, a lot of people have been saying that the Democratic Party's brand is in the toilet. Democrats are not popular. They seem disliked by much of the country, including a big chunk of their own voters. This is not a good place to be if you're a Democrat. How much does this really matter if you are the opposition party? How did you see that question before tonight, and do you see it any differently now?\n\nI have a long-standing belief that elections are referenda on the party in power. My first reaction when I started hearing the argument that Democrats were in trouble was that I had heard the exact same argument in 2010. You may recall that Obama had an entire post-financial crisis spiel about how the Republicans had driven the car into the ditch and now the Democrats were trying to help it out. It went on for quite some time, but voters didn't care. They didn't like Republicans, but they didn't like what Democrats were doing, either. [Republicans had huge success in the 2010 midterms.] And I think it's the same story today, with the parties flipped. People's dislike of some things that Democrats believe and do might be a problem for governing when Democrats win, but I don't think it's a problem for elections.\n\nTrump is not that popular, but he does bring certain benefits to Republicans when he is on the ballot, especially in terms of turnout. In most elections during the Trump era when he has not been on the ballot, Democrats have done well. Broadly speaking, Republicans seem to do quite poorly when he is not on the ballot.\n\nYeah, we saw a similar thing with Obama. He was a political force and could turn out all kinds of voters in Presidential elections, but the Democrats would get walloped in the off-year elections. And I think Trump has a similar effect. There are a lot of true Trump voters out there who just aren't going to show up in the off-year elections. And, meanwhile, Republicans have kind of traded away their big advantage, which was upper-class suburbanites who vote during the off years. Now those people are mostly Democrats.\n\nWhen I grew up and was following politics, people often talked about the desire of voters to keep a check on the party in power. So, if you had Republicans in power, you would want to vote for Democrats, and the President's party would often lose midterm elections. That still seems true, but now the story seems to be about there being different electorates in off-year elections. Has there been a change of some sort?\n\nI think that, as we've become more polarized and there are fewer swing voters, it's become more about who is voting. It's less of a persuasion game and more of just a simple turnout game. That's the beginning and end of it. We are in a highly polarized environment where there just aren't that many marginal voters, and you don't really see the types of swings that you would have seen from, say, 1964 to 1980. It's just harder and harder to persuade people. It's about getting your voters to the polls, and that's not a good bargain for Republicans right now.\n\nThe theory of politics you have just described -- that it's more about motivating people than persuasion -- is normally viewed more sympathetically by more ideological party members, and less so by centrists. Democrats have been engaging in this debate about whether they need to fire up their own voters or reach out to voters in the center. As someone who's followed your work closely, I would not think of you as someone who has the perspective that parties just need to fire up their own voters. Have you changed your opinion?\n\nGenerally speaking, Americans still don't like radical change. They don't like tariffs being sprung on them willy-nilly. They don't like some of the things that Democrats in power do. So where moderation, I think, can help is when you're actually governing. That distinction is what we were talking about a little bit at the beginning -- about how it doesn't matter that you're unpopular when you're out of power, but, when it comes to governing and we start talking about the, like, seven or eight per cent that's persuadable, it could be a problem.\n\nOn Tuesday, two gubernatorial candidates, in Virginia and New Jersey, who are considered more moderate did quite well, and outperformed the polls. In Virginia, they did better than Democrats had done in 2017, during Trump's first term. And in New Jersey they maybe did a little bit worse, but, at the same time, New Jersey has come much closer to being a purple state in the past decade, or at least it was in the last election. So, do people who are making the case that moderation is crucial for Democrats to win have an argument about these two races?\n\nYeah, and I think you summed up the argument there. If you're looking for a counter on that, it would be the Virginia attorney general's race, right? That's where you had, I think, a pretty radical sounding Democratic candidate. Maybe people rationalized it away, but he ended up running only four points behind Spanberger. And over all, he will win by about six points, and Spanberger will have won by about fifteen. So I think that actually gives you a pretty good insight into what the universe of persuadable voters was. Twenty years ago in Virginia, a guy who got caught texting the things that the soon-to-be attorney general did would have run much worse. [Jay Jones, the Democrat, fantasized in text messages about shooting a Republican colleague.] So that's the polarization and the limit on how much radicalism can hurt you in a general election right there.", "url": "https://www.newyorker.com/news/q-and-a/what-the-democrats-good-night-means-for-2026-and-beyond"}

In fact, it was -- or, at least, it had been at first. A month before Newsom's pronouncement, as Politico has since reported, a senior House Democrat asked Paul Mitchell, the top redistricting consultant in California, whether a tit-for-tat would be feasible. Mitchell was skeptical, not least because the state had transferred responsibility for its congressional maps to an independent commission that was popular with voters. Nonetheless, Mitchell was dispatched to tour Texas media and \"blabber about how easy it's going to be for California to redraw our districts,\" he told me. \"We were trying to bluff the state that thinks they invented bluffing.\"\n\nOver time, things got more serious. Texas rammed through its maps, even as Democrats in the state legislature absconded in an attention-grabbing, yet ultimately unsuccessful, attempt to deny quorum. Meanwhile, in California, Mitchell dug into the data and discovered not only that it would be possible to retaliate by drawing five friendlier districts for Democrats but that voters just might approve of the plan. And so Newsom and his allies teed up a ballot measure -- known as Proposition 50, or the Election Rigging Response Act -- that would ask Californians to sanction a temporary revision of the state's congressional lines, with the proviso that the independent commission would kick back in after 2030. Opponents of the proposition got a boost when the former governor Arnold Schwarzenegger -- the godfather, to mix movie metaphors, of the independent commission -- warned that \"two bad behaviors don't make a right behavior.\" But the \"No\" campaign ended up outgunned. Good-government groups that typically oppose partisan redistricting stayed on the sideline; former President Barack Obama got off of it to support Prop 50, despite his own past advocacy for nonpartisan mapmaking. On Tuesday, the polls closed, and the measure's victory was called almost immediately. \"We stood firm in response to Donald Trump's recklessness,\" Newsom said. \"After poking the bear, this bear roared.\"\n\nAs Texas and California made their moves, the redistricting war spread across the nation. Initially, it looked as though Republicans, who currently enjoy a razor-thin 219-213 majority in the House -- not counting an Arizona Democrat who has yet to be seated, after winning a special election in September -- would have more opportunities to create favorable seats. Democrats, in the states they control, appeared hamstrung by a combination of institutional constraints, a lack of political will to circumvent them, and maps that were already disproportionately blue, making it hard to squeeze out further advantage. Last week, for instance, the leader of the Maryland Senate rejected a push to redraw the state's sole Republican seat, citing both legal difficulties and philosophical opposition. (This week, Maryland's governor, Wes Moore, pressed ahead, but it's not yet clear how he'll overcome the Senate-shaped obstacle.)", "url": "https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-lede/california-strikes-back-in-the-redistricting-war"}

Gavin Newsom the green light to redraw the state's congressional maps. The response from GOP leaders is a hypocritical mess.\n\nAfter Texas Republicans redrew their state's congressional district map to give Republicans five additional U.S. House seats, Democrats in California decided they had little choice but to respond in kind. They could not, however, simply approve a gerrymandered map of their own, because state law prohibits such tactics.\n\nTo succeed, Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom and his allies would need voters' permission to create an exception to state law. The result was Proposition 50, and as my MSNBC colleague Allison Detzel explained, it was a triumph for its proponents.\n\nThe results were lopsided: Based on the latest vote tally, roughly 64% of Californians voted in support of the ballot measure, while only 36% opposed it.\n\nDemocrats already control 43 of the Golden State's 52 seats. Once the new map is approved, that total will be on track to reach 48 of the 52 seats.\n\nSeveral hours before the polls closed in California, Donald Trump wrote online that the redistricting effort was \"unconstitutional\" (a word he routinely applies to stuff he doesn't like), before adding that the voting process was \"RIGGED.\" The president concluded that the process \"is under very serious legal and criminal review,\" which sounds very much like a hollow threat.\n\nSoon after, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt insisted that there was \"fraud\" in the election, and when pressed for evidence, the president's chief spokesperson added that her baseless claim is \"just a fact\" -- because she said so.\n\nThe morning after Prop 50's landslide win, House Speaker Mike Johnson went further, calling the voters' verdict a \"tragedy,\" before condemning Newsom's \"immoral leadership\" and California Democrats' willingness to \"rig the system to win.\"\n\nSo when Republicans engage in mid-decade redistricting abuses in Texas, Missouri and North Carolina and take steps to ensure GOP victories long before voters have the chance to cast ballots, that's fine. When Democrats respond in kind, that's \"unconstitutional,\" \"fraudulent,\" \"tragic\" and evidence of a party indifferent to propriety.\n\nIt's helpful when Republican leaders clarify their position on matters like these for the public.", "url": "https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/republicans-proposition-50-california-rcna242127"}

This is the first and most important lesson Republicans should take from the results.\n\nIn elections in New York City, New Jersey, Virginia, Pennsylvania, Georgia and California, there was a huge wave in favor of the Democrats. Governor Gavin Newsom's referendum victory in California will certainly shape the 2026 midterms. Yet, there were some local Republican victories, such as the one for Nassau County executive in New York, which provided the GOP hints of a better future - if Republicans are willing to study and learn from them.\n\nPresident Donald J. Trump suggested that his name not being on the ballot was a major factor in the outcome. This may be true, but it does not solve anything for Republicans. His name is not going to be on the ballot in 2026 or 2028 either. If Republicans do not learn how to connect with, motivate and turn out more Americans, we are in for a huge Democratic comeback in the next election.\n\nPart of the 2025 results are congruent with a principle I learned with President Ronald Reagan in 1980 and 1984 - and the Contract with America campaign in 1994. Wave elections carry everything with them. The deeply flawed and vulnerable Democratic nominee for attorney general in Virginia won - despite having written about killing the Republican Virginia Speaker of the House and hoping his children would die. The larger Democratic wave carried him past his own despicable behavior.\n\nTRUMP'S SHADOW LOOMS LARGE OVER HEATED RACES ONE MONTH BEFORE ELECTION DAY\n\nRepublicans would like New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani to be the future of the Democratic Party. But the outcome of the 2025 election suggests that Governors-elect Abigail Spanberger in Virginia and Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey are much more likely to lead the party. The centrists are returning. This may encourage Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro to consider running in 2028.\n\nWhen you look closely, Spanberger and Sherrill have a surprising amount in common. Both have national security backgrounds (one as a CIA agent, the other as an Annapolis graduate serving in the Navy). Both are mothers (Spanberger has three children, Sherrill has four). Both campaigned as moderates and, when necessary, simply lied about the radical components of their records.\n\nIn a real sense, the Spanberger-Sherrill victories represent the re-emergence of the Obama formula. Former President Barack Obama perfected campaigning as a commonsense moderate while governing as a liberal, sometimes radical, policymaker. It made perfect sense that Obama did not endorse Mamdani. It would have weakened Obama's image as a likable centrist.\n\nWHAT THE RESULTS OF THE 2025 ELECTIONS MAY MEAN FOR DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS\n\nThere was another characteristic of the Democrats' victories which Republicans historically find hard to learn: the power of message discipline. In New York, New Jersey and Virginia, the mantra of the Democrats was affordability and the economy (the top issues concerning Americans). Republicans tried to raise social issues, such as men in girls' sports.\n\nFocusing in on this point, Republicans should make the economy their mission.\n\nThe fact is, the economy is theirs to lose. The One Big Beautiful Bill created enormous incentives for investing in America. Trump's tariffs will ultimately tilt the scales toward American manufacturing over foreign manufacturing. And he has been personally involved in selling products and signing up capital investment.\n\nEVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT ELECTION DAY 2025: CRITICAL ELECTIONS, BALLOT MEASURES AND MORE\n\nIf all this works, there should be a Trump Boom by July 2026. If that happens, the Republicans will own the economy issue, and the Republican Congress will be safe. However, if the economy is anemic or seen as underperforming in 2026, the Democrats will almost certainly win the House by a significant margin.\n\nIf Republicans study and take to heart Tuesday's lessons, the long-term drift toward the GOP will continue. But if Republicans refuse to listen to all the American people (and not only their supporters) - and only focus on what the Democratic winners did wrong (and not what they did right) - the Trump majority could be much shorter and less effective.\n\nIn 1980, President Ronald Reagan won a landslide election. Two years later, Republicans lost 26 House seats and seven governorships. A bad economy and some real communications mistakes (including scaring senior citizens about Social Security) led to a dramatic setback for Reagan. By 1983, former Vice President Walter Mondale was running ahead of Reagan in some polls. However, the Reagan team methodically thought through where the American people were - and what they wanted done. By 1984, Reagan recovered and won 49 states.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\n\nIn 1990, there was a weak economy. The Republican Party had been demoralized by President George H.W. Bush breaking his \"Read my lips: no new taxes\" pledge. The result was a disappointing off-year election. Republicans lost a Senate seat, and four GOP incumbent governors were defeated. Dissatisfaction with both parties led to two independent governors being elected. The House pickup would have been bigger since the Democrats had a 7.8% popular vote advantage, but the Democrats had a 267 to 167 majority, so it was hard for them to pick up a lot more seats.\n\nFocusing in on this point, Republicans should make the economy their mission. The fact is, the economy is theirs to lose.\n\nThe difference between 1982 and 1990 was that the Reagan team understood they had to change course to win in 1984. The Bush team simply could not bring themselves to confront how unhappy their base was - and how big the scale of change would have to be to win re-election. As a result, Ross Perot ran as a third-party candidate and helped end the 12-year Republican presidential ascendency.\n\nCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe big question for President Trump and the Republicans is: Will they listen to the American people and learn what went wrong like Reagan?

But many may have felt Republicans left them with no alternative.\n\nThe AP Voter Poll, an expansive survey of more than 4,000 voters in California, captured the mixed emotions of an electorate that chose to adopt President Donald Trump's own strategy of rewriting the rules by redistricting outside of Census years. Most voters in favor of the proposition hoped to counter his efforts to preserve Republican control of the House in next year's midterm elections - even if they thought redistricting should ideally happen another way.\n\nThe ballot measure's success, as well as voters' apparent hesitations, demonstrates how many people appear to see the current redistricting fight as a political necessity, even if they don't agree with it in principle. The findings suggest that voters see this as a tense and high stakes moment for the country, where compromises may be required.\n\nAbout 9 in 10 California voters said that, generally speaking, each state's congressional district lines should be drawn by a non-partisan commission. But a majority nevertheless backed Proposition 50 to replace the existing districts with new maps crafted to send more California Democrats to the House of Representatives.\n\nRoughly 7 in 10 California voters said party control of Congress was \"very important\" to them, and those voters overwhelmingly supported the amendment to the state's constitution backed by Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat who has emerged as one of Trump's leading antagonists.\n\nNewsom said ahead of the vote that democracy itself was at risk.\n\n\"Prop 50 is not about drawing lines on a map,\" Newsom told a crowd. \"It is about holding the line to what makes us who we are.\"\n\nThe ballot measure was a response to Trump's efforts earlier this year to tilt more congressional districts toward the GOP. Voter discontent with the status quo was apparent. About half of California voters said they are angry about the country's direction, and a similar share pointed to the economy as the most important issue facing the state. Many voters have been left frustrated as Trump's pledge to vanquish inflation has gone unfulfilled, while his import taxes have created a sense of confusion and chaos among businesses and the public.\n\nThe president has successfully pushed Texas, North Carolina, Ohio and Missouri to craft new congressional districts, with Trump placing pressure on additional states in an attempt to swing midterm races that have traditionally favored the party out of the White House.\n\n\"The Unconstitutional Redistricting Vote in California is a GIANT SCAM in that the entire process, in particular the Voting itself, is RIGGED,\" Trump wrote.\n\nTwo-thirds of California voters said they were opposed to states redrawing their congressional district lines in response to how other states have drawn their lines. But the vast majority of the voters who supported the ballot measure said it was necessary to counter the changes made by Republicans in other states.\n\nCalifornia now has the chance to do that by recrafting its 52 House seats in ways that could add five Democrats to Congress in next year's elections. Democrats and voters who lean toward the Democrats - who make up a majority of voters in the state - overwhelmingly voted in support of the ballot measure.\n\nMany acknowledged the process so far has been unjust. About half of California voters said neither the Republicans nor the Democrats are handling the redrawing of congressional district lines fairly.\n\nBut knowing the choices made by other state legislatures, enough California voters decided they had the right reason - even if it felt like the wrong thing.\n\n--\n\nThe 2025 AP Voter Poll, conducted by SSRS from Oct. 22 - Nov. 4, includes representative samples of registered voters in California (4,490), New Jersey (4,244), New York City (4,304) and Virginia (4,215). The AP Voter Poll combines data collected from validated registered voters online and by telephone, with data collected in-person from election day voters at approximately 30 precincts per state or city, excluding California. Respondents can complete the poll in English or Spanish. The overall margin of sampling error for voters, accounting for design effect, is plus or minus 2.0 percentage points in California, 2.1 percentage points in New Jersey, 2.2 percentage points in New York City, and 2.1 percentage points in Virginia.", "url": "https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2025/nov/5/california-voters-approved-redistricting-ballot-measure-according-ap/"}

Gavin Newsom threatened to sue the Trump administration if it sends National Guard troops to San Francisco. (via Gavin Newsom/X)\n\nCiting frustrations with persistent crime, a trio of North Carolina lawmakers is urging Democratic Gov. Josh Stein to deploy the National Guard in Charlotte, saying the state of the city has become \"increasingly dire.\"\n\n\"Recently, the city faced eight homicides in seven days. The murder rate in uptown Charlotte is now 200% higher than it was a year ago,\" the letter states. \"According to the Fraternal Order of Police, aggravated assaults involving knives or guns have risen from 86 in 2024 to 111 in 2025, and personal strong-arm robberies have increased from 26 to 31 in the same period.\"\n\nRep. Mark Harris, R-N.C., one of the letter's authors, said the request doesn't just come from the state's congressional delegation.\n\n\"This is not just my idea. This is the Fraternal Order of Police that had come, saying that they believed this is important and asking the governor and mayor to step up and do it,\" Harris said, alluding to a similar letter published by Charlotte-Mecklenburg law enforcement earlier this year.\n\nMAJOR CITY POLICE UNIONS SUPPORT FEDERAL TROOP DEPLOYMENTS, BUT LOCAL LEADERS ARE PUSHING BACK\n\nThe letter's three signatories, Harris, Rep. Pat Harrigan and Rep. Chuck Edwards, all represent the Charlotte area.\n\nThe North Carolina letter comes as President Donald Trump has used the National Guard to bring attention to crime in cities like Washington, D.C., Memphis, Chicago and others. So far, the administration has deployed the National Guard to six urban areas and floated deployments in another five -- even as courts weigh the use of federal troops to address domestic crime.\n\nThe letter from the North Carolina lawmakers pointed to those deployments as a template for success.\n\n\"Other cities have deployed the National Guard and seen positive results. In Washington, D.C., when President Trump deployed troops under his lawful authority, the city promptly saw a reduction in crime, including twelve consecutive days without a single homicide,\" the letter states.\n\nThat's also the thinking of members of the House Republican Conference leadership. Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., called it a continuation of the administration's work. Scalise serves the conference as majority leader -- the No. 2 Republican in the chamber.\n\n\"Millions of Americans don't feel safe in many once-great cities, and President Trump is working with House Republicans to change that. As we've seen in D.C. and Memphis, President Trump took decisive action, cleaned up our streets, and made those cities safer,\" Scalise said.\n\n\"I commend my colleagues from North Carolina for calling out the violent crime in Charlotte and working to make the city safer for residents and visitors, and encourage more leaders to do the same,\" he added.\n\nMEMPHIS RESIDENTS SPLIT OVER NATIONAL GUARD DEPLOYMENT TO FIGHT CITY'S CRIME\n\nAccording to the Charlotte Police Department's quarterly statistics report, violent crimes, commercial burglaries and larcenies from automobiles have all gone up in Charlotte since last year. But other crimes like homicides, rapes, property crimes and arson have come down modestly from levels in 2024. In many categories, Charlotte's current crime levels are meaningfully lower than rates in 2022 and 2023, with some exceptions.\n\nHarris thinks they could go lower.\n\nHe doesn't envision the National Guard deployment as a long-term solution to fighting crime. Instead, Harris believes the increased law enforcement presence could create an opening for the local police force to find their footing.\n\n\"What I hope comes out of it is that in that time, the police are able to go after whoever these bad guys are, that are threatening this environment of crime. And then, at the end of the day, it's going to create a hope, an outcry from the public that says, 'We're not going to accept our crime-ridden city anymore.'\"\n\nWhen asked what needs to change to make Charlotte's safety a constant, with or without the National Guard, Harris said the city needs to prioritize its policies and resources on keeping violent offenders off the streets.\n\n\"After the murder of Iryna Zarutska, it brought to light a real issue with not keeping criminals behind bars,\" Harris said, referring to the 23-year-old Ukrainian refugee who was stabbed to death on a Charlotte train.\n\nCHARLOTTE CITY COUNCIL MEMBER CALLS OUT 'PAPER-THIN' CRIME STATISTICS AFTER UKRAINIAN REFUGEE'S KILLING\n\n\"In her case, the guy had been arrested 14 times, been put out on the street. These are things that have a lot of issues to be addressed. That's a judiciary issue.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAlthough past efforts to deploy the National Guard have been met with protest from Democratic governors in other states, Harris hopes that Stein will work with the Trump administration as needed if it becomes clear a deployment is needed.\n\nStein's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/politics/gop-urges-democrat-governor-deploy-national-guard-charlotte-crime-surges"}

Andrew Cuomo (running as an independent) by nine points, while Republican Curtis Sliwa came in a distant third.\n\nWhy it mattered: Trump repeatedly singled out Mamdani for criticism, threatening to withhold federal funding from the city if he won and urging voters to back Cuomo. Mamdani called himself \"Donald Trump's worst nightmare\" and pledged to fight him on key issues.\n\nWhat he said: \"In this moment of political darkness, New York will be the light. Here, we believe in standing up for those we love, whether you are an immigrant, a member of the trans community, one of the many Black women that Donald Trump has fired from a federal job, a single mom still waiting for the cost of groceries to go down or anyone else with their back against the wall, your struggle is ours too.. We can respond to oligarchy and authoritarianism with the strength it fears, not the appeasement it craves. After all, if anyone can show a nation betrayed by Donald Trump how to defeat him, it is the city that gave rise to him. ... So Donald Trump, since I know you're watching, I have four words for you: Turn the volume up.\"\n\nWho won: Democrat Mikie Sherrill, who also first won a House seat in the 2018 midterms, defeated Republican Jack Ciattarelli by double digits.\n\nWhy it mattered: Ciattarelli, who narrowly lost a governor's race four years ago after keeping his distance from Trump, ran with his full endorsement this time. Sherrill, meantime, tied him to Trump's handling of the economy and the recent SNAP food aid cuts, among other things.\n\nWhat she said: \"As the president is backing away from this ideal, cutting SNAP, ripping away health care, terminating Gateway, we here in New Jersey are bound to fight for a different future for our children,\" she said. \"We see how clearly important liberty is. We know that no one in our great state is safe when our neighbors are targeted, ignoring the law and the Constitution.\"\n\nWhat happened: A ballot measure backed by Gov. Gavin Newsom to adopt a Democratic redistricting plan as a counter to Republican attempts to gerrymander other states passed resoundingly.\n\nWhy it mattered: The measure will allow California to redraw its maps to offset the Texas redistricting passed earlier this year, helping Democrats stay competitive in next year's midterms.\n\nWhat they said: \"What a night for the Democratic Party -- a party that is in its ascendancy, a party that's on its toes, no longer on its heels,\" Newsom said.\n\nWhat happened: A conservative-backed ballot measure to add new restrictions on voting by mail and require photo ID before casting a ballot, among other changes, lost by double digits.\n\nWhy it mattered: The measure was the latest attempt to impose more stringent requirements on voting, echoing many of the changes that Trump has called for since losing in 2020. These restrictions have tended to fare poorly on the ballot, however, as voters like voting.\n\nWhat they said: \"Maine voters know that our elections are safe and secure, and they sent a loud message today that they will fight to protect voting rights,\" David Farmer, campaign manager for the group Save Maine Absentee Voting, said in a statement.\n\nWhat happened: Three Democratic justices on the state Supreme Court won retention votes by double digits after an unusually aggressive Republican campaign to unseat them.\n\nWhy it mattered: Democrats will likely still have a majority on the Pennsylvania Supreme Court during the 2028 presidential election, when they might be called on to resolve election-related lawsuits. Two of the justices won 10-year terms, while the third will serve until she turns 75 in 2027, the state's mandatory retirement age for justices.\n\nWhat they said: \"I'm really honored that the people showed this confidence in me,\" Justice David Wecht told NBC News. \"I intend to serve the people with fidelity.\"\n\nWhat happened: Democratic Mayor Aftab Pureval overwhelmingly defeated Republican Cory Bowman in the race, which is technically for a nonpartisan post.\n\nWhy it mattered: Bowman is Vice President JD Vance's half-brother and said he was inspired to run when he was attending the inauguration.\n\nWhat they said: Pureval said Bowman called to concede even before the race was called and was \"very classy.\" He said he offered him an opportunity to work together, which Bowman said he would accept.", "url": "https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/election-results-virginia-new-jersey-new-york-project-47-rcna242028"}

There is so much to unpack about last night's election results; we dive into all of it below. Clearly Democrats won big all around the nation, perhaps as a repudiation of sorts of the Trump administration. Having said that, the victory by Zohran Mamdani raises new questions about whether his success will spur other Democratic candidates to go farther left and become more populist.\n\nIt also raises enormous questions for New York City -- the capital of capitalism is set to be led by a democratic socialist -- and perhaps for the future of American capitalism more broadly. Amid growing inequality and an affordability crisis, will Americans turn toward socialism, or is this just a politically idiosyncratic moment? Many corporate leaders have warned that businesses and wealthy individuals would leave the city if he won, and we will be watching to see whether that actually happens.\n\nAlso: Gov. Gavin Newsom's political career got a boost last night, and we've got some thoughts on the role of prediction markets.\n\nThe election takeaways\n\nTuesday's election results were awash in blue, as Democrats won major contests across the nation, including in New York City and California.\n\nThe winners -- like Zohran Mamdani, Representative Mikie Sherrill, Abigail Spanberger and Gov. Gavin Newsom -- may reflect different parts of the political spectrum. But their victories also represent pushback to parts of President Trump's agenda.\n\nWhat to know:\n\n* Mamdani handily beat Andrew Cuomo and Curtis Sliwa, the Republican, in New York's mayoral race, overcoming widespread opposition from the city's business elite.\n\n* Newsom's plan to redraw California's congressional district lines in Democrats' favor won significant support.\n\n* Sherrill decisively defeated Jack Ciattarelli, whom Trump endorsed, in the New Jersey governor's race.\n\n* Spanberger beat Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears and will become Virginia's first female governor.\n\nThe results reflect Democratic anger at Trump:\n\n* The California redistricting plan, Proposition 50, was explicitly aimed at efforts by Trump and Republican allies to rejigger state maps in the G.O.P.'s favor.* Mamdani mentioned Trump by name eight times in his victory speech, pledging to stand up for immigrants and unions.\n\n* Sherrill made opposing Trump a centerpiece of her campaign, seizing on the president's announcement that his administration had \"terminated\" construction on a $16 billion tunnel connecting New Jersey and New York meant to help her state's commuters.\n\n* Spanberger's big margins came in large part from Washington suburbs that have been hugely affected by the government shutdown.\n\nThat said, political observers (and Trump himself) noted that Republican turnout was most likely lower in part because the president himself wasn't on the ballot. Trump also suggested that the shutdown, having entered a record 36th day, weighed on voters.\n\nAffordability was a common theme. The higher cost of everyday life -- including rent, electricity and groceries -- was a message shared by Mamdani, Sherrill and Spanberger, Politico notes.\n\nDemocratic Party officials see it as a potentially winning message against Republicans in midterms next year, hoping to link the costs of Trump's trade war and other policies to voters' fears about their pocketbooks.\n\nThe California win may also bolster Newsom's prospects for a presidential run. The governor, who raised more than $100 million in support of Proposition 50 from backers including the billionaires Reed Hastings, Michael Moritz and George Soros, has emerged as a leading standard-bearer for Democrats.\n\nPrediction markets again nailed the results. Bettors on Kalshi and Polymarket on Tuesday wagered heavily on Democratic wins, even as some polls had suggested tight races in New Jersey and Virginia.\n\nLast night's results will probably further bolster the sites' reputations as mostly reliable political predictors.\n\nHERE'S WHAT'S HAPPENING\n\nInvestor jitters hit Big Tech and crypto. Markets in Asia and Europe were down on Wednesday, as were futures in the tech-heavy Nasdaq, amid worries about sky-high valuations for artificial intelligence-related stocks. A sell-off in chip companies including Samsung Electronics, Advantest and TSMC -- all suppliers to Nvidia -- wiped out $500 billion in combined market value, while shares in SoftBank, which has bet heavily on A.I., fell 10 percent. Crypto also plunged, with Bitcoin dropping below $100,000 on Tuesday for the first time since June.\n\nThe Trump administration nears deals with makers of obesity drugs. Federal officials have been negotiating with Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk to sell doses of some of their obesity drugs on TrumpRx.gov for $149 a month, The Wall Street Journal reports, with an announcement set for Thursday if deals are reached. Novo Nordisk on Wednesday lowered its growth outlook for the year, citing price competition. Separately, Novo Nordisk and Pfizer raised their bids for the weight-loss drug developer Metsera.\n\nJPMorgan Chase says it's being investigated over debanking claims. The bank disclosed in a regulatory filing that it was answering inquiries from government officials and others after President Trump ordered banking regulators to review cases in which banks were accused of discriminating against conservative customers. Trump has accused both JPMorgan and Bank of America of refusing his business after his defense of those who attacked the Capitol in 2021.\n\nAn Elon Musk ally is nominated again to run NASA. Trump renamed Jared Isaacman to lead the space agency after pulling his nomination in June after the president had a falling-out with Musk. Isaacman, a billionaire entrepreneur who led two private missions to orbit on rockets from SpaceX, has contributed to Democratic candidates, which reportedly also upset Trump.\n\nBusiness leaders respond to Mamdani's win\n\nWall Street spent millions in a failed effort to derail Zohran Mamdani's rise to power.\n\nNow that the 34-year-old democratic socialist has been elected New York's youngest mayor in more than a century, many of the city's business leaders are bracing for what's next.\n\nThe reaction falls into three camps:\n\nKeep up the fight: Many on Wall Street view Mamdani's progressive politics -- including taxing the rich and big corporations -- as bad for business. Others fear that Mamdani's past criticism of the city's police will negatively affect public safety, making it harder for businesses to recruit and maintain staff in the city.\n\nSome states are watching the potential fallout. The Florida Council of 100, a pro-business group, is set to release a statement on Wednesday, a draft of which was viewed by The Times. The statement targeted to New York executives by promoting the state's \"pro-growth environment and a commitment to opportunity.\"\n\n(Mamdani's criticism of the Israeli government and the prospect of landing on President Trump's enemies list are also chief worries.)\n\nSome are turning their attention to Albany. \"Guys like me are definitely seriously considering\" lobbying state lawmakers to limit the Mamdani agenda, David Modiano, a managing director at Thales Capital, told The Times.\n\nOthers vow to oppose single issues, like Mamdani's plan to open city-run grocery stores. \"Just because he campaigned on it doesn't mean he'll be able to implement it,\" David Schwartz, the director of the New York Association of Grocery Stores, told Reuters.\n\nSound the alarms: Some real estate executives say Mamdani's rent-freeze plan could backfire. \"You're just going to have a lot less attraction of people to build the housing that we need, which Zohran acknowledges that we need so desperately,\" Kenny Burgos, the C.E.O. of the New York Apartment Association, a trade group that represents building owners and managers, told Fox Business.\n\nExtend an olive branch: Several business leaders had warned that a Mamdani win would lead to an exodus of the city's wealthy to lower-tax states, but those predictions have quieted recently. The mood seemed to improve after several prominent New Yorkers, including Jamie Dimon and Mike Bloomberg, spoke with Mamdani in the final weeks of the campaign to discuss the city's most pressing issues.\n\nSince then, Jane Fraser, the C.E.O. of Citigroup, the billionaire crypto investor Mike Novogratz and Ralph Schlosstein, a co-founder of BlackRock, are among those who have thrown tacit support behind Mamdani, according to Bloomberg. \"I do care deeply about the city, and I'm not going anywhere, whoever the mayor is. I'm going to do whatever I can to help be successful,\" Schlosstein said.\n\nEven Bill Ackman, a fierce Mamdani critic who helped bankroll Andrew Cuomo's failed mayoral bid, seems to be throwing in the towel. \"Congrats on the win,\" he wrote on X. \"Now you have a big responsibility. If I can help NYC, just let me know what I can do.\"\n\n\"Today's first-time buyers are building less housing wealth and will likely have fewer moves over a lifetime as a result.\"\n\n-- Jessica Lautz, an economist for the National Association of Realtors, on a potentially momentous new development: The median age of first-time American house buyers has hit 40, as younger people are increasingly priced out of the market. The trade group has called on lawmakers to adopt policies to bolster housing supply and bring costs down.\n\nMamdani's other tax gambit\n\nZohran Mamdani won on a promise to combat New York's rising cost of living by providing more affordable housing, fast and free buses and universal child care. Funding that agenda rests on taxing the wealthiest New Yorkers and the largest corporations.\n\nA lot of attention has gone to Mamdani's plan to raise taxes 2 percent on New Yorkers making more than $1 million a year. Niko Gallogly has the run down on the other half of his plan: raising New York's corporate tax rate to 11.5 percent.\n\nFirst, some context:\n\n* New York's 7.25 percent corporate tax rate is already the 17th highest in the nation. Some corporate taxes in the state are higher than in all neighboring states and other major states like California and Illinois. Business havens like Nevada and Texas have a 0 percent rate.\n\n* Mamdani's proposed rate hike would tie New York with New Jersey for the highest corporate tax rate in the country.\n\n* Mamdani has argued that President Trump's 2017 tax cuts slashed federal corporate taxes to 21 percent from 35 percent, which would theoretically allow corporations to pay more in state taxes. His campaign estimates the move would generate about $5 billion in annual revenue\n\nExecutives say Mamdani's plan would make New York less competitive. Julie Samuels, the president and C.E.O. of the industry group Tech:NYC, told DealBook that the possibility of higher corporate taxes was raising \"a lot of concern across business leaders.\"\n\nWhile companies are unlikely to flee en masse if the proposal becomes policy, the departure of some New York firms during the pandemic, including the investment firm Elliott Investment Management, underline the possibility that some may go. Businesses could also respond by growing head count outside Manhattan, where they can pay lower wages and taxes.\n\nUltimately, a corporate tax hike isn't up to Mamdani. The plan requires approval from the State Legislature and Gov. Kathy Hochul, who has said she does not intend to increase taxes, but is up for re-election and faces a primary challenge from the left. For business leaders, \"all eyes will be on Albany,\" Samuels said.\n\nTHE SPEED READ\n\nDeals\n\n* Yum!

Here's what to know about the ballot proposals.\n\nIn this article\n\nCalifornia: Proposition 50 on redistricting\n\nReturn to menu\n\nCalifornia is projected to pass Proposition 50, a new voting map championed by Gov. Gavin Newsom (D), according to the Associated Press.\n\nThe redistricting proposal temporarily overrides California's independent redistricting commission and allows the state to draw new congressional maps that could help Democrats win as many as five new seats. It could also counterbalance President Donald Trump's efforts to redraw district maps in Texas and other Republican-led states.\n\nColorado: Funding for school meals\n\nReturn to menu\n\nVoters in Colorado are projected to vote in favor of Prop MM, according to the AP. The ballot measure seeks to increase state income taxes on individuals earning at least $300,000 annually to help fund nutrition assistance programs.\n\nThe generated revenue would primarily be used to provide free breakfast and lunch to students in participating public schools as part of the state's Healthy School Meals for All program, while any additional funds would go toward the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).\n\nMaine: Photo ID for voting and 'red flag' gun law\n\nReturn to menu\n\nVoters in Maine considered two measures: one on voting ID requirements and another on gun restrictions.\n\nThe AP projected that Maine voted to block Question 1, a proposal that would have added a photo ID requirement for voting and tightened rules on absentee voting.\n\nQuestion 2 is set to pass, however, according to the AP. The \"red flag\" law would allow relatives and law enforcement officials to petition courts to temporarily restrict access to guns and other dangerous weapons for individuals who pose a significant danger to themselves or others. Gov. Janet Mills (D) had opposed the measure, arguing that it would place the burden of seeking a court order on families rather than law enforcement.\n\nNew York City: Proposal to reschedule local elections\n\nReturn to menu\n\nThe AP projected that New York City residents voted to block ballot measure 6, which sought to move local elections from odd-numbered to even-numbered years and bring them into alignment with presidential elections. Proponents argued that the change would have increased voter turnout, but the vote was also nonbinding -- it would require an amendment to the state constitution too.\n\nTexas: Amendments on parental rights and citizenship voting\n\nReturn to menu\n\nTwo key amendments to Texas's state constitution are among the proposals on the ballot projected to pass there, according to the AP.\n\nProposition 15 seeks to enshrine parental rights in the state's constitution, by affirming a parent's right \"to exercise care, custody, and control\" of their child, including making decisions about their upbringing. The issue has arisen as part of debates over parental rights and religious freedom. Critics argued that it was overly vague and could restrict young people's independence.\n\nProposition 16 affirms existing legislation that already requires proof of citizenship to vote in state and local elections, by inserting language banning noncitizens from voting into the state constitution. According to the AP, it is also set to pass. Trump and some Republican lawmakers have sought to prevent noncitizen voting across the nation, even though such cases have historically been rare.", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/11/05/new-york-california-texas-colorado-ballot-measure/"}

Passage of California's Proposition 50, the redistricting issue on the state ballot, is poised to provide Democrats with five additional U.S. House seats next year -- helpful in their fight to win back control of Congress -- and to provide a major boost to the presidential prospects of Gov. Gavin Newsom.\n\nThrough his frequent news media appearances and combative social media presence, Newsom has emerged over the past several months as the closest thing the national Democratic Party has to a Trump-slayer, at least right now. But spearheading the fight to counter the presidential-led mid-decade redistricting efforts provided Newsom with a platform that could further enhance his presence as a leader in the 2028 primary field.\n\nAt core, the ballot proposition asked Californians to turn their backs, at least temporarily, on efforts they'd already made to be responsible about redistricting. More than a decade ago, California voters rejected the inherent conflict of interest that allows elected officials of both parties to collude in drawing legislative and congressional boundaries that protect their incumbents from the annoyance of competitive reelection campaigns. In 2008 and 2010, they passed a pair of ballot initiatives that took this power away from the state legislature and granted it to a bipartisan citizens commission.\n\nBut that was a different political era and a much different political landscape. When President Donald Trump encouraged Texas Republicans to redraw their state's congressional districts this summer to protect the GOP's House majority, it created a domino effect: So far, more than a dozen other states have announced plans or taken steps to redraw their own maps. This gradual decline into craven partisanship already affects one-third of the states with more than one congressional district. Ohio became the latest on Friday.\n\nThanks to the two ballot initiatives that Californians passed in a more innocent era, the challenge before Newsom and his allies was to persuade a statewide electorate to reverse their own well-intentioned redistricting reforms. The governor understands his state well enough to know that Californians would be reluctant to undo their own democracy-enhancing handiwork, so he made two savvy political calculations to enhance the prospects for Proposition 50.\n\nThe first was to draft his measure as a temporary suspension that would allow the citizens commission to be back in charge of the regularly scheduled 2030 redistricting -- a point when the specter of Trump presumably will no longer loom. Newsom's second stratagem was to recast a debate over the arcane topic of congressional line-drawing into a fight that deep-blue California would lead against a president the vast majority of the state's voters had opposed in three consecutive presidential elections.\n\nWhile Prop 50 enjoys a sizable lead in the final round of preelection polling, things weren't always so certain. When the redistricting skirmishes began in August, an Emerson College statewide poll showed that one-third of California voters supported the effort, a quarter opposed it and 42% were undecided. But support for the measure grew rapidly after Newsom's immense fundraising efforts created a one-sided debate on Golden State airwaves and screens.\n\nThe anti-Trump clarion significantly heightened Newsom's national profile and allowed him to dramatically enlarge his financial support from out-of-state small donors. Both stand to be of immense benefit in the next presidential election, but in the immediate term, they provided an overwhelming fundraising advantage for the Proposition 50 campaign. In what may be a political first, Newsom actually asked his donors to stop giving money to the campaign, since there was nothing left on which to spend.\n\nNational Republicans had vowed to match the $100 million-plus that Newsom and his allies had pledged to raise, but after the campaign began, they apparently decided that they would rather direct that money to competitive House races around the country next year than risk it on an all-or-nothing initiative fight in a strongly hostile Golden State. They ultimately came through with only a tiny portion of that sum. That left California megadonor and activist Charles Munger Jr. and former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger -- who led the drive for the original reforms and are Prop 50's most high-profile opponents today -- to fight a lonely battle without the national support they had been promised.\n\nTuesday's result is poised to leave the GOP with as few as four U.S. House seats in a 52-member state delegation. California's Republican Party has been a nonfactor for many years, although its legislative leaders have recently achieved some gains by teaming with centrist Democrats on public safety and energy policy. Most state conservatives focus their attention on either national politics or local and legislative campaigns in their remaining bastions of influence. With the passage of Prop 50, their minuscule role in state politics will diminish even further.\n\nNewsom, on the other hand, is just getting started. A Prop 50 victory is not nearly enough to guarantee him the Democratic presidential nomination, but it should give him a seat at the primary table if he so desires -- which he certainly appears to.", "url": "https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/california-prop-50-redistricting-gavin-newsom-rcna241469"}
{"source_domain": "washingtonpost.com", "published": "2025-11-05T11:10:11Z", "title": "Analysis | 'It's affordability, stupid'", "description": "In today's edition ... A massive night for Democrats ... It's still the economy, stupid ... California responds to Texas on redistricting ... but first ...\n\nThe big news\n\nHere's what happened in last ...", "content": "In today's edition ... A massive night for Democrats ... It's still the economy, stupid ... California responds to Texas on redistricting ... but first ...\n\nThe big news\n\nHere's what happened in last night's elections.\n\nThe big takeaway: Voters delivered significant wins to Democrats nationwide last night, putting Republicans on the defensive a year after the nation elected President Donald Trump.\n\nVirginia: Democrats swept. Abigail Spanberger won the governorship, Ghazala Hashmi the lieutenant governorship and Jay Jones the attorney general's office. Democrats also flipped over a dozen seats in the House of Delegates, expanding their majority to at least 61 seats in the 100-seat body with more races still to be called. It was one of the most successful nights for Democrats in the commonwealth's history.\n\nNew Jersey: Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill won the governorship, beating former state assemblyman Jack Ciattarelli. Sherrill's running mate, Dale Caldwell, will be lieutenant governor; New Jersey's governor appoints the attorney general.\n\nNew York: Democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani won the mayor race, beating former Democratic governor Andrew M. Cuomo and Republican Curtis Sliwa.\n\nCalifornia: Proposition 50, which would allow the adoption of a new congressional map that could add five more Democratic House seats, passed.\n\n'It's affordability, stupid'\n\nNew York's mayor-elect, Zohran Mamdani, shares few similarities with Virginia's governor-elect, Abigail Spanberger, and New Jersey's governor-elect, Mikie Sherrill.\n\nYes, they were all Democratic nominees. But Mamdani, a 34-year-old immigrant who on Tuesday won New York City's mayoral contest, is a proud democratic socialist who ran a progressive campaign that championed freezing certain rents, instituting free bus fares and creating a network of city-owned grocery stores. Spanberger, a 46-year-old mother of three and former CIA officer, and Sherrill, a 53-year-old mother of four and former U.S. Navy helicopter pilot, both embraced a more centrist view that focused on countering Trump's second-term actions, curbing inflation and lowering household costs.\n\nAnd yet, there was one through line that connected all three winning campaigns: affordability.\n\n\"You all chose leadership that will focus relentlessly on what matters most: Lowering costs, keeping our communities safe and strengthening our economy for every Virginian,\" Spanberger said at her raucous election-night event.\n\n\"I'm determined to build prosperity for all of our citizens, and I've heard from thousands of you about what liberty and prosperity mean to you, what it's going to take for your family to thrive,\" Sherrill said during her victory speech before vowing to declare a state of emergency to halt increases on energy costs.\n\n\"Central to [our] vision will be the most ambitious agenda to tackle the cost of living crisis that this city has seen since the days of Fiorello La Guardia,\" Mamdani said, describing his victory as \"a mandate for a city we can afford.\"\n\nThe trio approached the issue from different ideological perspectives, but they each centered their campaigns on making life more affordable. That focus, Democrats told us, comes from a lesson learned during the 2024 presidential campaign, when the party struggled mightily to respond to voters' cost-of-living concerns. And the candidates' focus on affordability could provide a road map for a range of Democratic candidates in next year's key races.\n\n\"The top issue across the country is affordability. We saw it last cycle. We see it now. And I think it continues to be a top theme as we head into 2026,\" said Rep. Suzan DelBene, chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. \"Costs are going up and folks want [members of Congress] to focus on lowering costs and helping families. ... So [it's] absolutely a big issue and only becoming a bigger issue.\"\n\nRepublicans have signaled they plan to use Mamdani against Democrats in future elections, arguing that his democratic socialism represents mainstream Democratic ideology. Already working to counter that narrative, DelBene noted that the House map next year will be \"decided in purple districts across the country\" that are notably different from New York. And, she argued, voters \"in places like Iowa, Nebraska or Arizona, are focused on the cost of living, the needs that they have in their communities ... not who the mayor of New York is.\"\n\nThere is some irony here. Trump was successful in talking about the economy in 2024, lambasting Biden's record as Democrats struggled to convince voters that the economy was actually better than they thought. That disconnect is seen as a key reason Trump defeated Vice President Kamala Harris and Republicans won control of the Senate while retaining control of the House.\n\nSince that election, inflation has remained a persistent issue. Everything from utility costs to grocery prices have jumped over the last year and voters aren't just taking note -- they are blaming Trump. A Washington Post-ABC News-Ipsos poll released on Tuesday found that roughly 6 in 10 Americans blame Trump \"a great deal\" or \"a good amount\" for price increases, with 62 percent disapproving of his handling of the economy.\n\nTrump has been in denial about voters' economic concerns. The president regularly says, \"The economy is unbelievable,\" and \"prices are down.\" And when pressed by \"60 Minutes\" recently about rising grocery prices, he said, \"No, you are wrong.\"\n\nThe 2024 \"election has forced Democrats to confront the fact that we lost trust with voters and lost focus for a bit on some core issues, and Republicans hit us over the head with that,\" said Dan Kanninen, the battleground state director for Harris's presidential campaign. \"But now we are all seeing the same thing happen to Republicans. They talked a big game on costs in 2024, but have done absolutely nothing to address costs.\"\n\nReflecting on when James Carville coined \"It's the economy, stupid\" during the 1992 presidential campaign, as a reminder of the importance of cost-of-living issues at that time, Kanninen added: \"It's now more apt to say it's affordability, stupid. ... It's been clarifying for our party to get back to that home base of costs and connecting with voters.\"\n\nThe disconnect between Republicans' successful economic messaging in 2024 and their failed messaging a year later was most apparent in Virginia's gubernatorial race, where Lieutenant Governor Winsome Earle-Sears struggled to discuss economic issues, and instead focused much of her time and money talking about transgender rights and schools.\n\n\"The Sears strategy in this campaign has been totally mystifying to me,\" Bill Bolling, the former Republican lieutenant governor of Virginia, said shortly before Election Day. \"All the polling data says the issues on the top of Virginians' minds are jobs, the economy, and the cost of living.\"\n\nJesse Ferguson, a Democratic operative from Virginia, argued that Earle-Sears -- and Republicans writ large -- fell into the same trap that Democrats did in 2024: Telling voters not to believe what they were actually feeling on the economy.\n\n\"They didn't talk about labels and factions, they talked about prices, paychecks and power bills,\" Ferguson said of Spanberger, Sherrill and Mamdani. \"That's what cut through the noise.\"\n\nIn New York, it often seemed that no matter what question Mamdani was asked, he found a way to pivot to talking about the cost of living in America's largest city.\n\nThis was maybe never clearer than when Mamdani, days before Election Day, was asked about Trump telling \"60 Minutes\" that he was a \"much better looking person than him.\"\n\n\"My focus is on the cost-of-living crisis, man,\" Mamdani said, laughing as he walked away.\n\nWhat we're watching\n\nCalifornia's Proposition 50 should give Democrats five more safe congressional seats, countering the five new red districts created by Texas's legislature earlier this year.\n\nAs we talked about earlier this week, many other states are eyeing redistricting efforts. So far, GOP lawmakers in Missouri and North Carolina have each created one more Republican seat. Indiana's Republican governor, Mike Braun, called a special legislative session to draw more Republican districts. Virginia has also initiated a redistricting push to favor Democrats, which the party can now continue after securing a majority in the House of Delegates last night.\n\nMaryland became the latest blue state to join the trend when Gov. Wes Moore kicked off a redistricting process to get rid of the state's sole Republican district yesterday, despite fierce opposition from some of his fellow Maryland Democrats.\n\nDemocrats are confident no matter how Republicans gerrymander red states, they will still have the advantage in the 2026 midterms.\n\nThe party that doesn't control the White House has historically won the popular vote nationwide in midterm House elections by 4.5 percentage points. The House Majority PAC, the super PAC affiliated with House Democratic leadership, sent out a memo today predicting a double-digit net -- allowing them to take back the House -- even if all GOP gerrymandering efforts succeed, assuming historical trends hold up.\n\nNational Republican Congressional Committee Chair Richard Hudson said his party will work to win whatever new districts are drawn in California.\n\n\"Even under this new map, Republicans have clear opportunities to flip seats because Californians are fed up with Democrat chaos,\" he said in a statement. \"We will continue to compete and win because our candidates are stronger, our message is resonating, and Californians are tired of being ignored.\"\n\nFor a related read, check out Maeve Reston's account of how Gov. Gavin Newsom got Prop 50 across the finish line.\n\nGet ready with The Post\n\nIn memoriam\n\nFormer Vice President Dick Cheney is dead. He was 84.\n\nCheney was perhaps the most powerful vice president in American history, profoundly shaping the country's response to terrorism in the aftermath of 9/11. He ordered the use of \"any means at our disposal\" to eliminate terrorists, and ignored legal prohibitions on torture and domestic surveillance. He was also deeply involved in President George W. Bush's domestic policy, advocating for a strong executive and free market.\n\nThough a pillar of the Republican Party while in office, he became a fierce critic of Trump in retirement. He defended his daughter, former representative Liz Cheney, who was one of two Republicans on the House committee that investigated the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, from GOP vitriol. He endorsed Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election, saying at the time \"there has never been an individual who is a greater threat to our republic than Donald Trump.\"\n\nRead Barton Gellman and Marc Fisher's masterful obituary for the former vice president. And Karen Tumulty reflected on how Cheney lived most of his life as a Republican insider, but died on the outside.\n\nIn your local paper\n\nPortland Press Herald: Maine voters voted down a referendum that would have required photo ID to vote in elections and restricted access to absentee voting.\n\nThe Philadelphia Inquirer: All three justices of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court up for a retention vote won their elections.\n\nMinnesota Star Tribune: Minneapolis went to bed last night not knowing who their next mayor will be, as none of the candidates won a majority of first-choice votes. Second-choice votes will be counted today.\n\nSend a reply\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the election results? Any surprises?

Gavin Newsom of California gave them one.\n\nCalifornia voters on Tuesday overwhelmingly supported Proposition 50, Mr. Newsom's measure to create more Democratic congressional seats, countering a similar redistricting effort pushed by Mr. Trump in other states to protect Republican control of the House next year.\n\nThe result has sharply lifted Mr. Newsom's political profile at a moment when he is considering running for president. And it has provided what many Democrats praised as a road map on how to fight for a party that remains adrift one year after Mr. Trump captured the White House.\n\n\"It shows that he can get stuff done,\" said the chairwoman of the South Carolina Democratic Party, Christale Spain, who hosted Mr. Newsom on a swing through her state in July. She added, \"Democrats want somebody to fight back. He's pushing back and fighting back. That is what is helping him break through.\"\n\nThe election has now freed Mr. Newsom, whose term as governor ends in January 2027, to turn his attention to elevating his presence on the national stage, presenting himself as a leader who scored a high-profile electoral win for Democrats at a bleak moment for the party.\n\nHe is planning to travel the country campaigning on behalf of Democratic congressional candidates. He has a forthcoming memoir to promote. And aides said he is likely to soon pivot to the issue of climate change and cast himself as a climate champion, drawing a contrast with Mr. Trump and his supporters.\n\nThe California results capped an evening of coast-to-coast victories by Democrats, including contests for mayor of New York, governor of Virginia and governor of New Jersey.\n\nThe outcome in California was never preordained. Mr. Newsom took a political risk: He was essentially asking voters to overturn, albeit temporarily, a measure they had passed 15 years ago requiring a nonpartisan commission to draw congressional district lines. He faced opposition from governmental reform groups and Arnold Schwarzenegger, the former governor who had championed that initiative that created the commission. By the end, the opposition had walked off the field and Mr. Newsom's win was so decisive that the race was called as soon as polls closed.\n\nMr. Newsom was in the carriage house of the governor's mansion at that moment, watching returns with about two dozen friends and aides. A big cheer erupted as soon as CNN called the race in his favor, one of his aides said, and then Mr. Newsom headed for the California Democratic Party headquarters, where he addressed news cameras with a somber tone that lacked the typical election night celebrations.\n\nStanding between an American flag and a California flag, Mr. Newsom cast the result as a repudiation of Mr. Trump and a victory for Democrats in California and across the nation.\n\n\"What a night for the Democratic Party -- a party that is in its ascendancy, a party that's on its toes, no longer on its heels,\" the governor said.\n\nThe result marks a decided turn in Mr. Newsom's fortunes. Just 18 months ago, he seemed in danger of being overshadowed by another California Democrat and sometimes-rival, Kamala Harris, the former vice president who had become the Democratic candidate for president after Joseph R. Biden Jr. dropped out of the race.\n\nHe was being disparaged by many leaders on the left for using his podcast to embrace and interview conservative supporters of Mr. Trump, including Charlie Kirk and Steve Bannon. He struck an initially conciliatory stance toward Mr. Trump, again roiling many in his party, going to the airport in Los Angeles to warmly greet the president on the tarmac when he flew there earlier this year to inspect the damage after devastating wildfires.\n\nBut Mr. Newsom began to methodically reposition himself this summer, after Mr. Trump took control of California's National Guard and sent troops into Los Angeles. He began using social media to mimic and mock the president, in the process drawing approval from the left. His championing of Proposition 50 was the highest-profile evidence of his shift.\n\n\"Six months ago, the strategy was to engage with MAGA leaders like Steve Bannon,\" said Eric Jaye, a Democratic consultant in San Francisco who was an adviser to Mr. Newsom when he was mayor of San Francisco. \"With the Proposition 50 victory, Newsom has made himself Donald Trump's chief, and most successful, antagonist, and that is exactly what Democratic primary voters are looking for nationally.\"\n\nThe road ahead is far from easy if he seeks the presidency.\n\nEven his allies say he carries significant political baggage. He's a product of arguably the most liberal state in the country and a promoter of policies that are seen as out-of-touch with many voters. He has a personal style that at least some of his critics argue is slick and off-putting. And the backlash he generated following one incident during the pandemic has never fully subsided. Mr. Newsom attended a birthday dinner for a lobbyist-friend at The French Laundry, one of the most expensive restaurants in the world, and was photographed not wearing a mask, at a moment when he was telling Californians not to gather with their families for Thanksgiving.\n\nThis is a difficult time for California -- struggling with the aftermath of the fires, a housing crisis and what many Republicans denounce as out of control spending -- all of which Mr. Newsom's opponents would seek to have him own in any presidential campaign.\n\nAnd even though voters approved Mr. Newsom's redistricting measure, it could prove for naught if Republicans manage to hold on to the House, dimming the relevance of the victory on Tuesday.\n\n\"While it's a very important win for him politically, this is just the first step,\" said Brian Brokaw, a Democratic strategist who advises Mr. Newsom. \"Doing what he can to make sure that Democrats win those seats and take back the majority in the midterms will be just as important. Without that, Proposition 50 will have been just a blip along the way.\"\n\nAnd Republicans have already made clear that no matter Mr. Newsom's victory with Proposition 50, they would try to diminish his standing in California and nationally, and seek to derail his attempt to stake out a spot on the presidential stage.\n\n\"Gavin Newsom wants to be president, but before chasing his next job, he's got 12 months left to try and clean up the mess he made in California,\" said Steve Hilton, a Republican and former Fox News host who's running for governor. \"Instead of running the state he's been trying to rig our elections.\"\n\nStill, it's hard to recall a time when Mr. Newsom appeared in such a commanding political position. He raised $114 million for the redistricting campaign, including $38 million from supporters responding to text and email appeals, assembling the kind of small donor list that could prove critical in a presidential race. Much of that money came from outside California.\n\nThe result came not only at a pivotal time for Mr. Newsom but for his party, which believes it has a chance to win back Congress from Republicans. The new lines are expected to help Democrats win as many as five House seats now held by Republicans in California.\n\nOn Tuesday night, Mr. Newsom spoke solemnly about a nation struggling through perilous times, in a speech that suggested the themes he will no doubt strike again in the coming months.\n\n\"I hope it's dawning on people, the sobriety of this moment -- what's at stake,\" he said.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/05/us/newsom-california-election.html"}

A redistricting initiative in California that was a response to Trump's push to redraw congressional lines in GOP-controlled states ahead of next year's midterm elections has been of particular interest to the Republican president.\n\nHis Department of Justice sent election monitors to five counties in California, a state Trump has lost three times and whose mail balloting system he has often criticized despite no evidence of any widespread fraud or other voting-related problems. In a post Tuesday on his social media platform, the president called the state's voting process \"RIGGED\" and warned that it was \"under very serious legal and criminal review. STAY TUNED!\"\n\nClaims of election rigging are almost routine for Trump in the run-up to elections and sometimes on the day of voting itself. On Election Day last year, before he was declared the winner, he claimed without providing any details or evidence that there was \"talk about massive cheating in Philadelphia\" and said law enforcement was on the way. He continues to lie about his loss in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom, who has been championing the redistricting initiative, responded to Trump with his own social media post calling the president \"A totally unserious person spreading false information in a desperate attempt to cope with his failures.\" Secretary of State Shirley Weber called it \"another baseless claim.\"\n\n\"The bottom line is California elections have been validated by the courts,\" she said in a statement. \"California voters will not be deceived by someone who consistently makes desperate, unsubstantiated attempts to dissuade Americans from participating in our democracy.\"\n\nIn Virginia as the polls closed, Susan Beals, commissioner of elections, thanked officials for running a \"very smooth election.\" Beals said there was a power outage in Virginia Beach, but the voting machine had battery backup and emergency lights came on so voting continued.\n\nIn New Jersey, law enforcement and election officials acted swiftly as voting began to secure polling places following a series of bomb threats.\n\nLt. Gov. Tahesha Way, who also serves as the state's top election official, said the threats had been emailed to seven counties, including Passaic, a key swing county. It also is the only county outside California where the Department of Justice had sent election monitors, in both cases at the request of the Republican parties in each state.\n\n\"Law enforcement has determined that there are no credible threats at this time,\" Way said. \"We are doing everything in our power to protect voters and poll workers and coordinate closely with state, local and federal partners to ensure a smooth and safe election.\"\n\nLater in the day, authorities arrested a juvenile suspect in connection with some of the bomb threats. The potential charges were not immediately released.\n\nA New Jersey judge granted a one-hour extension for voters to be able to cast ballots at some polling places in Passaic County.\n\nThe threats came as the final day of voting began in New Jersey's closely-watched race for governor and a year after a series of bomb threats disrupted voting during last year's presidential election, mostly in battleground states. Bomb threat hoaxes also circulated in Springfield, Ohio, last year after Donald Trump during the campaign amplified false claims of Haitian immigrants there abducting and eating pets.\n\nThe threats Tuesday involved nearly two dozen polling places in Bergen, Essex, Mercer, Middlesex, Monmouth, Ocean and Passaic counties, New Jersey Attorney General Matthew Platkin said in a statement. Some polling places reopened quickly, he said, while voters at others were directed to nearby locations to cast their ballots.\n\n\"Law enforcement officers have responded at each affected polling place, and they have worked swiftly to secure these polling locations and ensure the safety of every voter,\" Platkin said.\n\nThe FBI's Newark office said it was aware of the reports and was assisting the state and local agencies. \"This Dept. of Justice is committed to free, fair and safe elections,\" U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a social media post related to the bomb threat investigation.\n\nPassaic County received three threats and redirected some affected voters to other locations early Tuesday, county spokesperson Lindsay Reed said in an email. One location, a school building, was cleared and voting resumed.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, nearly 20% of voters in Chester County were left out of the poll books originally provided to polling locations Tuesday, county officials said. That included voters registered as anything other than a Republican or a Democrat, including those registered with the Green or Libertarian parties or independents with no party affiliation. The category includes about 75,000 registered voters out of roughly 385,000 countywide.\n\nA Chester County judge later extended voting by provisional ballot to 10 p.m. at all polling locations.\n\nElection officials in the Democratic-leaning county located about 40 miles (64.4 kilometers) west of Philadelphia became aware of the problem just after polling places opened and had provided supplemental poll books to all 230 polling locations by late afternoon. There will be a formal review.\n\nA majority of Chester County voters backed Democrat Kamala Harris over Trump in last year's presidential election. Voters on Tuesday were weighing in on local offices, as well as on members of Pennsylvania's highest court. Three Democratic justices on the state Supreme Court were running in nonpartisan retention elections, in which voters give a \"yes\" or \"no\" on whether they serve another term.\n\nThird-party and independent voters who came to cast ballots before supplemental poll books arrived were offered a provisional ballot. County review boards consider the status of provisional ballots within seven days of Election Day.\n\n___\n\nSmyth reported from Columbus, Ohio, and Fingerhut from Des Moines, Iowa.

Texas' move and California's response have kicked off a flurry of redistricting efforts around the country, with Republican states appearing to have an edge. Deeply blue California is Democrats' best opportunity to make up seats.\n\nMidterm elections typically punish the party in the White House, and Trump is fighting to maintain his party's slim House majority. Republicans hold 219 seats to Democrats' 213.\n\nTuesday's results mark a political victory for Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, who cast the measure as an essential tool to fight back against Trump and protect American democracy.\n\nSpeaking to reporters in Sacramento, Newsom cast the California vote as part of a broader national rejection of Trump's policies that saw Democratic governors elevated in New Jersey and Virginia. But he warned the more consequential battle would come next year.\n\nIf Democrats win the House majority, they can \"end Donald Trump's presidency as we know it,\" Newsom said. \"It is all on the line, a bright line, in 2026.\"\n\nCalifornia's Proposition 50 asked voters to suspend House maps drawn by an independent commission and replace them with rejiggered districts adopted by the Democratic-controlled Legislature. Those new districts would be in place for the 2026, 2028 and 2030 elections.\n\nThe recast districts aim to dilute Republican voters' power, in one case by uniting rural, conservative-leaning parts of far northern California with Marin County, a famously liberal coastal stronghold across the Golden Gate Bridge from San Francisco.\n\nThe measure was spearheaded by Newsom, who threw the weight of his political operation behind it in a major test of his mettle ahead of a potential 2028 presidential campaign. Former President Barack Obama urged voters to pass it as well.\n\n\"Republicans want to steal enough seats in Congress to rig the next election and wield unchecked power for two more years,\" Obama said in one ad. \"You can stop Republicans in their tracks.\"\n\nCritics said two wrongs don't make a right. They urged Californians to reject the measure, even if they have misgivings about Trump's moves elsewhere.\n\nAmong the most prominent critics was Arnold Schwarzenegger, the movie star and former Republican governor who pushed for the creation of the independent commission, which voters approved in 2008 and 2010. It makes no sense to fight Trump by becoming him, Schwarzenegger said in September, arguing that the proposal would \"take the power away from the people.\"\n\n\"I don't want Newsom to have control,\" said Rebecca Fleshman, a 63-year-old retired medical assistant from Southern California, who voted against the measure. \"I don't want the state to be blue. I want it to be red.\"\n\nAfter an early burst of TV advertising, opponents of the plan struggled to raise cash in a state with some of the nation's most expensive media markets.\n\nThe campaign followed an unusual trajectory. A handful of Republican congressmen who will see their districts dramatically reshaped - and their jobs endangered -- mostly stayed away from the campaign spotlight. With opponents short on cash, Newsom and his supporters dominated TV screens in the critical closing weeks.\n\nTotal spending on broadcast and cable ads topped $100 million, with more than two-thirds of it coming from supporters. Newsom told people to stop donating in the race's final weeks.\n\nThe GOP congressmen -- Reps. Ken Calvert, Darrell Issa, Kevin Kiley, David Valadao and Doug LaMalfa -- will see right-leaning voters reduced and left-leaning voters boosted in their respective districts in a shift that would make it likely a Democratic candidate would prevail in each race.\n\nIssa issued a defiant statement, saying: \"I'm not going anywhere. I'll continue to represent the people of California regardless of their party or where they live.\"\n\nCalvert said Newsom engineered a \"power grab\" while housing costs, gas prices and taxes continue to strain family budgets. \"I am determined to keep fighting for the families I represent,\" he said in an email.\n\nProposition 50 won a swift and decisive victory, as the AP declared a winner when polls closed statewide. Early returns were strongly in favor of the measure, as were preliminary results from the AP Voter Poll, an expansive survey of more than 4,000 voters in California.\n\nRoughly 7 in 10 California voters said party control of Congress was \"very important\" to them, and those voters overwhelmingly supported the measure, according to the AP Voter Poll.\n\nAbout 8 in 10 California voters who supported the ballot measure said it was necessary to counter the changes made by Republicans in other states, while only about 2 in 10 said they supported it because it was the best way to draw maps, AP Voter Poll found.\n\nTrump, who overwhelmingly lost California in his three presidential campaigns, largely stayed out of the fray. A week before the election, he urged voters in a social media post not to vote early or by mail -- messaging that conflicted with that of top Republicans in the state who urged people to get their ballots in as soon as possible.\n\nIn a post Tuesday on his social media platform, the president called the state's voting process \"RIGGED\" and warned that it was \"under very serious legal and criminal review. STAY TUNED!\" Secretary of State Shirley Weber called that \"another baseless claim.\"\n\nCongressional district boundaries are typically redrawn every 10 years to reflect population shifts documented in the census. Mid-decade redistricting is unusual, absent a court order finding fault with the maps in place.\n\nBeyond Texas, Republicans expect to gain one seat each from new maps in Missouri and North Carolina, and potentially two more in Ohio. Five other GOP-led states are also considering new maps: Florida, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana and Nebraska.\n\nOn the Democratic side, Colorado, Illinois, Maryland, New York and Virginia have proposals to redraw maps, but major hurdles remain.\n\nA court has ordered new boundaries be drawn in Utah, where all four House districts are represented by Republicans, but it remains to be seen if the state will approve a map that makes any of them winnable for Democrats.\n\nSiddhartha Deb, 52, has lived in the U.S. since he was 7 years old but he just became a citizen Tuesday. Immediately afterward he registered to vote at San Francisco City Hall and cast his ballot in favor of Newsom's measure.\n\n\"I don't like the way the Republican Party is basically trying to rig elections by gerrymandering,\" Deb said. \"And this is the only way, to fight fire with fire.\"\n\n___\n\nCooper reported from Phoenix and Nguyen from Sacramento, California.

Joe previously covered breaking news for Forbes and local news in Boston.\n\nCalifornia's approval of Proposition 50 sets in motion a redistricting plan that could result in pickups of five seats for Democrats in the Golden State. It's an effort that may ripple beyond California's borders -- here's an early look at some of Prop 50's potential effects, not all of which are related to redistricting:\n\nA win for Democrats\n\nProp 50 victory, among other things, notches a badly needed win for Democrats in the redistricting battle kicked off by President Trump earlier this year.\n\nThe president, seeking to gain up to five seats for Republicans to try to help them hold the House in the 2026 midterm elections, successfully urged Texas to undertake a mid-decade gerrymander. Newsom said he'd only go through with Prop 50 if Texas passed its new congressional map. In announcing the initiative, Newsom said Mr. Trump is \"trying to rig the system,\" adding \"we have got to meet fire with fire.\"\n\nNew lines would be temporary\n\nThe passage of the ballot measure, pending legal action, will result in a map drawn by California Democrats that takes five Republican congressional districts and makes them more favorable to Democrats. But it would only be used for the 2026, 2028 and 2030 elections.\n\nAfter the 2030 U.S. Census, according to Prop 50, the gerrymandered maps would only be used until the nonpartisan California Citizens Redistricting Commission draws new congressional maps.\n\nNewer maps that squeeze majority's opponents across the country\n\nMore and more states have begun trying to squeeze partisan minorities further through redistricting before next year's midterms. A CBS News poll in October found that among voters who plan to support Proposition 50, one reason they're doing so is to oppose the Trump administration -- which they also feel generally treats California worse than other states -- and to oppose national Republicans.\n\nCalifornia's decision to redraw its maps has already begun to exert pressure on more GOP-led states to launch their own redistricting gambits. Besides Texas, lawmakers in Missouri and North Carolina have passed new maps in recent months that shift one district apiece toward Republicans, and Ohio is considering new maps.\n\nRepublicans in Indiana signaled last month that they didn't have the votes to redraw their maps, but after weeks of pressure from Mr. Trump, GOP Gov. Mike Braun called the legislature into a special session to consider redistricting.\n\nAnd in Maryland, Democratic Gov. Wes Moore has just announced the creation of a redistricting commission to consider mid-decade redistricting.\n\n\"We will explore every avenue possible to make sure Maryland has fair and representative maps,\" Moore said in a statement. But Maryland state Senate president Bill Ferguson, also a Democrat, believes mid-cycle redistricting in Maryland \"is the wrong path for our State,\" he said on X. He warned of legal barriers to redistricting that could result in ceding \"one or two congressional seats to Donald Trump.\"\n\n\"There's fighting fire with fire, and then there's unintentionally burning your own house down in the process,\" Ferguson said.\n\nPlatform for Newsom's political future?\n\nDemocratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who has become one of Mr. Trump's highest-profile adversaries, was the architect of California's mid-decade redistricting effort and fought for the Prop 50 initiative. His push for Prop 50 may for a time have been the most public example of resistance by Democrats against Mr. Trump.\n\nNewsom has not ruled out a run for the presidency in 2028, and his success in selling Prop 50 to voters could help launch a campaign, especially if Democrats are able to take the House in 2026. And he indicated to Robert Costa in a late October interview on \"CBS Sunday Morning\" that he'll give serious thought to running after the 2026 midterm elections.\n\nVoters in Tuesday's race were divided on whether Newsom should run for president in 2028, with 45% saying he should and 54% saying he shouldn't, according to exit polling data.\n\nThe results of Prop 50 tracked closely with voters' views on Newsom's future: Some 94% of Californians who support a Newsom presidential run voted yes on Prop 50, while 65% of those who don't want him to run voted no.", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/losangeles/news/california-redistricting-prop-50-newsom-democrats-trump-consequences/"}

Now What?", "description": "Californians struck back at Republican redistricting efforts around the country on Tuesday, passing a new congressional map designed to flip five red districts and give Democrats a better shot at reta...", "content": "Californians struck back at Republican redistricting efforts around the country on Tuesday, passing a new congressional map designed to flip five red districts and give Democrats a better shot at retaking the House of Representatives next year.\n\nNow that the Proposition 50 map will officially take effect for the next three congressional elections -- in 2026, 2028 and 2030 -- a flurry of Democratic challengers are expected to jump into the newly competitive House race. They will join candidates who announced their entry before voters approved the districts.\n\nOver all, the changes could result in Democrats representing nearly all of Northern California in the House, including the conservative far reaches toward the Oregon border. While Republicans will fight to protect their incumbents, they also plan to file lawsuits to challenge Proposition 50 in court.\n\nHere's what to know about California's new congressional maps.\n\nThree Republicans are particularly vulnerable\n\nFar from the liberal bastions of San Francisco and Los Angeles, California's rural northeast had long been reliable Republican territory. No longer, under the Proposition 50 map.\n\nThe current district of Representative Kevin Kiley, a Republican, stretches from the suburbs outside Sacramento to Lake Tahoe in the north and southward along the Nevada border. It now adds neighborhoods in Sacramento County to become a likely flip for Democrats, according to nonpartisan political analyses of the new map.\n\nMr. Kiley has won tough races before, but he could face a host of experienced Democratic challengers. He could square off against Dr. Richard Pan, the former state senator who has already announced a campaign against him. Local strategists said that other Democrats may be considering the same district, including Representative Ami Bera and State Senator Angelique Ashby.\n\nThe seat has become so vulnerable that Mr. Kiley could consider running in a neighboring district if he likes his chances better there. House candidates do not have to live in the district they represent.\n\nRepresentative Doug LaMalfa, a Republican, faces a similar challenge in his Northern California district, which currently hugs the Oregon border and represents a large agricultural region north of Sacramento. The new map divides his current district, with one new district pulling in a heavily Democratic part of Wine Country and the other adding liberal Marin County.\n\nAudrey Denney, an educator and consultant who lost twice before to Mr. LaMalfa, has already announced a third try against him. Some political strategists have speculated that the race could also attract Mike McGuire, the leader of the California State Senate.\n\nIn Riverside County, east of Los Angeles, Representative Ken Calvert is another Republican who has become suddenly vulnerable. In this case, his district has been carved up and folded into several neighboring districts.\n\n\"We don't see a path for them if this map passes,\" said David Wasserman, the senior elections analyst for the nonpartisan Cook Political Report, said of the Republican incumbents in these three districts.\n\n\"The incumbency bonus is nowhere as big as it used to be,\" Mr. Wasserman added.\n\nDemocrats are eyeing two other seats\n\nThe districts of two Republican congressmen were not reconfigured quite as radically. Still, Representative Darrell Issa, who holds a seat in the inland San Diego area, and Representative David Valadao, in the southern part of the Central Valley, will now be in races that analysts consider to be coin flips.\n\nMr. Issa won re-election last year by nearly 20 percentage points, but Proposition 50 added liberal Palm Springs to his district, making it more favorable to Democrats than before. Ammar Campa-Najjar, who has lost twice before to Mr. Issa, and Marni von Wilpert, a San Diego city councilwoman, are Mr. Issa's most prominent challengers. Several others also could shift from focusing on Mr. Calvert to targeting Mr. Issa.\n\nMr. Valadao is no stranger to tough races because his seat has regularly been one of the nation's most competitive. He won re-election by less than 1 percentage point in 2020. Two years before that, he was ousted by a similar margin.\n\nBut under Proposition 50, his Central Valley district will shed some of its more conservative areas, giving Democrats a greater advantage than before. At least two Democrats have already said they will challenge him: Dr. Jasmeet Bains, a state assemblywoman, and Randy Villegas, a local school board trustee.\n\nMr. Valadao, well aware of his district, has taken a more moderate path than his fellow Republican House members. In 2021, he was one of 10 House members to vote to impeach President Trump over the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol.\n\nAndrew Acosta, a California Democratic strategist, suggested that many Democrats in the state had forgotten how rough-and-tumble an ultracompetitive House race can get, especially in more conservative regions. Democratic challengers who embrace moderate political views, he argued, stood the best shot against the incumbents.\n\n\"We've gotten fat and happy here in California,\" he said. \"We think that this is a big blue state, and everyone loves everybody until you're in a competitive race -- and all of the sudden you realize that Gavin Newsom is not as popular in the district.\"\n\nVulnerable Democrats -- plus one Orange County Republican -- can breathe easier\n\nDemocrats also shored up districts held by more than a half-dozen of their vulnerable incumbents, such as Representatives Derek Tran in Southern California and Adam Gray in the Central Valley. Both are first-term congressmen who each won last year by fewer than 1,000 votes.\n\nBy strengthening their grip on once-vulnerable seats, Democrats could free up time and resources to focus on ousting Republican incumbents and winning races in other states. But making some districts more favorable to Democrats came at a cost: Representative Young Kim, a Republican in a competitive Orange County seat, gained Republican regions that will likely put her once-competitive seat out of reach for Democrats.\n\nDan Schnur, a politics professor at the University of Southern California, said the new map -- and the efforts to put competitive Democratic-held areas out of reach -- would erode the power of California Republicans even further.\n\n\"After this redistricting takes place,\" Mr. Schnur said, \"there won't be much red California left.\"\n\nBut competitive districts that seem winnable on paper can prove elusive for either party. Mr. Acosta warned that beating Republican incumbents on their home turf might not be so easy.\n\n\"There is a consistent theme for most of them that they've been battle-tested,\" he said. \"They've been in races where they've won, they've lost, they've come back and won again.\"", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/05/us/politics/california-prop-50-map-redistricting-democrats.html"}

Next will come a fierce, yearlong fight, first in redistricting battles and then the midterm elections, for control of the House of Representatives and the fate of Mr. Trump's agenda during the final two years of his term.\n\nHere are six takeaways from the first major elections of the second Trump era.\n\nDemocrats finally showed some fight.\n\nDemocrats have spent the last year locked out of power in Washington, searching furiously but mostly in vain for ways to stop President Trump from expanding his power.\n\nThey held protests, spoke all night in the Senate and organized \"No Kings\" rallies that drew millions across the country.\n\nOn Tuesday, they finally hit back in a more concrete way.\n\nDemocrats won statewide elections in Virginia, New Jersey, California and Pennsylvania. They flipped seats on Georgia's Public Service Commission. And they were on the verge of winning a near two-thirds majority in the Virginia House of Delegates, an extraordinary sweep of battleground districts in races that serve as a plausible stand-in for how voters view both parties given the anonymous nature of most of the candidates.\n\nIn New York City, Zohran Mamdani was hovering around 50 percent of the vote in the governor's race as he coasted past former Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who won support from Mr. Trump and other Republicans.\n\nWhen Democrats roared to victory in 2017, during Mr. Trump's first term, it foreshadowed a blue wave in the midterms a year later. On Tuesday night, House Democratic officials were crowing that this year's results would help them recruit strong candidates to challenge Republicans next year.\n\nIt was a bad night for Donald Trump.\n\nIn Virginia, Abigail Spanberger won the governor's race by focusing on Mr. Trump's firing of federal workers and the impact of the government shutdown on her state.\n\nIn New Jersey, Representative Mikie Sherrill finished her successful campaign by railing against Mr. Trump's demand that a key Hudson River tunnel be \"terminated.\"\n\nIn New York City, Mr. Trump's Election Eve endorsement of Mr. Cuomo caused Republicans to swing toward the former governor, but failed to thwart Mr. Mamdani.\n\nAnd in California, voters responded to calls to save the nation from Mr. Trump by approving a ballot measure to redraw the state's congressional districts to shift five of them from to Democrats from Republicans.\n\nThe president was not on the ballot in any of these places, but in each one, Democrats ran against his policies and yoked their opponents to him.\n\nAfter similar results in New Jersey and Virginia eight years ago, Democrats nearly ran the table in the 2018 midterm elections. Democrats are already arguing that Tuesday was a harbinger for the 2026 midterms, while Republicans claim it was a blue-state blip.\n\nMamdani gives Democrats a new leader.\n\nIn a year's time, Zohran Mamdani has gone from searching for random New Yorkers to talk to him to becoming one of the biggest stars in American politics.\n\nNow the New York City mayor-elect at 34 years old, he represents the vanguard of Democratic politics. He is an unabashed progressive and a self-described democratic socialist who is sympathetic to the Palestinian cause.\n\nHe also offers a new strategic blueprint to a Democratic Party that has for a decade been defined primarily by its opposition to Mr. Trump.\n\nMr. Mamdani, in defeating Mr. Cuomo in both the primary and general elections, gave New York voters a clear alternative with a defined vision. He focused relentlessly on the cost of living, spoke endlessly about the prices of nearly everything and expressed an adoration for New York City that few other politicians show for the places they call home.\n\nAnd he did it by blazing a creative, compelling path online, both through his own social media channels and his appearances with scores of influencers and podcasters.\n\nMr. Mamdani's progressive politics may not play as well outside New York City, and Republicans have already signaled they will seek to tie the party's candidates to a Muslim immigrant, but Democrats running in the midterm elections are likely to copy his tactics and message discipline.\n\nEven Democrats will shrug at a scandal.\n\nIn the final weeks of Virginia's campaign for attorney general, it was revealed that Jay Jones, the Democratic nominee, had sent violent text messages about a political rival and had been caught driving 116 miles per hour.\n\nBut no prominent Virginia Democrat called for him to quit the race. Mr. Jones apologized, withstood a torrent of attack ads and rode huge Democratic turnout to victory.\n\nThe post-shame era continues apace.\n\nSuch was the antipathy toward Republican candidates in Virginia that Mr. Jones, even saddled with controversy, performed better than Vice President Kamala Harris did last year in Loudoun County, a key exurb of Washington.\n\nMr. Jones's political future might have a ceiling because of his scandals in this election, but for tonight, at least, he is as happy as can be.\n\nNo Trump on the ballot? Advantage, Democrats.\n\nMr. Trump drives Republican voters to the polls -- but only when he is on the ballot.\n\nDemocrats have overperformed in every nonpresidential election year since 2017. Their voters are now the ones who turn out for off-year and midterm elections, while Mr. Trump's loyal Republican base turns out in big numbers only in presidential years.\n\nThis played out this year in Wisconsin's Supreme Court race, when the liberal candidate prevailed by double digits, and in a series of special elections. It was again evident on Tuesday as Democrats prevailed easily in Virginia and New Jersey.\n\nMr. Trump will not be on the ballot in next year's midterm elections, but it is a safe bet that Democrats will again try to make him the centerpiece of their campaigns.\n\nNewsom helped House Democrats, and himself.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom of California has been on a not-very-secret mission for national attention since before the 2024 presidential election.\n\nAnd with a blowout victory in a ballot measure to redraw the state's congressional map in Democrats' favor, Mr. Newsom helped his party's midterm chances and proved that he could turn out voters in a critical election.\n\nIn the short term, the nearly two-to-one margin for \"yes\" on California's ballot measure may serve as fuel for Democrats in other blue states weighing their own redistricting plans. In his victory remarks, Mr. Newsom made an explicit call for other states -- including ones with ambitious Democratic governors, like Colorado, Illinois and Maryland -- to follow California's lead on redistricting before the midterm elections.\n\nAhead of the next presidential contest, it provides Mr. Newsom with concrete evidence of what he did to combat Mr. Trump in an era when Democratic voters are hungry for fighters.\n\nHow he uses that platform remains to be seen, but it is not much of a mystery where his ambition lies.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/05/us/politics/election-takeaways-democrats.html"}

Texas' move and California's response have kicked off a flurry of redistricting efforts around the country, with Republican states appearing to have an edge. Deeply blue California is Democrats' best opportunity to make up seats.\n\nMidterm elections typically punish the party in the White House, and Trump is fighting to maintain his party's slim House majority. Republicans hold 219 seats to Democrats' 213.\n\nTuesday's results mark a political victory for Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, who cast the measure as an essential tool to fight back against Trump and protect American democracy.\n\nMeasure supported by Newsom, Obama\n\nCalifornia's Proposition 50 asked voters to suspend House maps drawn by an independent commission and replace them with rejiggered districts adopted by the Democratic-controlled Legislature. Those new districts would be in place for the 2026, 2028 and 2030 elections.\n\nThe recast districts aim to dilute Republican voters' power, in one case by uniting rural, conservative-leaning parts of far northern California with Marin County, a famously liberal coastal stronghold across the Golden Gate Bridge from San Francisco.\n\nThe measure was spearheaded by Newsom, who threw the weight of his political operation behind it in a major test of his mettle ahead of a potential 2028 presidential campaign. Former President Barack Obama urged voters to pass it as well.\n\nNewsom sought to nationalize the campaign, depicting the proposal as a counterweight to all things Trump.\n\n\"Republicans want to steal enough seats in Congress to rig the next election and wield unchecked power for two more years,\" Obama says in one ad. \"You can stop Republicans in their tracks.\"\n\nCritics said two wrongs don't make a right. They urged Californians to reject what they call a Democratic power grab, even if they have misgivings about Trump's moves in Republican-led states.\n\nAmong the most prominent critics was Arnold Schwarzenegger, the movie star and former Republican governor who pushed for the creation of the independent commission, which voters approved in 2008 and 2010. It makes no sense to fight Trump by becoming him, Schwarzenegger said in September, arguing that the proposal would \"take the power away from the people.\"\n\n\"I don't want Newsom to have control,\" said Rebecca Fleshman, a 63-year-old retired medical assistant from Norco in Southern California, who voted against the measure. \"I don't want the state to be blue. I want it to be red.\"\n\nA lopsided campaign foreshadowed the vote\n\nAfter an early burst of TV advertising, opponents of the plan struggled to raise cash in a state with some of the nation's most expensive media markets. Data compiled by advertising tracker AdImpact last week showed Democrats and other supporters with over $5 million in ad buys booked on broadcast TV, cable and radio. But opponents had virtually no time reserved, though the data didn't include some popular streaming services like Hulu and YouTube or mail advertising.\n\nThe campaign followed an unusual trajectory. A handful of Republican congressmen who will see their districts dramatically reshaped - and their jobs endangered -- mostly stayed away from the campaign spotlight. With opponents short on cash, Newsom and his supporters dominated TV screens in the critical closing weeks.\n\nTotal spending on broadcast and cable ads topped $100 million, with more than two-thirds of it coming from supporters. Newsom told people to stop donating in the race's final weeks.\n\nThe GOP congressmen -- Reps. Ken Calvert, Darrell Issa, Kevin Kiley, David Valadao and Doug LaMalfa -- will see right-leaning voters reduced and left-leaning voters boosted in their respective districts in a shift that would make it likely a Democratic candidate would prevail in each race.\n\nIssa issued a defiant statement, saying: \"I'm not going anywhere. I'll continue to represent the people of California regardless of their party or where they live. I'm not quitting on California.\"\n\nCalvert said Newsom engineered a \"power grab\" while housing costs, gas prices and taxes continue to strain family budgets. \"I am determined to keep fighting for the families I represent,\" he said in an email.\n\nAP poll finds voters motivated by political reasons\n\nProposition 50 won a swift and decisive victory, as the AP declared a winner when polls closed statewide. Early returns were strongly in favor of the measure, as were preliminary results from the AP Voter Poll, an expansive survey of more than 4,000 voters in California.\n\nRoughly 7 in 10 California voters said party control of Congress was \"very important\" to them, and those voters overwhelmingly supported the measure, according to the AP Voter Poll.\n\nAbout 8 in 10 California voters who supported the ballot measure said it was necessary to counter the changes made by Republicans in other states, while only about 2 in 10 said they supported it because it was the best way to draw maps, AP Voter Poll found.\n\nTrump, who overwhelmingly lost California in his three presidential campaigns, largely stayed out of the fray.

Those new districts would be in place for the 2026, 2028 and 2030 elections.\n\nThe recast districts aim to dilute Republican voters' power, in one case by uniting rural, conservative-leaning parts of far northern California with Marin County, a famously liberal coastal stronghold across the Golden Gate Bridge from San Francisco.\n\nThe measure was spearheaded by Newsom, who threw the weight of his political operation behind it in a major test of his mettle ahead of a potential 2028 presidential campaign. Former President Barack Obama urged voters to pass it as well.\n\nNewsom sought to nationalize the campaign, depicting the proposal as a counterweight to all things Trump.\n\n\"Republicans want to steal enough seats in Congress to rig the next election and wield unchecked power for two more years,\" Obama says in one ad. \"You can stop Republicans in their tracks.\"\n\nCritics said two wrongs don't make a right. They urged Californians to reject what they call a Democratic power grab, even if they have misgivings about Trump's moves in Republican-led states.\n\nAmong the most prominent critics was Arnold Schwarzenegger, the movie star and former Republican governor who pushed for the creation of the independent commission, which voters approved in 2008 and 2010. It makes no sense to fight Trump by becoming him, Schwarzenegger said in September, arguing that the proposal would \"take the power away from the people.\"\n\n\"I don't want Newsom to have control,\" said Rebecca Fleshman, a 63-year-old retired medical assistant from Norco in Southern California, who voted against the measure. \"I don't want the state to be blue. I want it to be red.\"\n\nAfter an early burst of TV advertising, opponents of the plan struggled to raise cash in a state with some of the nation's most expensive media markets. Data compiled by advertising tracker AdImpact last week showed Democrats and other supporters with over $5 million in ad buys booked on broadcast TV, cable and radio. But opponents had virtually no time reserved, though the data didn't include some popular streaming services like Hulu and YouTube or mail advertising.\n\nThe campaign followed an unusual trajectory. A handful of Republican congressmen who will see their districts dramatically reshaped - and their jobs endangered - mostly stayed away from the campaign spotlight. With opponents short on cash, Newsom and his supporters dominated TV screens in the critical closing weeks.\n\nTotal spending on broadcast and cable ads topped $100 million, with more than two-thirds of it coming from supporters. Newsom told people to stop donating in the race's final weeks.\n\nThe GOP congressmen - Reps. Ken Calvert, Darrell Issa, Kevin Kiley, David Valadao and Doug LaMalfa - will see right-leaning voters reduced and Democratic voters boosted in their respective districts in a shift that would make it likely a Democratic candidate would prevail in each race.\n\nTrump, who overwhelmingly lost California in his three presidential campaigns, largely stayed out of the fray. A week before the election, he urged voters in a social media post not to vote early or by mail - messaging that conflicted with that of top Republicans in the state who urged people to get their ballots in as soon as possible.\n\nIn a post Tuesday on his social media platform, the president called the state's voting process \"RIGGED\" and warned that it was \"under very serious legal and criminal review. STAY TUNED!\" Secretary of State Shirley Weber called it \"another baseless claim.\"\n\nDemocrats hope to pick up as many as five seats in California if voters approve the new boundaries, offsetting the five that Republicans are looking to pick up through their new Texas maps. Republicans also expect to gain one seat each from new maps in Missouri and North Carolina, and potentially two more in Ohio.\n\nCongressional district boundaries are typically redrawn every 10 years to reflect population shifts documented in the census. Mid-decade redistricting is unusual, absent a court order finding fault with the maps in place.\n\nFive other GOP-led states are also considering new maps: Florida, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana and Nebraska.\n\nOn the Democratic side, Colorado, Illinois, Maryland, New York and Virginia have proposals to redraw maps, but major hurdles remain.\n\nA court has ordered new boundaries be drawn in Utah, where all four House districts are represented by Republicans, but it remains to be seen if the state will approve a map that makes any of them winnable for Democrats.\n\nSiddhartha Deb, 52, has lived in the U.S. since he was 7 years old but he just became a citizen Tuesday. Immediately afterward he registered to vote at San Francisco City Hall and cast his ballot in favor of Newsom's measure.\n\n\"I don't like the way the Republican Party is basically trying to rig elections by gerrymandering,\" Deb said. \"And this is the only way, to fight fire with fire.\"", "url": "https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2025/nov/4/california-voters-approve-new-congressional-map-boost-democrats-2026/"}

In New Jersey, Democratic gubernatorial pick Mikie Sherrill easily beat back a strong Republican candidate she attacked for embracing Trump.\n\nIn California, Democrats won a ballot measure to redraw their congressional districts that they pitched as a check on Trump -- a response to the president's push to squeeze more GOP House seats out of red states.\n\n\"We were the barometer tonight for what the American public is feeling one year into Trump term two,\" Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Virginia) said in an interview. \"We basically sent a message that we can do a hell of a lot better than we're doing.\"\n\nIn New York City, meanwhile, democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani was elected mayor after a race full of surprises that thrust him to the center of Democrats' debates about the direction of their party. He clinched the Democratic nomination in an upset over former governor Andrew M. Cuomo, who then ran as an independent and received last-minute support from Trump. Mamdani impressed Democrats with his energetic, online-savvy campaign but worried others who are anxious about alienating moderate voters.\n\nRepublicans expected a tough political environment nationwide this year as polls showed voters souring on Trump, though some had been hopeful about springing an upset or two. Democrats focused much of their marquee campaigns on the president, spending roughly $18 million on general election ads mentioning Trump in Virginia and New Jersey, while just $1.3 million of Republicans' ads mentioned the president, according to AdImpact.\n\nHere are some top takeaways:\n\nIn this article\n\nDemocrats won handily in New Jersey\n\nReturn to menu\n\nPolling heading into Tuesday showed a more competitive race than Democrats would have liked. But Sherrill wound up winning handily, just like Spanberger. Late in the night, Sherrill led by double digits with more than three-quarters of the vote counted.\n\nRepublicans had some reasons for optimism earlier. Their candidate, 63-year-old businessman Jack Ciattarelli, came within three points of defeating Gov. Phil Murphy (D) in 2021. New Jersey shifted to the right more than any state besides New York last fall. Democrats have controlled state government for almost eight years, and Ciattarelli blamed them for the high cost of living while arguing his opponent would bring more of the same.\n\nTrump endorsed Ciattarelli and held a telerally for him the night before the election. \"Your state has been wrecked by radical left Democrats ... now it is time for a change,\" he said on the call.\n\nBut Ciattarelli's failure to separate himself from Trump became a liability. Sherrill, a 53-year-old congresswoman and former Navy helicopter pilot, said she would stand up to the White House and attacked Ciattarelli for saying at a debate that Trump is \"right about everything that he's doing.\"\n\nOne especially awkward moment for Ciattarelli came when Trump said his administration \"terminated\" a multibillion-dollar rail tunnel project connecting New York City and New Jersey. Democrats blasted it as an example of Trump's harm to the state.\n\nAffordability was the central issue in the race. Sherrill said she would freeze utility rates on her first day in office, while Ciattarelli said he would lower taxes and also work to bring down energy costs.\n\nDemocrats swept in Virginia -- despite a text scandal\n\nReturn to menu\n\nDemocrats were expecting a good night in Virginia -- but it wasn't clear that would extend to their embattled attorney general nominee, Jay Jones. Jones won in the end as many voters unhappy with Trump set aside their concerns.\n\nJones's campaign was upended by revelations he fantasized in 2022 texts about killing a GOP legislative leader and former colleague. He imagined a scenario in which he had two bullets to fire at Adolf Hitler, Cambodian dictator Pol Pot or then-state House Speaker Todd Gilbert.\n\n\"Gilbert, hitler, and pol pot,\" Jones wrote in the texts. \"Gilbert gets two bullets to the head.\"\n\nDemocrats denounced the texts but mostly stood by Jones, hoping that backlash to Trump would pull him over the line anyway. Most Virginia voters disapproved of Trump, and 85 percent of those supported Jones, early exit polls showed. Forty-three percent of voters called Jones' texts disqualifying in early exit polls -- but some said they still voted for him.\n\nIn the governor's race, Spanberger -- a 46-year-old moderate who flipped a competitive U.S. House seat in 2018 -- will be Virginia's first female governor.\n\n\"We sent a message ... We chose our commonwealth over chaos,\" Spanberger said in her victory speech.\n\nIn the lieutenant governor's race, Democrat Ghazala Hashmi became first Muslim candidate elected statewide anywhere in the country. She led Republican nominee John Reid by about 10 points late Tuesday.\n\nTrump repeatedly snubbed Republican gubernatorial nominee Winsome Earle-Sears, 61, who would have been the first Black woman elected governor in any state. The president refused to formally endorse her and avoided saying her name on his election eve telerally for Virginia candidates, focusing instead on GOP Attorney General Jason Miyares, who sought reelection.\n\n\"Get out and vote tomorrow for Jason Miyares, so important -- and Republicans up and down the ballot,\" Trump said.\n\nCalifornia pushes back on Trump\n\nReturn to menu\n\nCalifornia's Prop 50 was voters' clearest opportunity to push back on the Trump administration, and it passed decisively. Democrats put it on the ballot as a counterweight to Trump's unusual effort to draw more Republican-leaning House seats before the 2026 midterms -- ahead of the normal redistricting schedule tied to the Census.\n\nProp 50 asked Californians to temporarily override their independent redistricting commission and draw a House map with five more blue-leaning seats. That's the same number of red-leaning seats Republicans added in Texas this year.\n\nDemocrats, led by California Gov. Gavin Newsom, made the ballot measure fight all about Trump. Adding five Democratic seats could make the difference in their bid to retake control of the House next fall -- though Republicans still have more opportunities nationwide to redraw the maps in their favor.\n\nRepublicans struggled to fight back in a state so opposed to Trump and wound up badly out-raised. Shawn Steel, a Republican National Committee member who was involved in the effort against Prop 50, said the spending gap became \"overwhelming.\"\n\n\"It's like the San Andreas earthquake,\" he said. \"The fault finally opens up, and you see this vast chasm right below your feet, and it's getting wider.\"\n\nYounger voters powered Mamdani\n\nReturn to menu\n\nMamdani, a 34-year-old state lawmaker, was widely expected to win the mayoral race in New York City. But the results give more insight into how Democrats feel about him.\n\nMamdani won two-thirds of voters under 45 in preliminary exit polls, while Cuomo led him by 10 points with voters 45 and older. The polls also showed an education divide: College graduates backed Mamdani by 55 percent, while voters without college degrees narrowly favored Cuomo.\n\nTwo million votes were cast in New York's mayoral race with 15 minutes remaining until the polls closed, according to the New York City Board of Elections, which said this was the first time 2 million New Yorkers voted in local elections since 1969.\n\nMamdani's candidacy has been divisive within the Democratic Party. Hakeem Jeffries, the House Democratic leader from Brooklyn, waited until the last weeks of the race to endorse Mamdani, while Senate Democratic Leader Charles E. Schumer -- another New Yorker -- never backed him. Laura Gillen, a Democrat from a battleground House district in the state, called him \"unfit\" after he declined to say that Hamas, the Gaza-based militant group, should disarm.\n\nOther Democrats have rallied behind Mamdani as a compelling new voice in a party struggling to excite its voters. They praised his focus on voters' economic struggles -- even as some disagreed with his solutions, such as government-run grocery stores -- and his creative use of social media.\n\nRepublicans see Mamdani's Democratic socialism as a valuable foil and are eager to make him the face of the Democratic brand. Trump has called Mamdani \"one of the best things to ever happen to our great Republican Party\" and threatened him with \"problems with Washington like no Mayor in the history of our once great city.\"\n\nMamdani's victory sets up a likely showdown with Trump. The night before the election, the president encouraged New Yorkers to vote for Cuomo and said that if Mamdani wins, \"it is highly unlikely that I will be contributing Federal Funds, other than the very minimum as required, to my beloved first home.\"\n\nBroad signs of trouble for Trump, Republicans\n\nReturn to menu\n\nDemocrats tried to make the election a referendum on Trump and hope that strategy will serve them well in the midterms, too. Republicans, anticipating a tough night, argued even before the results that it was hard to draw conclusions.\n\nMost Virginia and New Jersey voters disapproved of Trump and at least 9 in 10 of those people supported Democratic candidates for governor, exit polls showed. In the Virginia governor's race, about twice as many voters said their choice was meant to oppose Trump as the share who said their choice was meant to support Trump.\n\nOne encouraging sign for Democrats: They appeared to fare far better with voters of color than they did in last year's presidential election, when Trump won close to half of Latino voters and roughly doubled his support among Black voters to 15 percent.\n\nSherrill on Tuesday won more than 90 percent of Black voters and led by more than 30 points with Latino voters in preliminary CNN exit polling. Spanberger posted similar numbers.\n\nStrategists were watching New Jersey's Passaic County, a once-blue area with a large Latino population that flipped to Trump last year. Sherrill led comfortably late Tuesday with most of the vote counted.\n\nTheodoric Meyer, Alec Dent and Scott Clement contributed to this report.", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/11/04/democrats-election-wins-trump/"}

Newsom was happy to oblige.\n\nCalifornia \"could gerrymander like no other state,\" Newsom said July 9 as he sipped beers with a liberal interviewer on a swing through the South. In a clip of the interview he posted on TikTok, Newsom said he was rethinking the merits of his state's nonpartisan redistricting policy. The next week, after Trump briefed Texas congressional Republicans on redistricting during a July 15 call, Newsom escalated his threat on social media: \"Two can play this game.\"\n\nBut behind the scenes, Newsom and his Democratic allies had been less self-assured. They had begun exploring their own potential redistricting push, but unlike Texas, California had an independent redistricting commission they would have to get around. In June and July meetings in Sacramento, advisers told the governor he would likely need voters' approval for any change to the maps and would need to raise $100 million. The Democrats' chief mapmaker wasn't sure if drawing new lines could yield as many as five new Democratic seats to offset GOP gains in Texas -- or whether Democratic members of Congress would sign off.\n\n\"We didn't know that it was actually achievable,\" said Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-California), the chair of the California Democratic Congressional Delegation. But \"we didn't have the luxury to do anything else but focus.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, their efforts, and the risks they assumed, paid off as California voters approved Newsom's new map, Proposition 50, in a special election, the Associated Press projected. The Democratic victory marks a concrete response to Trump's political agenda less than a year into his second term. It gives Newsom, who many Democrats expect to run for president in 2028, a signature achievement to campaign on and a massive small-dollar fundraising list to tap. And it offers a party looking for ways to fight Trump's agenda a blue state road map for challenging him.\n\nThe nationwide redistricting battle is ongoing, with Trump-led efforts in other red states giving Republicans confidence about seizing an advantage when the dust settles. Some Democratic-led states are also trying to draw new maps, leaving the final outcome up in the air. The battle for the U.S. House majority is expected to be the marquee competition next year, with both sides looking for any advantage.\n\nCritics decried the governor's plan as a \"Newsom-mander\" and a \"power grab\" from political leaders who walked away from their onetime support of redistricting. Republicans were still drawing attention to the political risks for Newsom in the final hours before polls closed, with Rep. Doug LaMalfa (California) urging voters in video posted by the state Republican Party they should try to \"stop Newsom and his aspirations\" at the ballot box.\n\nThis story is based on more than two dozen interviews with members of Congress, congressional and political aides and Newsom advisers and confidants, many of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private conversations. Newsom declined to be interviewed.\n\n\"Ultimately it was the governor's call,\" said Jim DeBoo, a top Newsom strategist who managed the \"Yes on 50\" ballot campaign. \"It had to be a unified decision. In a situation like that, there can't be a lot of dissension. People have to jump off the proverbial cliff together.\"\n\nTexts, Zooms and a Trump-centric strategy\n\nIn the late spring, word was spreading around the Texas Capitol and in Democratic circles that Republicans were planning to redraw their congressional map. Texas Democrats reached out to Lofgren and House Democratic Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar (California) asking if their state was capable of a counter to the president's unprecedented mid-decade redistricting push.\n\nThey both called their redistricting expert, Paul Mitchell, who told them the idea was a nonstarter. Past legal precedent, he said, would make it futile to pursue any kind of mid-decade map drawing in the legislature and there was no reason to think voters would give up their popular nonpartisan commission.\n\nBut the conversation changed in July as the governor and California members began to feel a greater sense of urgency to counter the Trump-led efforts. Newsom's team began private research and polling to assess whether California voters would be willing to give up their independent process. They found that at least a narrow majority of Californians would back a ballot initiative changing the system if it was framed as a check on Trump's power -- a number that had potential to grow.\n\nIn late July and August, as they were still hashing out strategy behind the scenes, Newsom began promoting the argument. His team had built strong relationships with Democratic creators and social media influencers during the January fires and Trump's troop deployments in Los Angeles. Now, they were working closely with them to spread Newsom's message about Trump's moves in Texas to their millions of followers and viewers.\n\nThe strategy also enabled Newsom to nationalize the appeal at a time when Democratic activists and donors were desperate for a concrete way to fight Trump, ultimately helping him raise more than $38 million through 1.2 million donations from donors in all 50 states.\n\nIn private, Newsom involved himself in calls, texts and Zoom meetings with key California congressional Democrats -- Lofgren, former House speaker Nancy Pelosi and Aguilar, as well as the leaders of the California Senate and Assembly -- in late July and early August to shape strategy.\n\nHe sought advice from former president Barack Obama and Obama's attorney general, Eric Holder, who had both championed nonpartisan redistricting. He also consulted with House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (New York).\n\nJeffries and Newsom spoke by phone in mid-July, with the Democratic leader calling to thank Newsom for stating publicly that California was keeping all options on the table, an exchange that began what Jeffries described as \"an ongoing conversation.\" Around that same time, Jeffries made a public entrance to a private meeting of the California delegation -- conferring with Pelosi in full view of reporters.\n\n\"We understood that the first step was to try to get unanimity with the entire California congressional delegation, which is the largest in the country, and that's not an easy thing to achieve,\" Jeffries said. \"There's nothing more personal than people's districts.\"\n\nAt the delegation's meeting and on subsequent Zoom calls, members pressed Pelosi, the Democrats' most prodigious fundraiser, about whether they could raise more than $100 million that might be needed to win a California ballot campaign, which has no limits on contributions.\n\n\"We can raise the money, because we have to,\" Pelosi told them, according to several members.\n\nMap-drawing over 'chicken nuggets and Diet Coke'\n\nNewsom and his advisers worried that trying to engage voters on a subject as arcane as redistricting was a potential loser, particularly because California voters have tended to vote \"no\" if they are confused about a ballot measure. The governor also was not comfortable with abandoning the idea of California's nonpartisan redistricting commission, which he and many of the Democratic members of Congress had long supported. He and his advisers decided to present the measure as a temporary suspension of the independent redistricting commission's maps for three election cycles, hoping to mute critics.\n\nAt a meeting in late July, Democratic members of California's congressional delegation tapped Lofgren and Aguilar to pursue what was possible with the maps and whether they could forge consensus.\n\nMitchell, their chief redistricting expert, abandoned his plans for a vacation in Italy. He drove his wife and daughter to the airport, \"and I came home and got on a Zoom and didn't get off Zooms until two and a half weeks later,\" he said.\n\nThe tedious line drawing process unfolded over that period, including a day when Mitchell did 18 Zoom calls. While on the video calls with individual members -- and often Lofgren and Aguilar -- Mitchell looked at multiple monitors in front of him including a screen where he could see his staff redrawing the lines in real time as he discussed the changes with the members.\n\nEach change to one district created a domino effect of changes to others, requiring additional consultations with the members. Mitchell tapped a staff member in London to continue the mapping work at night while he and his colleagues slept.\n\nLofgren recalled joining video calls from 8 a.m. to midnight one day. Juggling other congressional and district business, Aguilar had his wife drive him around so he could be in the passenger seat on a laptop and he called into one Zoom at 1 a.m. from a delegation trip to Israel. Mitchell, who normally rides his bike 150 miles a week, barely made it outside and said he survived on \"chicken nuggets and Diet Coke.\" To prevent leaks, Mitchell only showed members and their staffs their portion of the map -- to prevent the overall map from becoming public before it was done.\n\nBy early August, the elements of what Pelosi described as a \"three-pillared approach\" were coming together. Democratic members of Congress had signed off on the new maps. California Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas and Senate Democratic leader Mike McGuire and other bill authors were drafting the legislation that they would introduce to set the ballot measure as soon as lawmakers returned to Sacramento on Aug. 18. On Aug. 21, both chambers passed the new map and accompanying legislation. Newsom quickly signed it into law, setting the election for Nov. 4.\n\nAn off-year campaign sprint\n\nAs soon as the legislation was signed, Pelosi, Newsom, Jeffries and other members began to push big donors, labor groups and Democratic organizations to start cutting checks -- sometimes for as much as $5 million. After forming the main campaign committee backing the ballot initiative, Newsom seeded the group with an initial $2.6 million from his own campaign accounts and he urged other donors to do at least as much.\n\nMany donors had been slow to give to Democratic causes, feeling burned by their party's steep losses in the 2024 campaign and others were skittish about giving at a moment when Trump has been so punitive toward his adversaries. But Pelosi, Newsom and Jeffries all argued in their fundraising calls that contributing to the ballot measure campaign wasn't just a one-time contribution. It would lay the foundation for Democrats to retake the majority in 2026, they argued.\n\n\"One of the things I said to all of them, was -- I don't want a win. I want a big win,\" Pelosi said.\n\nThe Trump administration, perhaps inadvertently, helped bring national attention to the Aug. 14 launch of Newsom's ballot measure campaign at the Democracy Center at the Japanese American National Museum in downtown Los Angeles when dozens of Border Patrol officers showed up outside the event. Clips of armed agents milling around outside the governor's event went viral, creating greater awareness about his Prop 50 campaign and juicing his fundraising effort.\n\nAt the outset, it appeared Newsom's ballot campaign was going to face a well-funded opposition. Stanford physicist Charles Munger Jr., a Berkshire Hathaway heir who had bankrolled the earlier ballot measures creating California's independent redistricting process, immediately announced that he would fight Newsom's effort. He wrote three $10 million checks in rapid sequence -- allowing his team to push out mail and immediately get up on the air with ads charging that Newsom's ballot measure would give power to the politicians.\n\nFormer House speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-California) and former California Republican Party chair Jessica Millan Patterson launched their own committee opposing Newsom's measure that was more explicitly aligned with Trump.\n\nBut the big spending some Republicans hoped to see never arrived. One hurdle they faced was skepticism among Republican donors that they could be successful in a state as blue as California at a moment of peak Democratic anger about Trump and his policies, according to two people familiar with the fundraising effort.\n\nTrump kept his distance from the contest, even as his political team worked closely with the Congressional Leadership Fund, the outside group aligned with House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-Louisiana), to help raise $25 million that was directed both to the McCarthy-aligned committee as well as the California Republican Party, which was overseeing the turnout operation. Late in the campaign, Trump posted on Truth Social to try to discredit the California vote, without presenting evidence for his claims.\n\nSome Republicans in California said they were privately frustrated by what they saw as an unfocused, disorganized opposition effort and campaign ads \"that looked like they were straight out of the 1980s,\" as one California GOP strategist put it.\n\n\"This was absolutely winnable,\" said Carl DeMaio, a Republican member of the California State Assembly. \"The Democrats messaging was simplified, emotional and very sharp. Our side basically went with a civics lesson approach.\"\n\nSeveral weeks before the election, public polling showed Newsom's side opening a clear lead. And in October -- at a moment when the state's 23 million voters had gotten their ballots -- data from AdImpact showed that the \"no\" side had gone dark on broadcast, cable and satellite and had no major ad buys reserved for the final weeks of the campaign.\n\nThe Newsom side saw Obama as their most effective surrogate and the ad he filmed stating that democracy is on the ballot Nov. 4 and that Republicans were trying to \"rig the next election and wield unchecked power,\" ran in heavier rotation than any other spot.\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump made it clear that the Nov. 4 election would not be the final phase of the battle. He called the redistricting vote in California \"a GIANT SCAM,\" adding that the measure and election results were \"under very serious legal and criminal review.\"\n\n\"STAY TUNED,\" he wrote.\n\nFor the last 11 weeks, Trump \"intentionally kept a low profile,\" said one person familiar with the president's strategy, but litigation is all but certain to follow: \"It's not over on Election Day.\"\n\nNewsom responded to Trump on social media Tuesday. \"The ramblings of an old man that knows he's about to LOSE,\" he wrote on X.", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/11/04/newsom-redistricting-california-prop-50-trump/"}

The passage of new maps in California represents the first and most significant swing back in favor of Democrats.\n\nRepublicans currently hold a mere three-seat majority in the House, and control of the chamber is the Democratic Party's best chance to take any power in Washington next year and thus thwart Mr. Trump's agenda in the second half of his second term.\n\nMr. Newsom and a parade of national Democrats had pitched the redistricting measure as a necessary maneuver by the left to counteract Mr. Trump's bending of the typical rules of political engagement. They called it the Election Rigging Response Act, purposefully naming it Proposition 50 in reference to the 50 U.S. states, symbolizing the nationwide scope of the fight.\n\nBut even more than that, Mr. Newsom aimed to turn the redistricting campaign into more of a partisan referendum on Mr. Trump than on gerrymandering, successfully taking advantage of California's political tilt to the left.\n\nThere are now legal, legislative and political fights over redistricting in more than a half-dozen states, including Indiana, Virginia, New York, Ohio, North Carolina, Missouri, Illinois and Florida.\n\nCongressional maps are typically reconfigured each decade, only after the census. But Mr. Trump has pushed Republican-controlled states to adopt partisan new maps that erase Democratic seats this year to improve Republican chances to keep power in the House. He has succeeded so far in Missouri, Texas and North Carolina. Democrats control fewer statehouses, and in some of those places, including California, they had previously ceded mapmaking authority.\n\nMore than a decade ago, California voters had stripped politicians of partisan mapmaking powers, handing control to an independent citizens commission. But Mr. Newsom persuaded state legislators in Sacramento this summer -- and ultimately the public on Tuesday -- to roll back those reforms. Voters agreed to rewrite the California Constitution, installing the heavily gerrymandered maps favoring Democrats until the next census in order to offset congressional Republican gains elsewhere.\n\nSupporters of the independent commission lamented the outcome, saying it was a mistake for the state to revert to partisan map-drawing after embracing a reform that created more competitive races.\n\n\"For what looms for the people of California, I am saddened by the passage of Proposition 50,\" Charles T. Munger Jr., a longtime champion of independent redistricting and the largest donor against the measure.\n\nMr. Munger, a Republican, added that Californians must ensure that the state will revert to having maps drawn by its independent commission after the 2030 census.\n\nMr. Newsom raised more than $100 million in three months for a campaign that cemented his status as one of the nation's leading antagonists to Mr. Trump, and his position as a serious potential Democratic presidential contender in 2028.\n\nHis office's all-caps social media posts that mocked Mr. Trump's caustic style with dripping sarcasm went viral. And Mr. Newsom's full embrace of battling -- and baiting -- Mr. Trump became a comforting salve for a Democratic base that has been crying out for a more full-throated response to a president seen by the left as fraying the basic fabric of democracy.\n\nEarly on, the redistricting ballot fight was expected to be highly competitive.\n\nMr. Munger, a physicist and heir to a business fortune who had supported the initial redistricting reforms in the state, poured more than $30 million into stopping Mr. Newsom. But his donations mostly dried up soon after Labor Day, and so did other funding against the measure.\n\nFormer Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican who had counted stripping politicians of their map-drawing powers as one of his administration's major accomplishments, publicly spoke out against the measure but did little else to mobilize opposition.\n\nBy October, Mr. Newsom and his allies mostly had the airwaves to themselves in a state where television ads are still king. All told, proponents spent roughly $99 million on advertising online and on television compared with nearly $39 million in opposition, according to data from AdImpact, an ad-tracking service.\n\nThe one-sided deluge caused Mr. Newsom to tell small donors to stop giving any more money more than a week before the election, an unusual declaration that showed how confident his team had become.\n\nThe closing ad in support of Proposition 50 distilled much of the strategy from Mr. Newsom's team: rallying Democrats to the polls in a Democratic state to stand up to Mr. Trump.\n\nIt featured former President Barack Obama, Mr. Newsom, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and even Representative Jasmine Crockett of Texas, a firebrand who has become a favorite of the progressive base.\n\nThe new maps approved by voters will significantly scramble California's congressional delegation, which is the nation's largest, with 52 members.\n\nFor three Republicans -- Representatives Kevin Kiley and Doug LaMalfa in Northern California, and Representative Ken Calvert in Southern California -- the political complexion of their districts has completely changed from safe Republican redoubts to relative Democratic strongholds.\n\nThe districts of two other Republicans, Representatives David Valadao in the Central Valley and Darrell Issa in Southern California, will become more competitive seats that Democrats hope to flip.\n\nBut all of that does not capture how thoroughly the new map favors Democrats.\n\nThe new lines also simultaneously strengthened the party's position in a half-dozen other potentially competitive seats held by Democrats: Representatives George Whitesides, Mike Levin, Dave Min, Derek Tran, Adam Gray and Josh Harder.\n\nThe new congressional lines approved under Proposition 50 will be in place for elections in 2026, 2028 and 2030. After the next census, California's independent redistricting commission will again be charged with drawing the state's maps.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/04/us/politics/california-election-prop-50.html"}

The last set of maps, drawn in 2020, was expected to be used until 2030.\n\nEarlier this year, at the president's urging, Republicans in several states started that process in the middle of the decade in an effort to defend the party's razor-thin majority in the House.\n\nTrump's push began in Texas in July, when he asked Republicans to schedule a special session to consider new maps.\n\nAfter a high-profile fight with the state's Democrats, which included dozens of lawmakers leaving Texas in protest, Republicans passed the gerrymandered maps and Gov. Greg Abbott signed off on the legislation in August.\n\nTrump then expanded his pressure campaign to other states, with Missouri and North Carolina following Texas' lead. Indiana is set to convene a special session in December to consider new congressional districts, and Gov.

A shift in the majority would imperil Trump's agenda for the remainder of his term at a time of deep partisan divisions over immigration, health care and the future direction of the nation.\n\n\"God help us if we lose in California,\" Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom says.\n\nDemocrats need to gain just three seats in the 2026 elections to take control of the House.\n\nHeavily Democratic California and its 52 congressional districts represent by far the Democrats' best opportunity in an unprecedented state-by-state redistricting battle, which started when Texas Republicans heeded Trump's demand that they redraw their boundaries to help the GOP retain its House majority. Democrats hold 43 of the state's seats and hope to boost that to 48.\n\nTrump is fighting not just the Democrats but history. Midterm elections typically punish the party in the White House, but four GOP-led states so far have adopted new district maps to pack more Republican voters into key districts.\n\nCalifornia's Proposition 50 asks voters to suspend House maps drawn by an independent commission and replace them with rejiggered districts adopted by the Democratic-controlled Legislature. Those new districts would be in place for the 2026, 2028 and 2030 elections.\n\nThe recast districts aim to dilute Republican voters' power, in one case by uniting rural, conservative-leaning parts of far northern California with Marin County, a famously liberal coastal stronghold across the Golden Gate Bridge from San Francisco.\n\nThe measure has been spearheaded by Newsom, who has thrown the weight of his political operation behind it in a major test of his mettle ahead of a potential 2028 presidential campaign. Former President Barack Obama has urged voters to pass it as well.\n\nNewsom has sought to nationalize the campaign, depicting the proposal as a counterweight to all things Trump.\n\n\"Republicans want to steal enough seats in Congress to rig the next election and wield unchecked power for two more years,\" Obama says in one ad. \"You can stop Republicans in their tracks.\"\n\nCritics say two wrongs don't make a right. They urge Californians to reject what they call a Democratic power grab, even if they have misgivings about Trump's moves in Republican-led states.\n\nAmong the most prominent critics is Arnold Schwarzenegger, the movie star and former Republican governor who pushed for the creation of the independent commission, which voters approved in 2008 and 2010. It makes no sense to fight Trump by becoming him, Schwarzenegger said in September, arguing that the proposal would \"take the power away from the people.\"\n\nAfter an early burst of TV advertising, opponents of the plan have struggled to raise cash in a state with some of the nation's most expensive media markets. Data compiled by advertising tracker AdImpact last week showed Democrats and other supporters with over $5 million in ad buys booked on broadcast TV, cable and radio. But opponents had virtually no time reserved, though the data didn't include some popular streaming services like Hulu and YouTube or mail advertising.\n\nTotal spending on broadcast and cable ads topped $100 million, with more than two-thirds of it coming from supporters. Newsom told people to stop donating in the race's final weeks.\n\nTrump, who overwhelmingly lost California in his three presidential campaigns, largely stayed out of the fray. A week before the election, he urged voters in a social media post not to vote early or by mail - messaging that conflicts with that of top Republicans in the state who urged people to get their ballots in as soon as possible.\n\nDemocrats hope to pick up as many as five seats in California if voters approve the new boundaries, offsetting the five that Republicans hope to pick up through their new Texas maps. Republicans also expect to gain one seat each from new maps in Missouri and North Carolina, and potentially two more in Ohio.\n\nCongressional district boundaries are typically redrawn every 10 years to reflect population shifts documented in the census. Mid-decade redistricting is unusual, absent a court order finding fault with the maps in place.\n\nFive other GOP-led states are also considering new maps: Florida, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana and Nebraska.\n\nOn the Democratic side, Colorado, Illinois, Maryland, New York and Virginia have proposals to redraw maps, but major hurdles remain.\n\nA court has ordered new boundaries be drawn in Utah, where all four House districts are represented by Republicans, but it remains to be seen if the state will approve a map that makes any of them winnable for Democrats.\n\n___\n\nCooper reported from Phoenix and Nguyen from Sacramento, California.", "url": "https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2025/nov/4/voters-california-take-prop-50-democratic-push-us-house-seats/"}

There's only one statewide question on the ballot, but there are numerous dynamics at play, political and otherwise. Here are five things we're watching.\n\nDoes Proposition 50 pass or fail?\n\nThe measure on the ballot is called Proposition 50, and the main issue at stake is whether Democrats can wrest up to five California congressional seats -- and potentially, control of the House of Representatives -- from Republicans.\n\nOrdinarily, the state's political maps are determined and drawn by a nonpartisan commission. But Gov. Gavin Newsom persuaded the Democrats who control the State Legislature to approve a ballot measure that would let state lawmakers redraw California's congressional districts to increase the chances that Democrats will win more of the seats.\n\nThe proposed shift was a response to President Trump's push to get Republicans in Texas and other states to redraw their maps to help his party keep control of the House. The measure in California could net as many as five congressional seats for Democrats.\n\nThe latest polling shows that Proposition 50 is likely to pass.\n\n* Here's what to know about voting in today's election.\n\nDoes the Justice Department's election monitoring go smoothly?\n\nThe Justice Department plans to monitor polling sites in five counties in California, a move that will likely heighten tensions on Election Day and in the days afterward during the vote-counting process.\n\nPersonnel from the agency's Civil Rights Division will be stationed at polling places and offices of registrars of voters \"to ensure transparency, ballot security, and compliance with federal law,\" the Justice Department said in a statement.\n\nElection monitors will be stationed in Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, Fresno and Kern Counties. Election monitors will also be present in New Jersey. The move by the Justice Department was prompted by complaints from Republican Party officials in the two states, which are led by Democrats.\n\nElection monitoring by the Justice Department is not uncommon when Americans go to the polls. But Democrats in California said the decision to put election monitors in counties with large percentages of Latino voters was a politically motivated effort aimed at suppressing the vote. The California attorney general, Rob Bonta, said the state would deploy its own observers, to monitor the monitors.\n\nShirley Weber, California's secretary of state, said her office \"will not permit tactics masquerading as oversight to erode voter confidence or intimidate Californians.\"\n\nRead more about the Justice Department's plans for election monitoring.\n\nHow do the results help or hurt Gavin Newsom?\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom's political fortunes are closely tied with the results of today's election.\n\nIf Proposition 50 wins, Newsom will be praised by Democrats on the national stage for pulling off a major victory against President Trump. If it fails, Newsom will have gambled and lost, having putting his political clout and brand as a Trump fighter on the line.\n\nNewsom said recently on \"CBS News Sunday Morning,\" that he will consider running for president after the 2026 midterm elections. If the ballot measure he has pushed for wins, it will give him a fresh foundation to build a presidential campaign on.\n\nHere's how Newsom turned this special election into a national platform for a possible 2028 presidential run.\n\nDo the ICE raids affect Latino turnout?\n\nThis Election Day is unusual in at least one significant way: It will take place while the Trump administration conducts an immigration crackdown that has upended life for many Latinos in parts of California.\n\nThe ICE raids have spread widespread fear in Latino communities. Some undocumented immigrants have effectively become shut-ins, avoiding going to work, church or to stores because they are afraid federal agents will detain and eventually deport them. Some Latinos who are United States citizens said they have started carrying their passports with them when they leave home in case they get pulled over.\n\nDemocratic officials and Latino voting-rights activists worry that the fear of ICE raids will dampen Latino turnout. Voter data of the turnout so far in California shows that Latino participation is roughly on pace with past elections.\n\nThere are signs that the administration's crackdown may be encouraging more Latino participation. Interviews with two dozen elected officials, voting experts and voters in California showed that the ICE raids were motivating many Latinos to cast ballots against Republicans and President Trump.\n\nRead more about how immigration raids are affecting Latino voters.\n\nIt's decision time for many after Tuesday. Who's in and who's out?\n\nWe're expecting a series of big decisions from several political figures in the state at some point after Election Day.\n\nSenator Alex Padilla, whose forcible removal from a Trump administration news conference in June resonated as a call to action for many Democrats, is considering joining the 2026 governor's race. He recently told The New York Times that he was weighing jumping in.\n\n\"But my focus is first and foremost on encouraging people to vote for Proposition 50,\" he told The Times's Lulu Garcia-Navarro.\n\nRick Caruso, a billionaire developer who spent more than $100 million in 2022 on an unsuccessful run for mayor of Los Angeles, has indicated he's considering running for mayor again or running for governor.\n\nOne of the state's top Democrats, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, is also weighing a decision on whether to seek re-election. Pelosi, 85, has not yet said whether she will seek another term in 2026 in the San Francisco seat she has occupied in Congress since 1987. She stepped down as the Democratic leader after the 2022 midterm elections.\n\nScott Wiener, a Democratic state legislator, announced he was tired of waiting for her decision and is running for her seat.\n\n* Here's what Wiener told our reporter about his decision to run.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/04/us/california-election-guide.html"}

The company was already under pressure from shareholders, including the activist investor Starboard Value, whose co-founder, Jeff Smith, joined its board in March.\n\nIn September, the Trump administration linked the use of Tylenol during pregnancy to autism, a connection that the company has strongly denied. That turmoil hovered over deal talks and helped Kimberly-Clark push for an agreement that valued Kenvue at a discount to its peers. (The transaction values Kenvue at $21.01 a share, only slightly above where the company was trading before word of the administration's plans emerged.)\n\nOne big question: Did the companies give federal officials a heads-up about the deal? That tactic, which has grown popular during the second Trump administration, may have bolstered executives' confidence.\n\nThe Kenvue deal is a bet that the markets have overreacted. Kimberly-Clark has long been interested in acquiring Kenvue, given its well-known brands and overlap in customers, people with knowledge of the deal told DealBook. Company executives told analysts on Monday that they worked with legal, health and government experts to do thorough due diligence.\n\nThey seemingly concluded that the cost and uncertainty of buying Kenvue were outweighed by the quality of the target company's brands -- and the price they would pay. (Among the winners of the deal were the many activist investors in Kenvue's stock.)\n\nMany shareholders in Kimberly-Clark seem to think that the company didn't get enough of a discount: Its shares fell down nearly 15 percent on Monday.\n\nKimberly-Clark probably can't cite litigation risk as an escape hatch. Regulatory filings by the company published on Monday showed that business pressures related to acetaminophen or talc, whose legal liability Kenvue has assumed from Johnson & Johnson, don't appear to qualify as acceptable reasons to walk away.\n\nHowever, there is a caveat to that carve-out in a disclosure letter by Kenvue that hasn't been publicly filed yet.\n\nThere could be other ways to kill the deal. Both Kenvue and Kimberly-Clark stockholders must vote on the transaction. But with a final deadline for closing set for the second half of 2026, shareholders most likely won't vote for months, according to Eric Talley, a professor at Columbia Law School.\n\n\"If Kenvue gets clobbered by Tylenol liability in the meantime, Kimberly-Clark stockholders are unlikely to approve the deal,\" Talley told DealBook. \"If Kenvue runs the table and escapes all liability risk, its own stockholders may bridle and vote the deal down.\"\n\nHERE'S WHAT'S HAPPENING\n\nDick Cheney has died. Cheney, who served as vice president under George W. Bush from 2001 to 2009, died on Monday at 84. A prominent conservative who embraced low taxes and pushed for a strong military response to the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, he later broke ranks with the Republican Party when he endorsed Kamala Harris over Donald Trump in the 2024 election.\n\nThe Trump administration reportedly blocks Nvidia's A.I. chip exports to China. Senior officials including Secretary of State Marco Rubio pushed President Trump not to discuss with President Xi Jinping of China a request by the chipmaker to sell its most advanced chips to Beijing, according to The Wall Street Journal. But Nvidia's stock rose 2.2 percent on Monday after Microsoft said that it had received an export license to ship the company's most advanced chips to the United Arab Emirates.\n\nOpenAI strikes a huge deal with Amazon. The ChatGPT maker agreed to buy $38 billion worth of cloud computing capacity from the tech giant over seven years, days after it renegotiated its relationship with Microsoft partly to reach such agreements. And Alphabet issued $25 billion in corporate bonds as it spends heavily on A.I.\n\nHawkish Fed comments spook investors. Stocks fell in Asia and Europe, as did U.S. equity futures, after two Fed policymakers cast some doubt about whether the central bank would cut rates again next month. Austan Goolsbee, the president of the Chicago Fed, said that persistent inflation meant that he was \"not decided\" about making another cut, while Lisa Cook, a Fed governor, said inflation and a slowing labor market meant that the central bank's decision was still \"live.\"\n\nNorway's sovereign wealth fund votes against Elon Musk's $1 trillion pay plan. Norges Bank Investment Management, the first major investor in Tesla to disclose how it voted, said that it was worried about the size, dilution and \"lack of mitigation of key person risk\" posed by the compensation package, which could be worth roughly $1 trillion if certain milestones are met. The carmaker is expected to announce the vote tally on Thursday.\n\nElection Day: What's at stake\n\nVoters head to the polls on Tuesday in New York and elsewhere in the country in a series of richly funded local races.\n\nPresident Trump has been a force, too. He fired off a volley of social media posts on Monday seeking to frame the races around the economy, immigration and crime, issues that helped him win the White House a year ago. He also endorsed Andrew Cuomo for New York mayor.\n\nThe outcomes could offer a litmus test on how Americans feel about Trump's continuing trade war and a federal government shutdown that seemingly has no end in sight.\n\nHere's what (and whom) to watch:\n\nIn New York City: Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee and front-runner, holds a wide margin in the polls over Cuomo, the former governor, and Curtis Sliwa, the Republican candidate. If Mamdani can score a decisive victory, could that augur a nationwide shift for the party toward tax-the-rich policy ideas that have spooked the city's business community and wealthy? And would Trump make good on his statement to cut the city off from federal funds if Mamdani wins?\n\nHere's who else has endorsed Mamdani and Cuomo.\n\nNew Jersey and Virginia are the sites of hotly contested governor races that have attracted big money from across the country. The New Jersey contest, pitting Representative Mikie Sherrill, a Democrat, against Jack Ciattarelli, a Republican, is expected to be the state's most expensive.\n\nPolitical analysts say a Democratic sweep -- and an especially strong showing by the party in the suburbs of Northern Virginia -- would serve as a rebuke to Trump and a sign of how voters in battleground states are leaning before midterm elections next year.\n\nThere's a lot on the line for California governor, Gavin Newsom. Proposition 50, Newsom's divisive gamble to redraw the state's voting district maps, has national implications (for him and his party). And it has attracted more than $120 million in donations, including from the billionaires George Soros, Michael Moritz and Reed Hastings. The haul shows Newsom's fund-raising prowess as he weighs a potential presidential bid in 2028.\n\nThat said, big-name donors to Newsom's previous campaigns, including Jeffrey Katzenberg and George Marcus, appear to be sitting this one out, according to Politico.\n\nCharles Munger Jr., the son of Charlie Munger, the longtime business partner of Warren Buffett, has emerged as the biggest backer of efforts to defeat Proposition 50. But, as a whole, the opposition has been vastly outgunned in donations.\n\n\"It's likely there'll be a 10 to 20 percent drawdown in equity markets sometime in the next 12 to 24 months.\"\n\n-- David Solomon of Goldman Sachs, predicting a market swoon at an investment summit in Hong Kong. Solomon is not alone; Jay Powell, the Fed chair, recently warned of \"fairly highly valued\" stock prices.\n\nA last gasp for the I.P.O. market?\n\nAfter a strong summer and early autumn, the I.P.O. market hit a snag when the government shut down, sidelining the S.E.C.\n\nSix initial public offerings raised $100 million or more in October, down from eight in the same month last year, according to data from the research and investment firm Renaissance Capital.\n\nThe S.E.C. offered companies a workaround, though, updating its guidance to allow new listing registration statements to become automatically effective 20 days after they were filed. Navan, a travel expense company, became the first to take advantage of the agency's new guidance last week.\n\nThe rule change laid the groundwork for a flurry of I.P.O. activity, with five I.P.O.s this week aiming to raise $100 million or more. Beta Technologies, an electric aerospace company, is the largest among them: It priced its initial public offering on Monday at $34 a share, above its expected range of $27 to $33.\n\nThat momentum is expected to slow. The S.E.C.'s workaround is best for companies already engaged with the agency. Both Navan and Beta had received comments from the S.E.C. on their filings before the shutdown, mitigating the risk of after-the-fact S.E.C. review.\n\n\"Soon the pipeline will run out of those names,\" Matthew Kennedy, a strategist at Renaissance Capital, told DealBook. \"A slowdown is inevitable.\"\n\nThere are other risks, too. The 20-day waiting period \"is like an eternity\" for companies navigating tumultuous markets, Alexander Platt, a securities law professor at the University of Kansas, told DealBook. And investors may be wary of backing companies that did not receive final approval from the agency.\n\nThere were signs that was the case for Navan, which was trading at $17 per share at the market's close on Monday, 32 percent below its initial offering of $25. As the government shutdown enters Day 35, that concern is likely only to further chill companies eyeing a public offering.\n\nTHE SPEED READ\n\nDeals\n\n* Starbucks agreed to sell up to 60 percent of its China retail operations to the private equity firm Boyu Capital for $4 billion.

What to watch on Election Day 2025", "description": "WASHINGTON -- Tuesday marks the nation's first major Election Day since President Donald Trump returned to the White House, and his leadership and policies dominated the debate in almost every race --...", "content": "WASHINGTON -- Tuesday marks the nation's first major Election Day since President Donald Trump returned to the White House, and his leadership and policies dominated the debate in almost every race -- even though the Republican was absent from the campaign trail.\n\nThe biggest contests are in Virginia and New Jersey, the only states electing governors this year. Trump lost both last fall, but voters in each have a history of electing Republicans for statewide office. The GOP candidates have closely aligned themselves with the president, betting that his big win last year can still provide a path to victory this time, even if the party occupying the White House typically suffers in off-year elections.\n\nStrong Democratic showings, meanwhile, could provide the party a pathway back to national relevance -- even if its top candidates have taken very different approaches, from adhering to a moderate line to wholeheartedly embracing government spending to improve voters' lives.\n\nIn New York City, a self-described democratic socialist who already has been a target of Trump's criticism could emerge as a national star if elected mayor. And California voters will decide whether to redraw the state's House map, as Democrats look to counter a push by Trump to reshape the balance of congressional power.\n\nHere's what to watch:\n\nThe president did not set foot in either Virginia or New Jersey to campaign with Republican gubernatorial candidates Winsome Earle-Sears or Jack Ciattarelli, but both contests will likely be viewed as a referendum on Trump's job so far.\n\nOver the last year, his tariffs rocked the global economy, his \"big, beautiful\" budget bill threatened rural hospitals and health insurance coverage for millions, he enacted massive cuts to the federal workforce and he sent the National Guard to multiple American cities.\n\nThe president endorsed Ciattarelli in New Jersey's governor's race, but held only a pair of tele-town halls on his behalf, including one Monday night. Trump also did an Election Night eve tele-town hall for Virginia Republican candidates, but he did not mention Earle-Sears, speaking mostly in favor of the GOP candidate for attorney general. Earlier in the campaign, Trump gave Earle-Sears only a half-hearted endorsement, saying he supported the GOP candidate for governor though he did not use her name. Earle-Sears was nonetheless a fierce defender of Trump and his policies, just as Ciattarelli was in New Jersey.\n\nDespite Trump's distance, a good night for Republicans would almost certainly be viewed as a political victory for Trump and his \"Make America Great Again\" policies. A bad night for the GOP would give Democrats a strong -- though perhaps fleeting -- start heading into midterms that are still a year away.\n\nTuesday offers a test of two very different Democratic philosophies on display from candidates: toeing a moderate line or fully embracing far-left progressivism. But it also presents a scenario where both, or neither, could be successful -- making drawing conclusions going forward more difficult.\n\nThe party's candidates for governor, New Jersey Rep. Mikie Sherrill and former Rep. Abigail Spanberger of Virginia, have focused largely on the economy, public safety and health care, distancing themselves from some of the Democratic Party's far-left policies.\n\nA growing collection of Democratic leaders believe the moderate approach holds the key to the party's revival after the GOP won the White House and both congressional chambers last year. Tuesday could be a key indicator of whether they're right.\n\nBoth Sherrill and Spanberger have downplayed their support for progressive priorities, including LGBTQ rights and resistance against Trump's attack on American institutions. Spanberger rarely even mentions Trump's name on the campaign trail.\n\nBoth also have resumes that might appeal to the middle.\n\nSherrill spent a decade as an active-duty helicopter pilot for the Navy before entering Congress, while Spanberger is a former CIA case officer who spent years abroad working undercover. They have played up their public safety backgrounds as a direct response to the GOP's attack that Democrats are soft on crime.\n\nAbove all, the Democrats have focused on rising costs such as groceries, energy and health care, which Trump has struggled to control.\n\nThat approach is far different from New York City's mayoral race, where progressives are energized by Zohran Mamdani, a 34-year-old Muslim state legislator who identifies as a democratic socialist and backs radical changes to address economic inequality.\n\nHis bold agenda and inspirational approach have attracted thousands of volunteers in New York and brought the likes of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to campaign on his behalf. It has also spooked some business leaders and voices in the Jewish community, who otherwise support Democrats but oppose some of Mamdani's past statements about personal wealth accumulation and Israel.\n\nMamdani has been locked in a caustic race against former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who is running as an independent after losing the Democratic primary to Mamdani. Republican Curtis Sliwa is looking for a huge upset.\n\nAnd while many progressives are thrilled, some Republicans in Washington are also quietly rooting for a Mamdani victory. Republican campaign committees have already launched attack ads against more than a dozen vulnerable House Democrats in New York and New Jersey linking them to Mamdani and his far-left politics.\n\nTrump endorsed Cuomo, posting online Monday evening: \"Whether you personally like Andrew Cuomo or not, you really have no choice. You must vote for him, and hope he does a fantastic job. He is capable of it, Mamdani is not!\"\n\nThat's after Trump derided Mamdani nearly every day. GOP operatives are also giddy about the opportunity to use him to attack many more Democrats closer to next year's midterm elections -- just as they have done with progressive Democrats such as House \"squad\" members like Ocasio-Cortez and Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar.\n\nElection Day comes in the midst of a federal government shutdown that has already spanned more than a month. Both parties in Congress blame each other, and there is no end in sight.\n\nWill it matter?\n\nVirginia is home to more than 134,000 federal workers, many of whom have been furloughed or are being forced to work without pay. New Jersey has nearly 21,000 federal employees, according to the nonprofit Partnership for Public Service, out of a total of more than 2 million such government employees nationwide.\n\nEither number is more than enough to swing a close election.\n\nAt the same time, millions of people may be losing critical food assistance from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, offering voters another urgent reason to express their displeasure.\n\nPolling shows that Republicans, who control Congress and the White House, are getting slightly more blame than Democrats -- though there is plenty of frustration aimed at both sides.\n\nTrump has taken the extraordinary step of calling on the Senate to scrap filibuster rules requiring a 60-vote minimum on major legislation to try and force the government to reopen -- even though his party's leadership considers that a nonstarter.\n\nWhile Trump lost Virginia and New Jersey last fall, there were significant shifts to the right in both states. In New Jersey, Trump's 16-point loss in 2020 shrunk to less than 6 points in 2024.\n\nThose shifts were fueled by Trump's increasing popularity among traditional Democratic loyalists: labor union members, Black men, Hispanic voters and younger people. Democrats are particularly vulnerable in New Jersey, which has among the largest percentage of labor union households in the nation.\n\nIf those pro-Trump trends continue this week, Democrats could be in trouble.\n\nBut Trump is not on the ballot, of course. And the Trump coalition -- especially lower-propensity voters -- has not typically shown up in the same numbers in non-presidential years.\n\nDemocrats are cautiously optimistic given that Trump did not campaign aggressively in either state, a move driven both by the president's weak standing and his allies' concerns about the Republican candidates' viability -- especially in Virginia.\n\nAt the same time, the biggest star in Democratic politics, former President Barack Obama, rallied voters in New Jersey and Virginia over the weekend.\n\nPennsylvania voters will decide whether three state Supreme Court justices supported by Democrats will serve another term.\n\nThe outcome may shape the seven-member high court in the nation's most populous swing state, and may have implications for key cases involving redistricting and balloting for midterm elections and the 2028 presidential race.\n\nThe incumbents aren't listed by party affiliation. The ballot merely asks voters to cast a yes-or-no vote. But spending on the race is likely to exceed $15 million, indicating how important it is to Democrats and Republicans in Pennsylvania and beyond.\n\nIn California, Gov. Gavin Newsom, frequently mentioned as a 2028 presidential hopeful, is leading a charge to redraw congressional maps to give Democrats as many as five more House seats in upcoming elections.\n\nThe push is the centerpiece of a Democratic effort to counter new Republican maps in Texas and elsewhere that were drawn to boost the GOP's chances in next year's fight to control Congress. In order for the new maps to count in 2026, however, voters will first have to approve a yes-or-no ballot question known as Proposition 50.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/trumps-strength-democrats-message-shutdown-effect-watch-election-127159112"}

New Jersey and Virginia have major governors' races ... New York City decides its next mayor ... Democrats' biggest redistricting push hits the ballot ...\n\nIt's Election Day.\n\nM...", "content": "In today's edition ... New Jersey and Virginia have major governors' races ... New York City decides its next mayor ... Democrats' biggest redistricting push hits the ballot ...\n\nIt's Election Day.\n\nMany of you will go to the polls today to vote in key races across the country. From bellwether governors' races to a redistricting proposal that could alter the congressional playing field, this year's races will have an outsize impact on next year's midterms. Here are the races to watch:\n\nCalifornia\n\nPolls close at 11 p.m. Eastern time.\n\nThe key race: A ballot question -- Proposition 50 -- on whether the state should change its congressional map.\n\nWhy it matters: Democrats, led by Gov. Gavin Newsom, are asking California voters to make the state's congressional map more favorable for their party. The proposition comes in response to Republican-led states, including Texas and Missouri, redrawing their maps to favor the GOP in response to pressure from President Donald Trump.\n\nIf approved, the new congressional maps could give Democrats five additional congressional seats in California, likely limiting Republican representation to the state's eastern interior. The race has become a referendum on Trump in a state Republicans lost by over 3 million votes last year; Democrats are increasingly optimistic the question will pass.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nPolls close at 8 p.m. Eastern time.\n\nThe key race: For governor, Republican Jack Ciattarelli versus Democrat Mikie Sherrill. Unlike in many other states, the lieutenant governor is elected on a joint ticket with the governor, and the governor appoints the attorney general.\n\nWhy it matters: New Jersey has gone blue in every presidential election since 1988, but Republicans are still optimistic. No party has held the governor's mansion for three terms in a row since 1961, and the current Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy has been blamed for New Jersey's staggering cost of living, an issue that's become a centerpiece for the race. Sherrill, a Navy pilot-turned-congresswoman, has distanced herself from Murphy.\n\nTrump performed better last year than any other Republican presidential candidate has in the state in decades, losing by only six percentage points. But Trump also influenced the race negatively: By withholding funding for the Gateway tunnel project connecting New Jersey to New York, the most economically significant infrastructure project in the state.\n\nCiattarelli, a state assemblyman, defended the move as a negotiating tactic but has acknowledged the project's importance to New Jersey. Sherrill won her seat in Congress in 2018 on an anti-Trump message. The results tonight could shed light on how salient that message is today.\n\nNew York City\n\nPolls close at 9 p.m. Eastern time.\n\nThe key races: For mayor, Democrat Zohran Mamdani, Republican Curtis Sliwa and Democrat-turned-third-party-candidate Andrew M. Cuomo. A number of ballot proposals will also be up, including one to move New York City elections to presidential years.\n\nWhy it matters: The New York City mayoral race has created an identity crisis within the Democratic Party nationally. Mamdani won his party's nomination with a democratic socialist message, vowing to expand housing, food access and health care in the city with one of the highest costs of living in the world. He would be the city's first Muslim mayor, and his past statements on Israel have drawn considerable controversy in the city with the largest Jewish community outside of Israel. Republicans have been quick to link Democrats around the country to Mamdani, and his democratic socialist positions have worried moderate Democrats who fear they could turn off independents.\n\nBut Mamdani has also energized the left in a way that could be a model for future Democratic campaigns. He has garnered the endorsement of mainstream Democrats including Gov. Kathy Hochul and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, who assert that the party is a big tent capable of holding politicians with various approaches.\n\nCuomo left the governorship in 2021 with a trail of controversies, from allegations of sexual harassment to his handling of the covid-19 pandemic. Still he has the backing of a coalition of moderate, pro-Israel and conservative voters. Trump reluctantly backed Cuomo in a \"60 Minutes\" interview that aired Sunday. Sliwa, who founded the Guardian Angels group that combated crime during the city's crime epidemic of the 1980s, rejected calls from Republicans to drop out to give Cuomo a better shot.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPolls close at 8 p.m. Eastern time.\n\nThe key race: Three Democratic Supreme Court justices in Pennsylvania -- Christine Donohue, Kevin Dougherty and David Wecht -- will ask voters for another 10 years on the commonwealth's highest court.\n\nWhy it matters: It isn't often that state judicial races get national attention, but in a political bellwether state like Pennsylvania, these contests have undeniable national implications, from abortion rights to redistricting to election law during the 2028 presidential campaign.\n\nThese Supreme Court elections are known as retention elections; the candidates aren't running against anyone, but rather are asking voters to allow them to keep their jobs. Democrats currently hold a 5-2 majority on the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, so the elections mean control is on the line. The races have attracted national spending -- both for and against keeping the justices. It is quite rare for a Pennsylvania justice to lose a retention race: The last time it happened was in 2005.\n\nTexas\n\nMost polls close at 8 p.m. Eastern time.\n\nThe key races: An open seat in Texas' 18th Congressional District, with 16 candidates vying for the seat.\n\nWhy it matters: The Houston-based district has been without representation for months following the death of Rep. Sylvester Turner in March. Today's election is a special election called by Gov. Greg Abbott, meaning there was no primary to winnow down the numerous candidates. If no one gets a clean majority of the votes, Abbott will have to call another special election for a runoff.\n\nNext year, the district will be redivided for March's primary races under the state's new Republican-led congressional map. A large majority of voters currently in the district will be drawn out. The new district lines will make the seat even bluer, meaning whoever wins today will still have an advantage next year.\n\nIt's unclear when whoever wins today's race will be sworn into the House. House Speaker Mike Johnson has not sworn in Rep.-elect Adelita Grijalva, who won her special election in Arizona in September. Johnson has kept the House out of Washington since late September to pressure the Senate into passing a Republican bill to reopen the government.\n\nIf a Democrat wins tomorrow as expected, Grijalva and the winner in Houston would place the Republican majority at 219-215 once sworn in, meaning Republicans could lose only one vote in future votes.\n\nVirginia\n\nPolls close at 7 p.m. Eastern time.\n\nThe key races: For governor, Democrat Abigail Spanberger versus Republican Winsome Earle-Sears. For lieutenant governor, Democrat Ghazala Hashmi versus Republican John Reid. For attorney general, Democrat Jay Jones versus Republican Jason Miyares.\n\nWhy it matters: The off-year statewide campaigns in Virginia have long been closely watched to decipher the nation's political mood. However, the state's races this year are more likely to serve as a barometer for how Democratic voters feel about the Trump administration's attacks on the federal government and the current government shutdown.\n\nSpanberger has had a consistent lead in polling and is expected to win on Tuesday night, flipping the governor's mansion four years after Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin won the job. A key question on Tuesday will be whether Spanberger's consistent lead is enough to keep Jones ahead of Miyares after the Democrat's violent texting scandal roiled the race.\n\nTexts Jones sent, including about shooting a political rival, forced Democrats to grapple with whether they would back a candidate who used violent rhetoric after having attacked Republicans for doing the same. The scandal has tightened Jones's race and threatens to make this year the first time in two decades that Virginia voters might split their tickets in the off-year statewide elections.\n\nGet ready with The Post\n\nIn your local paper\n\nThe Texas Tribune: Texans will vote on 17 ballot measures today, amending the state constitution on a host of issues, from capital gains taxes to parents' rights in their children's upbringing.\n\nPortland Press Herald: Mainers will vote on a ballot measure today requiring photo IDs to vote in future elections. Supporters say it improves election integrity, but opponents fear it'll disenfranchise Indigenous voters.\n\nDetroit Free Press: Detroit has a mayoral election today that blew up over the weekend amid allegations of corruption.\n\nSend us a reply\n\nToday is Election Day, the moment when our readers can officially voice their opinions about this moment and the candidates running in their states.

Gavin Newsom and former President Barack Obama -- have pushed for the new map.\n\nTexas Republicans, encouraged by President Donald Trump, revised their maps in a rare mid-decade redistricting move that could allow Republicans to gain five seats in 2026 -- and insulate the GOP from the historic midterm headwinds a president's party can face.\n\n\"We have a chance at least to create a level playing field in the upcoming midterm elections,\" Obama said during a recent call with supporters of the campaign to vote \"yes\".\n\nHannah Milgrom, a spokesperson for Yes on 50, the political committee supported by Newsom, told ABC News that the group has been working with over 230 community organizations on the ground.\n\nNational Democrats have largely supported the initiative, hoping it will be the first of other Democratic efforts to push back on Republican-led redistricting in Texas, Missouri, and other states.\n\nBut Rep. Kevin Kiley, a California Republican whose district would be reshaped and made significantly more Democratic-leaning, told ABC News partisan gerrymandering is a \"plague on democracy,\" and has unsuccessfully pushed House Speaker Mike Johnson to take up a bill banning the practice.\n\n\"I think it takes power away from voters, undermines the fairness of elections and degrades representative government,\" he said.\n\nSpokespeople for two of the political committees opposing Proposition 50, which are supported by megadonor Charles T. Munger Jr. and former Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy, respectively, told ABC News they were focused in the final weeks before the election on reaching persuadable voters and to emphasizing arguments about allowing voters to choose their politicians, not the other way around.\n\nActor and former governor of California Arnold Schwarzenegger, who supported independent redistricting as governor, has also spoken out against the proposition. He said in September, \"If you vote yes on that, you're going backwards.\"\n\n\"Prop 50 will have a big impact on the midterms ... the U.S. House margin right now is so narrow that every seat in every state could make a difference for which party controls Congress,\" Christian Grose, a professor of political science at the University of Southern California, told ABC News.\n\nIf the proposition passes, Grose added, a large margin of support could signal to Democratic donors that there's enthusiasm for the party -- and could impact whether other blue or red states decide to redraw their congressional maps as well.\n\nGrose said Democrats are likely more fired up in part because campaigning towards Democratic voters is how to win with ballot propositions in California, Grose said, but also because of what they see as national stakes: \"Democrats, maybe nationally, are viewing things as an existential threat; are viewing Trump as an existential threat. So anything that pushes back against Trump, anything that helps Democrats, is resonating.\"", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/californias-prop-50-congressional-map-election-major-impact/story?id=126909454"}

Gavin Newsom, House Democrats and state lawmakers. They wanted to counter Republicans in Texas and other states who were gerrymandering maps at the request of President Trump, who has engaged in a national redistricting effort aimed at keeping his party in control of Congress during the second half of his term.\n\nThe California ballot measure asks voters whether the state should suspend its independent process and adopt new congressional districts that are expected to favor Democrats, starting next year.\n\nWith recent polls indicating that the measure was likely to pass, Republicans all but abandoned the airwaves in the last stretch of the campaign. But turnout in California can be difficult to predict, especially in a so-called off-year contest like this one.\n\nHere's what you should know about the election:\n\nHow do I vote?\n\nPolls will be open Tuesday between 7 a.m. and 8 p.m. Pacific time. Voters who arrive by 8 p.m. should stay in line even after polls close because they still have the right to vote.\n\nYou can still mail in your ballot, but you have to make sure that it gets a Tuesday postmark for it to count. For that reason, election officials have advised last-minute voters to head to vote centers or election offices to be certain that their ballots are cast in time. That is particularly the case in rural areas, where changes at the U.S. Postal Service have slowed postmarking.\n\nYou can find your closest polling place through the California Secretary of State website.\n\nAs of Sunday, more than 6 million of California's 23 million voters had already submitted a ballot, according to the California Secretary of State's office.\n\nWhat if I did not receive a ballot?\n\nCalifornia still offers same-day registration, which allows you to use a provisional ballot to vote on Tuesday. You must head to your local elections office or a vote center to use this option.\n\nAfter a provisional ballot is submitted, registrars check to make sure that you are eligible to participate and have not already voted.\n\nWhen will we know the results?\n\nPolls will close at 8 p.m. local time. If the contest is lopsided, the outcome should be known on election night. If the results are close, it could be weeks before the race is called.\n\nWhat's on the ballot?\n\nProposition 50 asks voters whether the state should temporarily approve redrawn House districts for the next three election cycles. The proposed boundaries have been drawn in a way that would most likely lead to more Democrats being elected to Congress.\n\nThe state has 43 Democrats and nine Republicans in the House. Proposition 50 could help Democrats flip as many as five of the Republican-held seats. It could also help Democrats make several swing seats easier to win.\n\nThe ballot measure would restore California's independent redistricting process in 2031, when a commission would draw boundaries based on the 2030 census results and the criteria set forth in the State Constitution.\n\nWho supports the measure?\n\nMr. Newsom and Democratic state lawmakers placed Proposition 50 on the ballot in August to counter gerrymandering efforts in Texas and other states. Texas leaders enacted new maps at the request of Mr. Trump, who wanted to find ways for Republicans to retain control of the House and pass his agenda over the last two years of his term.\n\nMr. Newsom has argued that Democrats needed to respond by gerrymandering their own districts and giving their party a fighting chance in the 2026 midterms. Besides the governor and Democratic state lawmakers, supporters include labor unions, the progressive donor George Soros, House Democrats, former Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Barack Obama.\n\nWho opposes the measure?\n\nRepublicans oppose Proposition 50 and say that the state should retain the boundaries already drawn by its independent commission. Among the most notable opponents are former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a moderate Republican who championed independent redistricting in California; the state's Republican Party; House Republicans; and Kevin McCarthy, a former speaker of the House.\n\nThe opposition campaign received the bulk of its funding from Charles Munger Jr., who is a physicist and a wealthy heir of Charles T. Munger, partner of Warren E. Buffett at Berkshire Hathaway.\n\nThe younger Mr. Munger was a prominent backer of independent redistricting in California when voters installed it in two separate elections in 2008 and 2010.\n\nMr. Schwarzenegger and Mr. Munger have argued for years that voters should not allow politicians to draw their own boundaries or create extreme districts that benefit the party in power. They have made the case that competition in each district is healthy for democracy.\n\nRepublicans have already challenged Proposition 50 in court and have vowed to file more lawsuits if voters approve the measure.\n\nIs it as simple as voting with my party?\n\nMr. Newsom has argued that voting for Proposition 50 is the best way for Californians to stop Mr. Trump. Republicans have made it less about Mr. Trump and focused on calling it a \"power grab\" by California Democrats who want to draw their own district lines.\n\nSome groups have had a difficult time deciding which way to go.\n\nThe state's League of Women Voters branch and California Common Cause, two nonpartisan groups, initially opposed Mr. Newsom's gerrymandering idea because it bucked the principle of independent redistricting. But both groups later went neutral on Proposition 50. Common Cause's national board determined that Mr. Newsom's approach was acceptable because he was countering partisan redistricting in Texas.\n\nMr. Newsom has said that he supports independent redistricting in principle. But he argues that Democrats must fight fire with fire by gerrymandering districts where they can, even if it means suspending California's rules until the next census.\n\nSome California Republicans have said that they oppose mid-decade gerrymandering in all states, including the effort Mr. Trump instigated in Texas. For instance, Representative Kevin Kiley, whose district includes a long stretch of rural Sierra Nevada counties, has proposed legislation in the House that would block mid-decade redistricting across the country. If Proposition 50 were approved, Mr. Kiley would be among the most vulnerable House Republicans.\n\nMid-decade redistricting efforts have gone beyond Texas and California. Other states are pursuing changes that could benefit Republicans in House races, while Democratic-led states generally have a more difficult path to redrawing their boundaries before the midterms.\n\nLaurel Rosenhall contributed reporting from Sacramento.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/04/us/elections/california-prop-50-election-day.html"}

While only a handful of mostly Democratic-leaning states are voting, strategists in both parties will be looking for clues about how people feel about Trump's agenda and Democrats' rebuilding efforts before the country votes in the 2026 midterms.\n\nHere are five big questions for Election Day 2025:\n\nIn this article\n\nWhat message will voters send about Trump?\n\nReturn to menu\n\nWhile Trump is not on the ballot, Democrats have sought to turn the marquee races in part into referendums on his presidency, with polls showing his approval rating in negative territory.\n\nA large portion of pro-Democrat ads in the 2025 general election in New Jersey and Virginia mentioned Trump, according to data from AdImpact. Democrats spent nearly $18 million on general election ads there mentioning Trump, investing $34.4 million on ads that did not. By comparison, Republicans spent $1.3 million on ads in those states mentioning Trump and $37.7 million on ads that did not.\n\nThe Democratic gubernatorial nominee in Virginia, Abigail Spanberger, has argued that the cost of living for voters in her home state is too high, pointing in part to the president's trade agenda, U.S. DOGE Service cuts and the ongoing government shutdown. New Jersey Democratic gubernatorial nominee Mikie Sherrill rarely misses an opportunity to tie her opponent to the president. In California, Democrats have focused heavily on Trump, hoping to capitalize on blue state anger with the president to pass a new congressional map.\n\nDemocrats have spent nearly a decade campaigning against Trump in a range of elections. If they are successful Tuesday in races where they ran heavily against the president, it could fuel efforts to reprise the strategies in the midterms. If not, the outcomes might prompt calls in the party to focus their energy on other matters.\n\nThe election will also test Republicans' ability to overcome Trump's low approval ratings and appeal to his loyal political base. New Jersey GOP gubernatorial nominee Jack Ciattarelli, for example, has aligned himself with Trump but downplayed the president's role in the contest.\n\nThere are also questions about whether Trump's supporters -- which included an expanded coalition in 2024 after he made inroads with Latino voters, first-time voters and others -- will show up for Republicans when he is not on the ballot. Trump himself has not been especially active in this year's campaigns.\n\nWill Mikie Sherrill hang on in New Jersey, or will Republicans spring an upset?\n\nReturn to menu\n\nThe open race for governor of New Jersey has narrowed in recent weeks, with polls showing Sherrill leading Ciattarelli by single digits. Democrats have long hoped for a clean sweep of this year's governor's races. They hold a clear advantage in Virginia, but New Jersey is not a sure bet.\n\nThough New Jersey is blue-leaning, Ciattarelli has returned as a competitive candidate in the gubernatorial race. He outperformed pre-election polls and fell three points short of winning the race against incumbent Gov. Phil Murphy (D) four years ago.\n\nThis time around, Democrats are feeling the squeeze from voters who have soured on Murphy and the Democratic-controlled state legislature -- particularly over their handling of cost-of-living issues. In addition, their gubernatorial candidate in the open race, Sherrill, has been scrutinized for being too buttoned up on the campaign trail.\n\nCiattarelli, a businessman and former state lawmaker, is a former Trump critic turned supporter who is running with the president's endorsement. Sherrill, a Navy veteran who in 2018 flipped a House district held by Republicans for decades, is attempting to convince voters that she would be a change agent as governor, making an ambitious pledge to put a freeze on electric utility rates and stand up to Trump.\n\nIn the final stretch of the contest, both candidates have focused on the cost of living, deploying television ads highlighting their efforts to combat high costs in the Garden State. Sherrill pledged in a final ad of the campaign to drive costs down. And Ciattarelli similarly vowed to tackle unaffordability, saying, \"housing, tax and electricity bills are crushing the middle class.\"\n\nRepublicans are hoping Ciattarelli can capitalize on the inroads Trump made in the blue state in 2024. No state besides New York shifted more toward Trump than New Jersey. He lost by about six percentage points, compared to his roughly 16-point defeat in 2020. However, Trump's endorsement doesn't clearly spell good news for Ciattarelli's gubernatorial prospects, given that the president's approval rating is now underwater in New Jersey.\n\nHow much of a problem will Jay Jones pose for Virginia Democrats? Will Republicans capitalize?\n\nReturn to menu\n\nThe other high-profile contest Republicans are hopeful about is the race for attorney general in Virginia.\n\nRepublicans in the state have seized on the recent revelation that the Democratic nominee for attorney general, Jay Jones, sent text messages to a lawmaker in 2022 describing a hypothetical scenario of shooting the Republican speaker of the Virginia House and discussing urinating on the future graves of other political opponents. Jones has since apologized, but Republicans -- including Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, the nominee for governor -- have released ads seeking to tie Democratic campaigns to Jones's controversy.\n\nDemocrats have largely stood behind Jones, even as they condemned his texts -- worrying some in the party who want to draw a firm line against political violence and violent rhetoric, and prompting accusations of hypocrisy from Republicans.\n\nThe incumbent, state Attorney General Jason Miyares (R), has Trump's explicit endorsement. Miyares has been sharply critical of Jones.\n\nWhile Spanberger has held a 12-point lead over Earle-Sears in the latest Washington Post-Schar School poll, support for Jones dropped by five percentage points compared with last month, leaving him tied with Miyares.\n\nWill democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani cement his meteoric rise in New York?\n\nReturn to menu\n\nNo other politician this year has catapulted from relative obscurity to the national radar like Zohran Mamdani, a left-wing State Assembly member who polls show is favored to be elected the next mayor of New York on Tuesday.\n\nIn a race that also includes former New York governor Andrew M. Cuomo and Republican Curtis Sliwa, Mamdani, 34, has embraced social media to build a movement around his candidacy, zeroing in on affordability as a core message. He has championed ideas such as free public transportation, city-run grocery stores and universal child care, while also pursuing higher taxes on wealthier residents.\n\nIf he wins, party establishment figures who were slow to endorse Mamdani's candidacy are likely to face more questions about his governance. And his dynamic with Trump, who has suggested Mamdani would face \"problems with Washington like no Mayor in the history of our once-great city,\" while Mamdani has called himself \"Donald Trump's worst nightmare,\" will also be under the spotlight. Trump endorsed Cuomo on Monday.\n\nIn a Democratic Party desperate to elevate new and compelling voices, Mamdani's rise has been a refreshing development for some who see him as a strong communicator. But it's been cause for concern for others, who worry that GOP attempts to cast Democrats as extremists will be more effective with a prominent democratic socialist elected to lead the country's most populous city. Some have also been troubled by Mamdani's comments about Israel. Mamdani, who would become the first Muslim mayor of a city that has the largest Jewish and Muslim populations in the country, has said he does not believe Israel should exist as a Jewish state.\n\nAt the same time, Mamdani, an Indian American born in Uganda, has faced Islamophobic attacks from Republican lawmakers and commentators.\n\nWill Democrats land their most significant counterpunch against Trump on redistricting?\n\nReturn to menu\n\nCalifornia voters are set to decide on Proposition 50 on Tuesday -- a statewide ballot measure Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) is pushing that could serve as Democrats' first concrete counterpunch against Republican efforts in several states to redraw congressional district maps in their favor. Polls show it is favored to succeed. If it does, the state can bypass its independent redistricting commission and adopt a new map that could add up to five Democratic U.S. House seats.\n\nThe battle over redistricting in California has attracted massive spending and big-name surrogates, with Newsom's committee bringing in former president Barack Obama and other nationally known Democrats to star in ads supporting Prop 50 and framing the campaign as a way to fight Trump directly.\n\nThe strategy marked a shift for many Democrats, including Obama, who had previously advocated against partisan gerrymandering.\n\nWhile some opponents, including Charles Munger Jr., a Stanford physicist and Berkshire Hathaway heir, have spent considerable sums trying to defeat the measure, the money chase has been one-sided, favoring Newsom and his allies.\n\nThe election has no recent precedent, leaving open the possibility of a surprise. But Prop 50's advocates, including Newsom, have sounded confident notes. For Newsom, a win would also be a welcome accomplishment ahead of a 2028 presidential campaign many Democrats expect him to launch.", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/11/04/election-virginia-new-jersey-trump-democrats/"}

Here's What to Look For.", "description": "Voters on Tuesday will deliver an early judgment on President Trump's administration in the first set of coast-to-coast elections since he began his turbulent second term.\n\nContests for mayor of New Y...", "content": "Voters on Tuesday will deliver an early judgment on President Trump's administration in the first set of coast-to-coast elections since he began his turbulent second term.\n\nContests for mayor of New York, governor of New Jersey and Virginia, and a redistricting ballot measure in California have revolved to varying degrees around how the Democratic Party should rebuild itself and respond to Mr. Trump's power play in Washington.\n\nThe elections are predominantly in Democratic areas and battleground states, where the party's candidates have sought to harness anger about Mr. Trump while deflecting discontent about the state of the Democratic brand.\n\nWith the 2026 midterm elections set to decide control of Congress for the final two years of Mr. Trump's term, both parties will look to Tuesday's results to guide how they campaign for the next year.\n\nHere are five questions about the elections -- though given the pace of vote counting in some areas, not all of the answers may be available by the end of the night.\n\nCan Mamdani get to 50 percent?\n\nZohran Mamdani, the 34-year-old State Assembly member who in eight months has transformed from a political unknown to one of the nation's tentpole figures in Democratic politics, does not need a majority of the vote to become New York City's mayor.\n\nBut it sure would help his argument that the city is hungry for his progressive politics.\n\nThe latest polling shows Mr. Mamdani with support from just under half of the city's likely voters while holding a healthy lead over Andrew M. Cuomo, the former governor who is running as an independent after losing the Democratic primary, and Curtis Sliwa, the longtime civic gadfly running as the Republican nominee.\n\nMr. Trump on Monday endorsed Mr. Cuomo, a nod that may not help the former governor, given that New York City last year backed Vice President Kamala Harris over Mr. Trump by 36 percentage points.\n\nA decisive, majority victory by Mr. Mamdani would provide an electoral mandate for the progressive vision he and his democratic socialist compatriots have supported for years. They have called for tax increases for the wealthy to subsidize transportation and social programs aimed at lowering the cost of living.\n\nWinning big would also help Mr. Mamdani and progressive Democrats fight the argument within their party that his brand is toxic for the sort of voters who are expected to decide congressional majorities in the midterms.\n\nNew York City may have little in common with the suburban districts that will make up the political battlefields in 2026, and Republicans have already begun to try to make Mr. Mamdani the face of the Democratic Party and yoke him to candidates elsewhere. His margin on Tuesday may determine how much the party outside New York embraces him going forward.\n\nWill New Jersey and Virginia provide a rebuke to Trump?\n\nEvery four years, a year after the presidential election, voters in New Jersey and Virginia offer a test of how the newly elected president is doing.\n\nRecent history says they tend to not like what they see.\n\nOnly once since the Nixon administration have Virginians picked a governor of the same party as the president. And New Jersey, a reliably Democratic state in presidential races since 1992, elected Chris Christie a year into Barack Obama's first term and nearly ousted Gov. Philip D. Murphy four years ago.\n\nNow with Mr. Trump in the White House again, Representative Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey and former Representative Abigail Spanberger of Virginia are trying to ride Democratic anger about Mr. Trump to become their states' governors.\n\nIt is a playbook Democrats have used to great effect since Mr. Trump first took office in 2017 and again in the 2018 midterms. This year, predicted former Gov. Terry McAuliffe of Virginia, \"will be like 2017 on steroids.\"\n\nIs California the first major Democratic redistricting domino to fall, or the last?\n\nMr. Trump's summer demand that Texas redraw its congressional map to shift five districts from Democrats to Republicans handed Gov. Gavin Newsom of California a political gift.\n\nClearly itching to run for president in 2028, Mr. Newsom suddenly had a big issue to push in 2025: engineering California's own congressional redraw, aimed at flipping five Republican seats to Democrats while positioning his state -- and himself -- as the leader of his party's off-year resistance.\n\nPolls show that the ballot measure authorizing new maps is likely to pass, and Mr. Newsom has taken victory laps in the form of telling liberal donors to stop giving money. The question may be how many more blue states will answer the governor's August call that \"blue states need to stand up.\"\n\nLast week, Virginia Democrats voted to take the first step toward a spring redraw that could flip a few of the state's five Republican seats. There are moves afoot in Illinois, Maryland and New York, though the degrees of difficulty vary by state.\n\nThe margin in California's ballot measure -- which owing to the state's slow counting of votes may not be known for days or weeks -- will serve as a test of how much blue-state voters want to engage in the extraordinary mid-decade redistricting battle Mr. Trump instigated.\n\nThe answer will certainly be heard by Democratic legislators in states still weighing their options.\n\nWill the Trump administration intervene at polling sites?\n\nDemocrats like Gov. JB Pritzker of Illinois have warned that Mr. Trump could send troops to polling places to intimidate voters. Gov. Gavin Newsom of California floated the idea, disputed by ICE, that immigration agents might show up at precincts on Election Day. The Justice Department has said it will send election monitors to California and New Jersey.\n\nAs much as Tuesday's elections are a dry run for the midterms politically, they may also serve as a test for how a federal government bent on serving the president's political desires might work to tilt elections in his favor.\n\nOf course, recent voting patterns have shown that Democrats are far more likely than Republicans to vote early or by mail, so a broad effort by the federal government to scare Election Day voters could backfire -- though it seems unlikely to take place in deeply Republican areas.\n\nWho will control the Pennsylvania Supreme Court for 2028?\n\nThree justices who ran with the backing of Democrats are up for retention in Pennsylvania in an election that will determine the balance of the State Supreme Court through 2028 in the biggest swing state in the nation.\n\nThe state court has a 5-to-2 Democratic lean, and it has decided some major election-related cases in recent years. In 2022, it upheld the state's mail-in voting law. In 2020, the Democratic justices ruled that ballot drop boxes were permitted in the state. And in 2018, the court ruled that the state's congressional district map was a partisan gerrymander that \"clearly, plainly and palpably\" violated the state's Constitution.\n\nBut the election in Pennsylvania, known as a retention election, is a bit quirky.\n\nThe justices -- Kevin M. Dougherty, Christine Donohue and David N. Wecht -- campaign on their own, but they're confined to discussing only their judicial philosophy, and they cannot make political pledges or discuss cases before the court. And there are no opponents. Instead, voters in Pennsylvania simply vote \"yes\" or \"no\" on whether to retain the justices for 10 more years.\n\nIf the justices are not retained, Gov. Josh Shapiro, a Democrat, would nominate their replacement, but they would have to be approved by the State Senate, which Republicans control.\n\nThis could mean that the court remains deadlocked at 2-to-2 until 2027, when the three seats would again come up for election. That scenario would leave Democrats without a critical check on election litigation during the midterms, when Pennsylvania will host a key governor's race and several close congressional elections.\n\nWill the progressives prevail in other races for mayor?\n\nAlong with New York, a host of major cities will elect mayors on Tuesday. Incumbents are expected to coast to re-election in Atlanta, Boston, Cincinnati, Pittsburgh and Charlotte, N.C.\n\nNew mayors will be elected in Detroit, Buffalo and Jersey City, N.J., where former Gov. Jim McGreevey is vying to make a Cuomo-like return to public office.\n\nThe most interesting mayoral contests are in Minneapolis and Seattle, where mainstream Democratic incumbents are trying to fend off challenges from left-wing rivals in elections that will serve as a gauge for the mind-set of urban liberal voters outside New York.\n\nMinneapolis Democrats spurned two-term incumbent Mayor Jacob Frey in July, endorsing a democratic socialist, State Senator Omar Fateh. A month later, the party revoked its endorsement, citing \"substantial failures\" during its convention.\n\nIn Seattle, Mayor Bruce Harrell faces a challenge from Katie Wilson, a left-wing community organizer who placed first in the August primary.\n\nMr. Harrell is trying to become the first Seattle mayor to win re-election since 2005 while Ms. Wilson is vying to harness the progressive energy and anti-establishment anger coursing through the Democratic Party.\n\nAnd in Miami, 13 mayoral candidates, including former mayors and members of local political dynasties, are vying to make to make a Dec. 9 runoff, provided none of them win outright by receiving more than 50 percent of Tuesday's vote.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/04/us/politics/elections-new-york-new-jersey-virginia.html"}

A recent poll from CBS News shows that approximately 62% of likely voters will vote yes on Proposition 50.\n\nChristian Forte is chair of the Sacramento County Republican Party.\n\n\"You take everything with a grain of salt,\" Forte said. \"Sure, you feel like, 'Oh my God, we're losing,' but you just keep fighting. Donald Trump was supposed to lose in '16.\"\n\nThe two Proposition 50 campaigns have bombarded viewers with political ads. The \"no\" side focused on independent redistricting, while the \"yes\" side focused on President Trump.\n\nRepublican strategist Mike Madrid, who has campaigned against Mr. Trump, said this election has become a referendum on Trump.\n\n\"I don't think that 99% of the voters who voted and have shown up or will show up have looked at the maps,\" Madrid said. \"In many ways, a lot of voters have been waiting since November of 2024 to vote with their middle fingers against Donald Trump, and Prop. 50 is the best way to do it.\"\n\nNewsom and supporters of Proposition 50 said the measure is a counter to congressional redistricting in states like Texas that favors Republicans in next year's midterms. Proposition 50, if approved by voters, would mean that California adopts new legislatively drawn congressional maps that make five GOP-held U.S. House seats in the state more favorable for Democrats in next year's midterm elections.\n\nThe race has quickly become one of the most expensive ballot measures in state history, with more than $253 million raised, as of November 3, across both sides and supporters out-raising opponents by a 2-to-1 margin, according to the California Secretary of State website. The race has also cemented Newsom's status as the leading voice of opposition to Mr. Trump.\n\nAbout a quarter of registered voters have already cast their ballots in early voting as of Monday.

While most races are in Democrat-friendly territory, the outcomes could signal warning signs for both parties.\n\nIn Virginia's governor's race, former Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger holds a steady polling lead over Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears. Spanberger has positioned herself as a pragmatic problem-solver focused on energy, housing, and health care costs, while tying Earle-Sears to Trump's federal agency cuts that have affected Virginia's 140,000 government workers. Earle-Sears has countered by attacking Spanberger on transgender issues and pressuring her over Democratic attorney general candidate Jay Jones, who reportedly sent 2022 text messages about killing the then-Republican House speaker. The revelations have boosted Republican attorney general Jay Miyares's re-election chances. All 100 Virginia House of Delegates seats are contested, with Democrats hoping to expand their majority to enable congressional redistricting.\n\nNew Jersey's governor's race offers Republicans their most attractive pickup opportunity. Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill, a former Navy helicopter pilot, faces Republican businessman Jack Ciattarelli in his third gubernatorial run. Sherrill has branded Ciattarelli as the \"Trump of Trenton\" and vowed to resist White House policies on tariffs and abortion, though critics say she appears too choreographed. Ciattarelli argues New Jersey needs a governor who can work with Washington and has pledged to roll back sanctuary policies and lower property taxes. Recent polls show Sherrill leading by just 3 points as Ciattarelli gains momentum.\n\nIn New York's mayoral race, Democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani shocked the political world by defeating former Gov. Andrew Cuomo by nearly 13 points in the Democratic primary. The 34-year-old state assemblyman is running on an ambitious platform including free child care, city-run grocery stores, and a four-year rent freeze, funded by higher taxes on the wealthy. Cuomo is now running as an independent, while Trump called Mamdani a \"communist\" and threatened to withhold federal funds if he wins. Mamdani has divided Democrats, earning endorsements from Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez but not Chuck Schumer.\n\nCalifornia voters will decide on Proposition 50, Gov.

Dozens of residents -- many with their arms linked -- descended on the small Immigration and Customs Enforcement building where the family was being held, set up camp outside the razor-wire gates and tried to block authorities from removing the family from Durango.\n\nWhat set the protest apart from similar clashes between residents and immigration agents in Chicago, Los Angeles and other cities was Chief Current's determination that the masked federal agent involved in the scuffle had crossed a line and his request for an investigation. He said he even considered filing criminal charges himself against the agent.\n\n\"It appeared to be an out-of-policy and possibly illegal use of force,\" he said in an interview at police headquarters.\n\nThe scene from Durango, captured by fellow protesters and put on social media, was violent and jarring, but no more so than many others across the country. Several protesters, including elected officials and a Democratic congressional candidate, have been arrested or charged with federal crimes at immigration detention centers. American citizens have been whisked into unmarked vehicles and charged with resisting arrest or attacking officers, though the people arrested have maintained they did no such thing.\n\nProtesters, journalists and clergy have sued over federal agents' use of tear gas and crowd-control munitions against protesters. A U.S. citizen who was violently thrown to ground in Chicago has vowed to \"pursue all legal avenues\" against the agents involved.\n\nBut so far, no local prosecutors are known to have filed criminal charges against immigration agents.\n\nThat might change. At Chief Current's request, the Colorado Bureau of Investigation has opened an investigation into the incident in Durango, putting Democratic-led Colorado on a potential collision course with the Trump administration, which has threatened to prosecute any local officials if they charge federal agents carrying out President Trump's immigration crackdown.\n\nIn an interview, Chief Current said that rather than bring charges himself, he decided that state investigators were better equipped to handle thorny legal questions of whether the agent had broken any laws, or could even be prosecuted in Colorado.\n\nFederal agents have broad legal protections, and the Trump administration has argued that the Constitution puts federal officers out of reach of state laws when they are carrying out their duties.\n\nStill, the Colorado Bureau of Investigation said it was investigating any \"state criminal law violations during the incident,\" and would send its findings to local prosecutors to make a decision about whether to file any charges.\n\nThe Colorado Bureau of Investigation declined to comment further. The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nSean Murray, the district attorney in Durango, said that before he made a decision about filing any charges, he would have to weigh whether laws were violated and whether the agent had immunity. If he did file a charge, he said he expected it would prompt reams of litigation.\n\nLast month, when Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the former House Speaker, said local police could arrest federal agents who broke California law Ms. Pelosi's assertion provoked a furious response from the Justice Department. Todd Blanche, the deputy attorney general, called such an arresting \"illegal and futile,\" and fired off a letter to Gov. Gavin Newsom of California and Ms. Pelosi warning them to \"stand down or face prosecution.\"\n\nIn Durango, Franci Stagi, 57, the protester who was involved in the altercation with the masked immigration agent, said she supported Colorado's decision to investigate. The Times obtained videos which showed how the events unfolded from people on the ground, seen from multiple different angles.\n\n\"You can't go around and just do that indiscriminately,\" Ms. Stagi said. \"You can't pull somebody by their head.\"\n\nMs. Stagi, a retiree who lives a mountain life of hiking, skiing and van camping, had driven to the ICE building after she saw social-media posts last Monday about the arrest of the Colombian father, Fernando Jaramillo-Solano, 45, and his 12-year-old daughter, Jana, and 15-year-old son, Kewin.\n\nMr. Solano, his wife and their children landed in Durango about 18 months ago after fleeing political violence in Colombia, and applied for asylum, according to Enrique Orozco-Perez, a co-director of Compa\u00f1eros, an immigrant resource center in Durango that worked with the family.\n\n\"They felt a sense of security because their case is active,\" Mr. Orozco-Perez said.\n\nMr. Solano worked three jobs, and his wife did cleaning work, made empanadas and cared for the children in a rundown trailer park outside Durango. The family had no run-ins with local law enforcement, officials said.\n\nMr. Solano was driving Jana and Kewin to school that Monday when immigration agents stopped him at about 7:30 a.m. and pulled him from his car. He shouted to passers-by that his children were in the car.\n\nHis arrest turned out to be a case of mistaken identity, an ICE official in Denver later said during a court hearing reported earlier by The Denver Post. In Durango, Chief Current said he pressed ICE officials to at least release the two children from custody to reunite with their mother, but he was rebuffed.\n\nMs. Stagi said she does not attend many protests, but as a mother, she was outraged that two children could be arrested and held for more than 24 hours inside the ICE office that operates in a former carwash on the edge of Durango.\n\n\"They're little kids,\" she said.\n\nMs. Stagi's confrontation with the immigration agent -- who has not been identified by local law enforcement -- occurred at about 6 a.m. Tuesday, according to videos from the protest.\n\nThe masked immigration agent was walking through a crowd of protesters when Ms. Stagi approached him, phone in hand, and asked, \"You won't even show your face?\"\n\nThe agent hit her hand, knocking away the phone and possibly grabbed it. Ms. Stagi ran after him, saying, \"Dude, you can't take my phone.\"\n\nMs. Stagi said she reflexively touched the agent's back to get his attention. The instant she did, she said, he wheeled around, grabbed Ms. Stagi by the hair, put her into a chokehold, dragged her through the street and threw her down a grassy embankment.\n\nMs. Stagi said she realized in that moment she should not have touched the agent -- an action that experts in police use of force said could be used to argue that the agent was acting reasonably.\n\n\"It was a knee-jerk reaction,\" Ms. Stagi said. \"I'm 5-2. I'm not assaulting him. I was just looking for my phone. He crossed the line.\"\n\nThe protest again spiraled out of control later that day when more than a dozen federal officers -- some in military-style gear -- arrived to clear away protesters so agents could remove Mr. Solano and his children.\n\nVideos show officers pulling the protesters away from the fence surrounding the ICE building and cutting through chains that protesters had put around the front gates. Officers pepper-sprayed protesters and fired crowd-control munitions at them. Some protesters appeared to push officers and throw water bottles.\n\nChief Current said the F.B.I. had opened an investigation into the clashes, raising the possibility that some demonstrators could face federal charges. An F.B.I. spokeswoman in Denver declined to comment, citing the government shutdown.\n\nThe protest broke up not long after the family was driven away, but a painful rift remains in Durango.\n\nChief Current blamed \"bad decisions\" by ICE for creating the unrest, but he also said that some demonstrators had turned the protest into a riot. Activists in Durango accused the police and city officials of not protecting the city's residents, a charge leveled at other police departments dealing with the president's immigration crackdown.\n\n\"They watched this community get brutally beaten,\" Jay Conlon, a demonstrator, said. \"They stood by and watched.\"\n\nMr. Solano and his children were taken to a family detention center in Texas. They remained there on Monday, as politicians and activists in Colorado continued to call for their release.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/03/us/politics/durango-colorado-ice-protester.html"}

Andrew Cuomo, who's attempting a political comeback after resigning in 2021 because of sexual harassment allegations, which he denies.\n\nOut west, Gov. Gavin Newsom of California could get a boost in his march toward a likely bid for the 2028 Democratic presidential nomination. If voters approve the new congressional maps he's championing, it'll be a win for Mr. Newsom and Democrats against redistricting in Republican-led states. And in Pennsylvania, voters will decide whether to retain three Democratic justices on the state Supreme Court in contests that have drawn national attention.\n\nMr. Trump's influence looms over it all.\n\nWhile Tuesday's contests are unfolding on mostly Democrat-friendly turf, the contests could be a warning sign for both parties headed into the 2026 midterm elections.\n\n\"This is one of those things where you have to read between the lines as to the strength of the Democratic or Republican sentiment because all the elections are playing out in states where voters went for Kamala Harris,\" said John Couvillon, a pollster and political strategist. \"The question then becomes, are they near Democratic victories with Republican wins, or are they wipeouts?\"\n\nVirginia\n\nFormer Rep. Abigail Spanberger, a Democrat, has held a steady lead in the polls over Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears in the governor's race.\n\nThe winner will replace Republican Glenn Youngkin, who is barred from serving consecutive terms under Virginia's Constitution.\n\nMs. Spanberger has run as a pragmatic problem-solver, vowing to address the rising costs of energy, housing, and health care.\n\nMs. Spanberger has kept Mr. Trump front and center in the race, tying Ms. Earle-Sears to his policies, including the DOGE cuts to federal agencies and the firing of federal employees that have hit Virginia, home to over 140,000 government workers.\n\nMs. Earle-Sears has put Ms. Spanberger on her heels over thorny transgender issues, criticizing the Democrat for supporting biological men in women's sports and locker rooms.\n\nMs. Earle-Sears also has pressured Ms. Spanberger to demand Jay Jones drop out of the race for attorney general after reports surfaced that he mused in 2022 text messages about killing the then-Republican speaker of the Virginia House of Delegates.\n\nThe bombshell revelations have boosted Republican Jay Miyares's re-election bid and the GOP's hopes, as they look to avoid a statewide Democratic sweep and emerge with some bragging rights.\n\nIn the lieutenant governor's race, state Sen. Ghazala Hashmi has a slight polling lead over John Reid.\n\nPolitical insiders are also keeping close tabs on the Virginia House of Delegates.\n\nAll 100 seats are up for grabs. Democrats are hoping to expand their slim majority as they consider redrawing the state's congressional lines to make gains next fall.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nOf all the contests on the map Tuesday, the New Jersey governor's race might be the most attractive -- and attainable -- prize for Republicans. They're hoping to build on the gains Mr. Trump made in the traditionally deep-blue state during the 2024 election.\n\nOn the ballot: Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill, a former Navy helicopter pilot, and Republican Jack Ciattarelli, a businessman and former state lawmaker.\n\nBoth are pitching plans to tackle rising energy and housing costs -- but their visions, and their tone, couldn't be more different.\n\nMs. Sherrill has positioned herself as a center-left moderate.\n\nShe has been criticized for coming across as too choreographed and too canned on the stump, raising questions about whether the party's base, including minority communities, will turn out.\n\nMs. Sherrill has tried to harness the anti-Trump sentiment in the state by branding Mr. Ciattarelli as a Trump loyalist. She's called him the \"Trump of Trenton\" and warned that he's too weak to push back against what she describes as chaos and corruption from the White House. She's also promised to stand firm against Trump-era policies on tariffs and abortion.\n\nMr. Ciattarelli argues that New Jersey needs a governor who can work with the White House -- not against it.\n\nHe's pledged to roll back Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy's \"sanctuary\" policies and give local police more authority to cooperate with federal immigration agents, especially in targeting violent undocumented immigrants.\n\nHe also has vowed to lower property taxes and change the state's formula for funding K-12 schools.\n\nMr. Ciattarelli, who is running for governor for a third time, is carrying momentum into Election Day. The latest RealClearPolitics average of polls shows Ms. Sherill has a 3-point lead, but Mr. Ciattarelli has been steadying, gaining ground on her.\n\nAll 80 seats in the New Jersey General Assembly are also on the ballot.\n\nNew York City\n\nDemocratic socialist Zohran Mamdani has charted a far different and bolder course from Ms. Spanberger and Ms. Sherill, running a charismatic campaign centered on lifting the working class in a city that is home to more billionaires than anywhere else in the world.\n\nMr. Mandani's wishlist ranges from free child care to city-run grocery stores and a four-year rent freeze on roughly a million apartments. To pay for his vision, he unabashedly supports higher taxes on the wealthiest 1% and large corporations.\n\nThe little-known state assemblyman with a thin employment and legislative record shocked the political world by defeating Mr. Cuomo by almost 13 points in the Democratic primary.\n\nMr. Cuomo, in turn, announced he was running as an independent, and has been playing catch-up ever since. Republican Curtis Sliwa is also running in a long-shot bid.\n\nThe 67-year-old Mr. Cuomo has leaned into his executive experience, arguing that the 34-year-old Mr. Mamdani, born to Indian parents in Uganda, is not equipped to lead the city. He warns that Mr. Mamdani's socialist vision would harm the city.\n\nMr. Mamdani's rise has seized the attention of the political world. Mr. Trump, during an appearance on CBS's \"60 Minutes\" on Sunday, derided him as a \"communist, not a socialist.\"\n\n\"He is far worse than socialist,\" Mr. Trump said, warning it would be hard for him to release federal funds to New York if Mr. Mamdani is elected.\n\nMr. Mamdani has also divided the Democratic Party.\n\nHe notched early endorsements from fellow democratic socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders and \"Squad\" leader Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and, more recently, from Gov. Kathy Hochul and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries.\n\nYet key figures -- including Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer and other members of New York's congressional delegation -- have withheld their endorsements.\n\nOthers, including Mr. Jeffries, have pushed back against Mr. Trump and Republicans as they seek to cast Mr. Mamdani as the new leader of the Democratic Party.\n\nAsked over the weekend whether Mr. Mamdani embodies the party's future, Mr. Jeffries responded: \"No.\"\n\nProposition 50\n\nMr. Newsom is urging Democrats to fight fire with fire in California, arguing they must set aside traditional political norms to combat Mr. Trump.\n\nWith that as a backdrop, Mr. Newsom and Democrats are asking voters in California to pass a referendum that would replace the work of the state's independent redistricting commission with a more Democratic-friendly map.\n\nThe ballot question is Proposition 50 -- The Election Rigging Response Act.\n\nIt is a response to the Trump-inspired Republican push in Texas, where lawmakers broke with tradition earlier this year by adopting new congressional districts that could help the GOP net five seats and defend their slim House majority next fall.\n\n\"He is not screwing around,\" Mr. Newsom said of Mr. Trump on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\" \"He's changing the rules. He's rigging the game because he knows he'll lose if all things are equal. He did not expect California to fight fire with fire.\"\n\nSurveys show the referendum is likely to pass.", "url": "https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2025/nov/3/year-elections-tuesday-tap-voter-mood-coast-coast/"}

You might have heard about California's Proposition 50, a statewide referendum that, if passed, will redraw the state's districts to give Democrats up to five more seats in the U.S. Congress.\n\nPolling indicates that Proposition 50 is expected to pass, and Republicans have all but thrown in the towel.\n\nBut, of course, this Democratic redistricting is not happening in a vacuum. It's a response.\n\nRight now, Congress is closely divided, and the upcoming midterms are a chance for Democrats to break the Republicans' unified grip on Washington. Earlier this year, Donald Trump fired the first shot when he pressed Texas Republicans to gerrymander their way to five more House seats in a rare, mid-decade redistricting shake-up.\n\nIt was an overt attempt to skew the midterms toward Republicans and prevent Trump from paying a political price for an agenda that on a single day last month inspired millions of Americans to take to the streets to protest.\n\nSince then, Republicans in Missouri and North Carolina have bowed to Trump's call and redrawn their maps. The president has also been pressuring more states, including Florida, Indiana, Kansas and Nebraska, to follow suit.\n\nIn response to Texas, California Gov. Gavin Newsom led the charge to create a ballot initiative that would fully counter those congressional losses in Texas.\n\n\"Donald Trump does not play fair,\" Newsom told reporters in August. \"You've seen that happen over and over again, and I'm just not going to sit back and be complicit. I don't think the people in the state of California are going to be complicit.\"\n\nNewsom has told his fellow Democrats it's time to \"meet fire with fire,\" calling it a \"break-the-glass moment for our democracy.\" Newsom added, \"Look, identifying a problem is one thing. You gotta do something about it. This is about action.\"\n\nIt's exactly what we've been talking about on \"Velshi\" for months: fighters versus folders. Assuming good faith on the other side is a luxury one can no longer afford with the Republican Party in thrall to Trump.\n\nIt's important to note that Newsom's strategy here is aggressive, but it is not corrupt in the same way that Trump's partisan redistricting efforts have been. Newsom is not asking Democrats to go into a backroom and redraw the maps. He's putting it to a vote.\n\nThis is a referendum that will be decided by the voters of California, not a state legislature submitting to the fearful impulse of a ruler. It's also not permanent.

A year later, she wrote an analysis of what she called \"the aftermath of Nazi rule.\" She found the Old World lacking in civic maturity and commitment compared with her new home, the then-booming United States, noting that \"the peoples of Western Europe have developed the habit of blaming their misfortunes on some force out of their reach.\" She believed that her adopted country, by comparison, enjoyed a kind of clarity of public vision: \"With the possible exception of the Scandinavians,\" she wrote, \"no European citizenry has the political maturity of Americans, for whom a certain amount of responsibility, i.e., of moderation in the pursuit of self-interest, is almost a matter of course.\" Arendt wasn't celebrating a perfect America; rather, she was lauding a people who approached political life with an adult sensibility and a reserve of self-control.\n\nArendt, and any judicious observer, could not make the same assessment of America today.\n\nThe United States is now a nation run by public servants who behave no better than internet trolls, deflecting criticism with crassness and obscenity. The White House press secretary answers a question from a member of the free press -- a serious question about who planned a meeting between the American and Russian presidents -- by saying, \"Your mom did.\" The secretary of defense cancels DEI and other policies by saying, \"We are done with that shit.\" The vice president calls an interlocutor on social media a \"dipshit.\" The president of the United States himself, during mass protests against his policies, responds by posting an AI-generated video of himself flying a jet fighter over his fellow citizens and dumping feces on their heads.\n\nAnne Applebaum: Why Trump turned to the sewer\n\nThese are not the actions of mature adults. They are examples of crude people displaying their incompetence as they flail about in jobs -- including the presidency -- for which they are not qualified.\n\nThe republic will not fall because Vice President J. D. Vance has decided that swearing is edgy, and the juvenility of American public life did not begin with the Trump administration. But the larger danger under all of this nastiness is that President Donald Trump and his courtiers are using crass deflection and gleeful immaturity as means of numbing society and wearing down its resistance to all kinds of depredations, including corruption and violence. When the U.S. military kills people at sea and Vance, responding to a charge that such actions might be war crimes, responds, \"I don't give a shit what you call it,\" the goal is not just to boost Vance's hairy-chest cred; it's also to grind others down into accepting the idea of extrajudicial executions.\n\nThe collapse of a superpower into a regime of bullies and mean girls and comic-book guys explains much about why American democracy is on the ropes, reeling from the attacks of people who in a better time would never have been allowed near the government of the United States.\n\nFor years, Trump has attracted acolytes by being the patron saint of the third string, gathering people who seem to feel, for various reasons, that they were iced out of national politics. Some hold opinions too extreme for any but a Trump administration. Stephen Miller's odious views, including his echoing of Adolf Hitler's rhetoric and his accusation that the president's critics are terrorists, would make him a liability not just in any other administration but even at a family dinner, as remarks from some of his own relatives have suggested.\n\nOther Trump appointees, however, have used personal loyalty as the bridge across the chasm that separates their lack of ability from the jobs they occupy. The experiences of prior Trump appointees suggest that many of the current crew know they are in over their head, which could explain much about their churlish and unprofessional behavior.\n\nConsider the candid admissions of Stephanie Grisham, a press secretary in Trump's first term who later walked away from Trump. In 2021, she explained to New York magazine why she took the job in the first place.\n\nTo be fair, many reasonable people have the same kind of awestruck moment when they arrive in Washington. (I certainly felt overwhelmed many years ago when I showed up for my first day of work in the Senate.) But Grisham admits to a deeper insecurity: \"I thought that they\" -- the Trump team -- \"were the only ones who would ever get me there. My lack of confidence in myself as a single mother and someone who has made mistakes in my past, I thought, Well, this is my only shot. Nobody's gonna ever want me, really, but these people did. So I'll stick around.\"\n\nThis kind of private insecurity can manifest in public life as childishness and trollishness. Or maybe such behavior is simply a reflection of the man at the top. Like all schoolyard bullies, Trump is crude and surrounds himself with people who will not challenge him. Thus his appointees, instead of rising to their responsibilities as public servants, emulate their boss's shallow swagger. Instead of advising the president, they seek to placate him. Instead of showing leadership, they replace their own dignity with loyalty to Trump and do whatever it takes to stay out of the Eye of Sauron.\n\nWhatever the reason for their immaturity, the effect is miserable policy and a corroded democracy. The public is poorly served and does not get answers to important questions. Tariffs? Inflation? Immigration? Peace or war? Who's responsible for these choices?\n\nYour mother, apparently.\n\nThe corruption, mendacity, and incompetence of those in charge are perhaps less astonishing than the willingness of Trump's most loyal supporters to tolerate them all. By now, any other president would have been restrained by Congress or, as happened in 2020, by voters. In Trump's second term, however, his base seems almost eager to forgive him for anything, with the possible exception of his involvement with the deceased sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nBut Trump's popular support (which is probably firmest in the range of some 35 to 40 percent of the U.S. population but much higher within the GOP) is not as much a mystery as it might appear. Americans of all political leanings have been poisoned for years by memes and disinformation. They have marinated in the nihilism of a culture that regards everything with a kind of post-ironic glib dismissal. (As usual, The Simpsons was ahead of its time: A 1996 episode shows two teens at a music festival, where one asks the other, \"Are you being sarcastic, dude?\" The other, crestfallen, says: \"I don't even know anymore.\")\n\nPerhaps Trump's voters have become like the members of the administration, delighting in the crassness and obscenity that pours out of the president and his circle whenever they are challenged. The White House's approach to social media in particular, as my colleague Ali Breland wrote recently, \"now resembles the polemical, trolling, vicious manner of posting\" pioneered by white supremacists such as Nick Fuentes and his fans, who have become more visible participants in the MAGA movement during Trump's second term.\n\nFriedrich Nietzsche created a concept that can help us understand this political moment. He imported a word from French to describe a kind of deep-seated anger that goes beyond transitory gripes: ressentiment, a feeling that comes from a combination of insecurity, an amorphous envy, and a generalized sense of resentment. Citizens engulfed by this emotion want to bring others down to what they think is their own underappreciated station and identify scapegoats to bear the blame for their misfortunes, real or imagined. They are driven by grievance and a continual, unfocused sense of injury. Accordingly, they see politics as a way to get even with almost everyone outside of their immediate circle. A Trump voter put out of work during the 2019 government shutdown captured this mentality when she exclaimed: \"He's not hurting the people he needs to be hurting.\"\n\nSociologists and political scientists have long been aware of the effects of ressentiment on entire nations, not least because it is often a red flag: a marker of a society ripe for decay into authoritarianism. And that is where the danger lies in the juvenility and coarseness among both the Trump elite and its most loyal supporters, some of whom treat grave issues of national and even global importance as little more than raw material for mean-spirited jokes and obscene memes. This shallow behavior leads to a deadening of the moral and civic spirit that undergirds democracy.\n\nPeople who are willing to accept \"your mom\" as an answer to important questions are people who have already decided that democracy is a rigged game. The political process, for many of them, doesn't seem to be a means for solving common problems and developing solid policies. Instead, they treat it as just another opportunity to excoriate their fellow citizens. They may support candidates such as Trump (and the late Silvio Berlusconi in Italy, and the now-imprisoned former leaders Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines and Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil) not because they expect responsible government, but because such candidates promise to hurt the right people -- to humiliate them, impoverish them, and perhaps even shoot them.\n\nWhat can other American citizens do when faced with a government that offers trolling and obscenity as replacements for governing? How do people who care about democracy and the rule of law deal with fellow voters who keep electing a class of public officials who seem to be all id and no superego?\n\nPerhaps most important, other Americans should model the behavior they hope to foster in their friends and neighbors. Populist ressentiment is not necessarily produced by inequality. It's driven by a perception of inequality, a sense of being looked down on by others. It is a demand for attention and emotional engagement. But trying to answer that demand is a fool's errand: On social media, for example, some of Trump's voters seem especially enraged not by arguments but by indifference. The whole point of their trolling is to gain attention and then intimidate others.\n\nBoth online and in daily life, Americans who are part of the pro-democracy coalition should resist such invitations. Responsible citizens must hold themselves to a higher standard than officials who are acting like grade-schoolers. The national figures, from Trump on down, who put out rancid bait may do so because they want others to argue and lower themselves, and thus prove that no one holds the moral high ground. (Perhaps this is why Trump and so many of his supporters resort to whataboutism when confronted with their behavior.) When these leaders and their followers swear or behave rudely, they may hope and expect that others will do likewise.\n\nAs tempting as it is to trade punches to the groin, the better approach is to model mature behavior and demand it in return from people being paid to serve the public. When the White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt answered the journalist S. V. D\u00e1te's text-message question about who chose the location of a possible U.S.-Russia summit with \"Your mom did,\" D\u00e1te texted back: \"Is this funny to you?\" Leavitt then went full Regina George, calling him a \"far left hack\" and refusing to answer his \"bullshit questions.\" Leavitt later posted the exchange on X, where D\u00e1te responded: \"Feel better now? Now can you answer the question? Please and thank you.\" That's the only way to go: Ask the question, and then ask it again, and keep asking.\n\nRead: Steven Cheung is the voice of Trump\n\nThis is not Michelle Obama's \"When they go low, we go high\" argument. (Even she seems to have abandoned that strategy.) Rather, it is a recognition -- and a plea -- that the voters and candidates who wish to replace this current government must present themselves as stable, responsible, and adult alternatives to a claque of trolls and incompetents. (Even California Governor Gavin Newsom's troll-back of the president, as clever as it was, has run its course.) The right answer now to the faux-macho silliness of someone such as Pete Hegseth is not to produce clever memes and nicknames for the secretary of defense; it is to remind people that Hegseth is acting like a teenager and trying to distract Americans with idiotic slurs about fat soldiers because Pete Hegseth is terrible at his job.\n\nLike most things that require some adulting, this approach is emotionally unsatisfying. And it may not gain much ground if enough Americans have decided that they are satisfied with poop jokes as public policy. The \"No Kings\" protests, however, are an example of how people can mobilize to mock ridiculous behavior (and do so festively, even) without the mayhem that Trump and his lieutenants seemed to hope would arise.\n\nIn addition to marching, Americans who care about democracy must organize and vote in every election, no matter how small or local. And in their personal lives, people who want to restore maturity to national government must be clear with those around them, even if it means risking their personal relationships, that some things, such as glib schoolyard taunts and scatological nonsense from the commander in chief, are not acceptable.\n\nAmericans have learned that guardrails are easily destroyed. Restoring them will take time -- because they have to be repaired by each of us, one person at a time, making small but important decisions about how we want to live.", "url": "https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/11/trump-maga-insults-trolling/684786/"}

That's especially true in high-profile races for Virginia and New Jersey governor, New York City mayor and a California proposition to redraw its congressional district boundaries.\n\nMore than half of the states will hold contests on Tuesday. Here's a look at some of the major statewide and local races on the ballot:\n\nIn New Jersey, Democrat Mikie Sherrill and Republican Jack Ciattarelli are the nominees to succeed term-limited Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy. Sherrill is a four-term U.S. representative and former Navy helicopter pilot. Ciattarelli is a former state Assemblyman backed by Trump. In 2021, Ciattarelli came within about 3 percentage points of toppling Murphy.\n\nIn Virginia, Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears and Democratic former U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger look to replace term-limited Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin. While Spanberger has made some efforts to focus on topics other than Trump in stump speeches, the president remained a major topic of conversation throughout the campaign, from comments Earle-Sears made about him in 2022 to some of his more polarizing policies, such as the so-called One Big Beautiful Bill tax and spending cut measure and the widespread dismissal of federal workers, many of whom live in northern Virginia.\n\nTrump was scheduled to participate in telephone rallies for the candidates on Monday night.\n\nAs the only gubernatorial races held in the year following a presidential election, the contests have long served as the first major test of voter sentiment toward the party holding the White House. In every race for governor since 1973, one or both states have elected a governor from a party different than that of the sitting president.\n\nThe race to lead the nation's largest city features Democratic state legislator Zohran Mamdani, independent candidate and former Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Republican Curtis Sliwa.\n\nMamdani's comfortable victory over Cuomo in the June primary generated excitement from the party's more progressive wing and apprehension among the party establishment. Party leaders like Gov. Kathy Hochul and U.S. House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries eventually endorsed the self-described democratic socialist months after he won the nomination.\n\nThe winner will replace outgoing Mayor Eric Adams, who initially sought renomination as a Democrat. After losing the primary Adams opted to run as an independent, but dropped out of the race in September and eventually endorsed Cuomo. In February, the Trump Justice Department asked a court to drop corruption charges against Adams because the case impeded Trump's \" immigration objectives.\" Trump later said he'd like to see both Adams and Sliwa drop out of the race in an effort to defeat Mamdani.\n\nCalifornia voters will decide a statewide ballot measure that would enact a new congressional map that could flip as many as five Republican-held U.S. House seats to Democratic control.\n\nProposition 50, championed by Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, is in response to a new Texas map that state Republicans enacted in August as part of Trump's efforts to keep the U.S. House under Republican control in the 2026 midterms. The Texas plan, which could help Republicans flip five Democratic-held U.S. House seats, has sparked an escalating gerrymandering arms race among states to pass new maps outside of the regular once-a-decade schedule.\n\nControl of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court will be at stake when voters cast Yes or No votes on whether to retain three justices from the high court's 5-2 Democratic majority.\n\nPartisan control of the court could have major implications for the 2028 presidential race, since justices might be asked to rule on election disputes, as they did in 2020. Spending on Tuesday's contests is on track to exceed $15 million as Republicans have campaigned to end the majority and Democrats have responded.\n\nIf all three justices are ousted, a deadlock in the confirmation process to replace them could result in a court tied at 2-2. An election to fill any vacant seats for full 10-year terms would be held in 2027.\n\nVIRGINIA ATTORNEY GENERAL: Republican incumbent Jason Miyares seeks a second term against Democrat Jay Jones. Much of the fall campaign has focused on text messages suggesting violence against political rivals that Jones sent in 2022.\n\nTEXAS-18: Sixteen candidates hope to fill a vacant congressional seat previously held by the late Democratic U.S. Rep. Sylvester Turner.\n\nSTATE LEGISLATURES: Control of the Minnesota Senate and Virginia House of Delegates is at stake, while New Jersey Democrats defend their 52-28 General Assembly majority.\n\nBALLOT MEASURES: Maine voters will decide statewide questions on voting and a \"red flag\" law aimed at preventing gun violence. Texas' 17 ballot measures include constitutional amendments on parental rights and limiting voting to U.S. citizens. Colorado and Washington also have statewide measures on the ballot.\n\nFollow the AP's coverage of the 2025 election at https://apnews.com/projects/election-results-2025/.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/ballot-general-election-donald-trump-president-127122972"}

Gavin Newsom signed last month creating an Office of Civil Rights to help schools identify and prevent antisemitism. State lawmakers approved the legislation as political tensions have flared in the U.S. over Israel's war in Gaza.\n\nThe new law, which takes effect Jan. 1, doesn't define antisemitism but gives educators the impression that they could be charged with discrimination \"if they expose their students to ideas, information, and instructional materials that may be considered critical of the State of Israel and the philosophy of Zionism,\" according to the complaint.\n\nJenin Younes, national legal director of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, says the lack of guidance has a chilling effect on speech among educators.\n\n\"They censor themselves very broadly because they don't know what's going to get them into trouble,\" she said.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed on behalf of individual teachers and students in California public schools and the Los Angeles Educators for Justice in Palestine.\n\nIn the complaint, middle school science teacher Jonah Olson says students in his rural, largely Christian school district often ask him what it means to be Jewish. He responds in part by saying that his Judaism does not include support for the State of Israel, and now he fears that might violate the law.\n\nParents who are part of the lawsuit say they fear their children will be prevented from learning about differing perspectives on Israel, Palestine and the Middle East.\n\nStudents in public schools nationwide are generally protected against discrimination through state, federal and district policies, but supporters of the law say they needed to do more given a surge in harassment and bullying of Jewish and Israeli students.\n\nThe Anti-Defamation League, which supports the new law, said 860 antisemitic acts such as harassment, vandalism and assault were reported to the group last year at non-Jewish K-12 schools nationwide. The number is a 26% decrease from the previous year but much higher than the 494 reported in 2022.", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/california-law-jewish-students-antisemitism-challenged-free-speech-grounds/"}

This would usually be seen as a routine mission from the department's Civil Rights Division, which is tasked with ensuring federal election laws are followed across the country. But the precise areas of deployment, the absence of clear federal authority to oversee these specific races and the questionable pretext for their deployment all set a disturbing precedent that will likely expand during next year's midterm elections.\n\nIn late October, Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement that the election monitors are necessary \"to ensure the American people get the fair, free, and transparent elections they deserve.\" The Justice Department staffers in question will be headed to five counties in California, including Los Angeles County, and one county in New Jersey. According to the DOJ's release, the staffers will facilitate \"an open flow of communication between poll observers and election monitors to ensure that elections proceed with a high degree of security.\"\n\nBut under the Constitution, states are charged with conducting elections, with federal laws only rarely superseding that authority. The two states where DOJ observers will be present don't have elections with any federal component that would invite Bondi's intervention. California voters will decide whether to amend the state's constitution to shift control over congressional redistricting away from an independent commission and back to the state legislature. The move from Gov. Gavin Newsom comes in response to a White House-backed pro-GOP gerrymander in Texas earlier this year. While there are federal implications, it's still a statewide election. Meanwhile, New Jersey is holding state legislative and gubernatorial elections. In the latter, Democratic nominee Mikie Sherrill leads Republican Jack Ciattarelli in the mid-single digits in polling averages, but some surveys show a closer race.\n\nInstead, the Justice Department chose to involve itself in the proceedings only after a request from each state's Republican Party. The New Jersey GOP requested that DOJ staffers be present in Passaic County to \"oversee the receipt and processing of vote-by-mail ballots\" and \"take steps to monitor access to the Board of Elections around the clock.\" In the letter to Harmeet Dhillon, head of the DOJ's Civil Rights Division, the New Jersey GOP claimed this was necessary because of a \"long sordid history of [vote-by-mail] fraud,\" referring to an ongoing fraud case in a 2020 city council race. It's worth noting that Passaic County was a former Democratic stronghold that swung to Trump in 2024 -- and is home to a sizeable Latino community -- making it potentially crucial to Ciattarelli's victory.\n\nSimilarly, according to NBC affiliate KCRA, California GOP chairwoman Corrin Rankin wrote in a letter to Dhillon expressing concerns Orange and Los Angeles Counties that \"arise from their voter list maintenance practices -- Orange County is currently in litigation with the Department of Justice over its voter list and there are questions about the accuracy of the voter rolls in Los Angeles County, as well as that county's compliance with a settlement reached with Judicial Watch.\"\n\nThe ongoing litigation that Rankin referred to is being waged across the country after a demand from Bondi for states to turn over sensitive voter information including driver's license numbers and partial Social Security numbers. Among the six states facing Justice Department lawsuits is Pennsylvania; its Republican secretary of state, Al Schmidt, called the lawsuit \"unprecedented and unlawful\" and promised to \"vigorously fight the federal government's overreach in court.\"\n\nAs The Associated Press reported, the sudden interest in these specific off-season elections has experts skeptical about the Justice Department's decision and the effect of the monitors:\n\nIt's also true that the laws allowing federal election observers to be deployed at all are limited to ensuring anti-discrimination laws are upheld. And even then, the deployment must take place under a court order, which the administration lacks in both New Jersey and California.\n\nBut with Bondi and Dhillon running the show at the Justice Department under President Donald Trump, the usual rules may not apply. After all, working within the exact spirit of the law, let alone the letter, hasn't been this administration's preferred approach. Here, Bondi and Dhillon are following Trump's marching orders in his war on early voting and mail-in ballots. That will likely set up a clash with state election officials, especially when you consider that more than 80% of Californians voted by mail in 2024.\n\nCrucially, Dhillon has worked to invert the Civil Rights Division's priorities from ensuring access to the polls to using it as a tool that could hinder certain undesirable voters from casting ballots. The department's suggestion that the monitors will be working closely with poll observers recalls the army of GOP observers trained last year to add weight to Trump's frequent (and unproven) claims of voter fraud. And as my colleague Steve Benen noted last week, there's plenty of evidence that the MAGA acolytes are gearing up to be even more aggressive during the midterms.\n\nThe slew of election deniers now being put in place in key roles around the country, paired with the Justice Department's groundwork to suggest fraud without evidence, portends a much more fraught election experience this time next year. The federal election monitors on the ground in California and New Jersey likely will not affect the results of Tuesday's contests. But their presence both telegraphs a political message -- a show of force to rally their supporters and cow their opponents -- and could be used as justification for more overt intimidation in future elections.", "url": "https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/doj-election-monitors-california-new-jersey-are-setting-alarms-rcna240353"}

Doug Mastriano, who wove repeated criticisms of absentee voting into his unsuccessful gubernatorial campaign in 2022, acknowledged to Politico a year later that Republicans \"have to embrace no-excuse mail-in voting.\"\n\nThis fall, with voters deciding whether to retain three Democrats on the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, the state Republican Party has encouraged voters to request an absentee ballot.\n\n\"If there is even a 1% chance that you might miss the 2025 Election, sign up for a mail-in ballot today! It's quick and easy!\" the state party's X account posted recently.\n\nPennsylvania election data shows that in the 2024 presidential election, Republicans accounted for 34% of the total votes by mail, up from 23% in the 2020 race.\n\nJim Worthington, a business owner and Republican fundraiser in eastern Pennsylvania, has encouraged Republican candidates in the state to develop a robust vote-by-mail operation, warning them that not doing so could cost them an election.\n\nWorthington told ABC News that when Dave McCormick approached him for his support when he ran for Senate in 2024, Worthington told him that he \"would support him if he came up with a robust, paid-for vote-by-mail program, which he agreed he would.\"\n\nWorthington said the ensuing effort, which he said raised $13 million to support vote-by-mail, was \"one of the reasons he won, and it certainly helped [Trump].\"\n\nRepublicans in other states with off-year races this fall have been pushing vote-by-mail.\n\nJack Ciattarelli, the Republican candidate for New Jersey governor, touted in an interview with Fox News, \"We've had more Republicans return vote-by-mail ballots than ever before.\"\n\nThe California Republican Party has told voters on X, \"Don't wait until the November 4th deadline, MAIL IN YOUR NO ON PROP 50 BALLOT TODAY,\" referencing the ballot measure proposed by Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom that would redraw the state's congressional districts.\n\nSome experts cautioned, however, that Trump's warnings against mail-in voting could hinder the efforts by party members to push the practice.\n\n\"The Republicans have a two-fold problem. Number one, the base of the party only comes out when Trump is on the ballot. And number two, he's still telling people, don't use mail in ballots,\" Philadelphia-based public affairs executive Larry Ceisler told ABC News. \"So I don't know how they deal with that.\"\n\nThe White House did not respond to ABC News' request for comment.\n\n\"No mail-in or 'Early' Voting, Yes to Voter ID!\" Trump said last week in a social media post.\n\nWorthington said the rhetoric by Republicans in Pennsylvania is helpful, but limited in its effectiveness. Republicans must also convince low-propensity voters to vote by mail, he said.\n\n\"They require people knocking on their doors, going to them, following up, at least three or four visits, minimum, where you've got to continue to go back to them,\" he told ABC News.\n\nEfforts to boost mail voting by Republicans for next year's midterm elections must start soon, he warned.\n\n\"You just can't roll out a vote by mail program that's next spring and think you're going to make a big enough dent to get those numbers to where they need to be,\" Worthington said.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/republicans-encourage-voters-cast-mail-ballots-despite-trumps/story?id=126909397"}

The Trump administration faces a court order on SNAP ... You tell us your thoughts on nuclear testing ... but first ...\n\nWhere are we on redistricting?\n\nCalifornia voters head to the polls tomorrow to vote on Proposition 50, the extremely high-profile, aggressive push by Democrats to redraw the state's congressional maps. If voters okay the proposition, California Democrats could gain five new House seats.\n\nThe measure is a direct response to the Texas Legislature creating five more safe Republican seats to help protect President Donald Trump's party from losing the House majority next year.\n\nWhile the fight over Texas redistricting included a dramatic flight from the state by Democratic lawmakers amid threats of arrest and fines, the California measure appears on a much smoother path to passing.\n\nProponents of Prop 50 have vastly out-raised opponents, to the point where Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom asked donors to direct their dollars elsewhere. Republicans have largely stopped airing ads or fundraising in opposition to the measure, with Trump's campaign team concerned about draining money on a cause that appears lost, Hannah Knowles and Emily Davies reported.\n\nDespite early concerns among some Democrats that the measure betrays the party's principles, the party has rallied behind the cause, with leaders -- including former president Barack Obama and former vice president Kamala Harris -- campaigning for it.\n\n\"We are prepared, when necessary, to fight fire with fire,\" Harris said at a Los Angeles rally on Saturday that included other high profile Democrats like Newsom, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (Minnesota), Sen. Adam Schiff (California), Sen. Alex Padilla (California), Rep. Judy Chu (California), Rep. Jasmine Crockett (Texas) and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass.\n\nDespite Democrats' financial advantage, opponents of the proposition, who argue it is undemocratic and a flagrant dismissal of the state's bipartisan redistricting commission, assert that there is still a chance of beating it.\n\n\"While we are being significantly outspent, there are still millions of votes to be submitted, and the campaign will focus on communicating to persuadable voters and turning out supporters,\" Amy Thoma Tan, a spokeswoman for a committee opposed to Prop 50, told our colleague Maeve Reston.\n\nMid-decade redistricting has already expanded far beyond California and Texas. Missouri and North Carolina both used legislative action to each create one more Republican-leaning district. Indiana's General Assembly will meet for a special session today at the behest of Republican Gov. Mike Braun to draw new congressional districts, though the several state Republicans have been hesitant about backing the effort.\n\nOhio, as mandated by its state constitution, had to redraw districts this year. Its bipartisan commission created a map with two districts that lean further Republican -- one of which already leans Republican but is currently represented by Democratic Rep. Marcy Kaptur. The state adopted the map on Friday; Democrats accepted the map as others under consideration would have made for less competitive races.\n\nRepublicans in Kansas, Florida and New Hampshire are also agitating for new maps that would benefit their party.\n\nOn the Democratic side, lawmakers in Illinois, Maryland and Virginia have all have floated ideas for new maps to boost the number of Democratic seats. Virginia is the furthest along: Lawmakers there gathered for a special session to put their redistricting push in motion in time to affect next year's midterms.\n\nVirginia's Senate approved a constitutional amendment on Friday to allow the General Assembly to redraw congressional districts outside of the usual decennial bipartisan commission. The House approved the amendment earlier last week. Virginia's General Assembly has to approve the amendment again during its next session beginning early next year and voters will need to sign off on the redistricting plan in a statewide referendum. Virginia's governor and other statewide offices, as well as its House, are both up for election tomorrow.\n\n\"We only find ourselves in this position because Republicans know their agenda of raising costs, gutting American's health care, and stealing food from working families is disastrous,\" Courtney Rice, a spokesperson for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said in a statement of Virginia's redistricting push. \"The DCCC is thankful to Virginia's Democratic leadership and legislators for acting with swiftness, clarity, and resolve in this matter.\"\n\nMaryland has only one Republican district, represented by Rep. Andy Harris, a deeply conservative member who chairs the House Freedom Caucus. But many prominent state Democrats are skeptical about unseating him.\n\nBill Ferguson, the Democratic president of the Maryland Senate, warned redistricting would jeopardize his party by making Democratic seats in Maryland more vulnerable, and that any map that wiped out Republican-leaning districts would be open to court challenges. Maryland's legislature drew districts in 2021 that were later struck down by the state's Supreme Court as a partisan gerrymander.\n\n\"When we analyze where things are, it is more likely that in Maryland, if we move forward with this, that we would lose representation and not gain,\" Ferguson said in an interview with Fox 5 Washington DC. \"It's not hypothetical. ... We tried to do this in 2021.\"\n\nAndy Harris said in a statement that a redistricting push would blow back on Democrats, highlighting \"just how unfair and politically motivated Maryland's district lines have been for years.\"\n\n\"It seems that at least some of Maryland's Democrats have finally realized the inevitable -- the state's current congressional map is already gerrymandered to their advantage, and any mid-decade redistricting would only expose that fact further, and open the potential for a court-imposed nonpartisan map that could result in two or even three Republicans being elected,\" Andy Harris said.\n\nDuring the Saturday rally, Kamala Harris told supporters that other states would be impacted by the path California chooses during tomorrow's vote -- and called on other Democratic states to redistrict.\n\n\"People are watching what is happening here right now,\" Harris said. \"Other states need to step up, too.\"\n\nGet ready with The Post\n\nWhat we're watching\n\nFederal judges in Massachusetts and Rhode Island ordered the Trump administration to disburse SNAP benefits. But will they go out?\n\nThe administration has to report to both courts today on whether and how it plans to release funds for SNAP, the nutrition assistance program formerly known as food stamps.\n\nRoughly an eighth of Americans need the program to feed themselves and their families; benefits that were scheduled to begin going out on Saturday were paused due to the government shutdown.\n\nThe Trump administration claims it doesn't have the legal authority to make November SNAP payments with the government closed. The judges, however, asserted that the shutdown constitutes the kind of extraordinary circumstances that contingency funds held by the Agriculture Department are meant to cover.\n\nDespite the orders, the administration isn't making any promises. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins called it a \"lie\" that the department can unleash the funds, asserting Friday before the court orders that the contingency fund is only allowed to be used if the underlying program is funded through appropriations. She said Friday that \"we're looking at all the options\" in the event a judge ordered her to release the funds.\n\nTrump posted on Truth Social that the administration's lawyers \"do not think we have the legal authority to pay SNAP with certain monies we have available,\" but that he \"instructed our lawyers to ask the Court to clarify how we can legally fund SNAP as soon as possible.\" He said the cleanest solution was for Democrats to vote for the Republican government funding package and reopen the government.\n\n\"If we are given the appropriate legal direction by the Court, it will BE MY HONOR to provide the funding, just like I did with Military and Law Enforcement Pay,\" Trump wrote. \"The Democrats should quit this charade where they hurt people for their own political reasons, and immediately REOPEN THE GOVERNMENT.\"\n\nTrump recently called on Senate Republicans to abolish the filibuster to push the GOP's funding plan through. Doing so would be an enormous blow to a norm that has defined the Senate for years. It's not the first time Trump has asked the Senate to do so, but Republican leadership have consistently defended the filibuster.\n\nIn your local paper\n\nThe Spokesman-Review (Spokane, Washington): Cattle ranchers saw prices tank after Trump announced he would allow more Argentine beef on the U.S. market, angering ranchers who already have to navigate a challenging industry.\n\nFort Worth Report: A North Texas state Senate race is drawing millions of dollars from some of the biggest donors in the state, pitting a MAGA-aligned, Trump-endorsed Republican against a conservative backed by pro-gambling money.\n\nTimes of San Diego: Military bands scheduled to perform at a Fleet Week concert had to cancel due to the government shutdown.\n\nFrom you\n\nWe had a lot of visceral responses to Trump's announcement that the U.S. would resume nuclear testing. His announcement caused a lot of confusion -- will there be detonations? How will our adversaries respond? Energy Secretary Chris Wright clarified some of the ambiguity around Trump's statement, saying he did not expect actual warhead tests and detonations for now.\n\nMany of you wrote to us about your memories of the nuclear blast drills of the Cold War.\n\n\"I had a flashback. I remember hiding under a desk thinking we would be safe,\" Jeff Jensen wrote. \"Just the thought that this is starting again, is horrifying. To think my grandchildren will be living with the same fear is overwhelming.\"\n\nMary Ciriello said the drills, which felt useless at the time, would be an unneeded added stressor on children today.\n\n\"Nowadays everyone is completely stressed out, especially children. That this administration would even consider nuclear testing is abhorrent and dangerous, not to mention expensive,\" Ciriello wrote. \"Let's prioritize healthcare and feeding the hungry.\"\n\nBruce Lampe dismissed the nuclear tests as \"saber rattling theater,\" noting that the country is not at war with a nuclear power. Joanne Minuete said she could \"maybe\" understand if \"there are new designs that absolutely need testing,\" but did not agree with moves \"to show off just to let others know our capabilities.\"\n\nPatty Bodin, who previously worked in nuclear weapons testing with the federal government including during the final underground nuclear test in 1992, said the country has since \"developed sophisticated techniques for conducting subcritical nuclear experiments in order to gain the necessary information about the nuclear stockpile,\" rendering the sort of tests Trump appeared to suggest unnecessary.\n\n\"Given the enormous costs associated with actual nuclear tests I think it would be misguided to resume testing,\" Bodin wrote. \"It would take years to assemble the requisite cadre, perform necessary safety analyses and gain buy-in from the state of Nevada not to mention the implications for the world wide moratorium.\"\n\nSend us a reply\n\nOur colleagues Marianne LeVine and Robert Klemko recently wrote about the controversy over using inordinate amounts of tear gas to disperse protesters.

But races for governor in New Jersey and Virginia headline an Election Day that will provide a critical update on the state of the Democrats' rebuilding project and a preview of the fault lines in the 2026 midterm elections.\n\nThe 2025 races have been buffeted by many of the same forces that shaped the 2024 race, led by an affordability crisis that is pinching voters in cities, suburbs and rural areas alike. Unlike in the 2024 election, it is now Mr. Trump and his ambitious regime of tariffs that are seen as driving the economy.\n\nKen Martin, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, predicted in an interview that victories on Tuesday would help his party head into 2026 with \"a head full of steam.\"\n\n\"Where there were once strong headwinds against the Democratic Party, there now seems to be wind at our back and momentum for sure,\" Mr. Martin said. He insisted, \"it's not just an anti-Trump wave that we're seeing,\" but a powerful chord that Democrats have struck with their message on economics and affordability.\n\nOf course, its helps Democrats that the biggest contests are being held in states that Mr. Trump lost. The flip side is that any defeats in those states could be especially deflating.\n\nBeyond the governors' races, mayoral contests in New York, Minneapolis and Seattle will highlight generational and ideological divides in the Democratic Party. Supreme Court elections in Pennsylvania, a key swing state, offer a check on the main parties' strength. Races farther down the ticket -- state legislative showdowns in Mississippi, a close attorney general contest in Virginia, two seats on Georgia's public service commission, even a City Council recall in Mesa, Ariz. -- will offer glimpses at the state of both parties in a time of division and rancor.\n\nIn New York City, the rise of 34-year-old Zohran Mamdani, the democratic socialist who polls show is favored to win the mayor's race, has demonstrated the left's appetite to inject fresh faces and new ideas into the fight. Mr. Mamdani faces a November rematch with former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who is running as an independent after Mr. Mamdani's victory in the Democratic primary.\n\nOther consequential contests include a California ballot measure to redraw the state's congressional lines. The measure could squeeze as many as five House Republicans out of their seats and fortify a half-dozen Democratic incumbents in an effort to offset redistricting gambits by Republicans in Texas, North Carolina, Missouri and potentially more states.\n\nRepublicans hold a three-seat majority in the House headed into the 2026 midterm elections, magnifying the importance of each seat carved off the battleground landscape by partisan mapmakers.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom of California, the architect of the state's proposed new maps, held a bullish final rally in Los Angeles on Saturday, predicting Tuesday would be the beginning of a Democratic comeback.\n\n\"What this is all about is Democrats getting back on our toes -- not our heels -- getting our mojo back,\" Mr. Newsom said at the event, where former Vice President Kamala Harris also appeared. \"I cannot wait for Nov. 5, Nov. 6 and all the punditry.\"\n\nThe body language from top Republicans was far less optimistic. Mr. Trump himself has done little campaigning, including in the final weekend. He has held no big rallies, instead speaking at recent telephone rallies aimed at New Jersey and Virginia voters.\n\nMr. Trump's Justice Department has announced plans to send officials to \"monitor polling sites\" in six California and New Jersey counties, a tactic that Mr. Newsom has called an effort at voter intimidation and suppression -- and even a pretext to later make false claims of fraud.\n\nThe elections are also unfolding against the unusual backdrop of the federal government shutdown, which will rank as the longest in American history by the time the polls close on Tuesday. Mr. Trump and congressional Democrats have barely engaged in negotiations, each side hoping a protracted fight will inflict more damage to the other.\n\nThe fall's most contested and costly race -- with more than $200 million in advertising -- is for New Jersey's governorship. Jack Ciattarelli, the Republican nominee, is making his third run in a row for the seat, after narrowly losing four years ago to Gov. Philip D. Murphy, a Democrat. He is urging voters to \"elect a Jersey guy\" and pressing to replicate Mr. Trump's strong showing in the state's Black and Latino communities.\n\nRepresentative Mikie Sherrill, who is the Democratic nominee and a former Navy pilot, has promised to declare a Day 1 emergency to address rising utility costs in the state and blames Mr. Trump for the high cost of living. Mr. Ciattarelli, in turn, has blamed Mr. Murphy and Democrats who dominate the statehouse for the state's struggles.\n\nTwo historical and countervailing trends are converging in New Jersey.\n\nIf Ms. Sherrill were to win, it would be the first time the state's voters have elected governors from the same party for three consecutive terms since the 1960s. At the same time, the state has often selected a new governor who counterbalances the party that occupies the White House, including both Mr. Murphy during Mr. Trump's first term and Gov. Chris Christie during the first year of Barack Obama's presidency.\n\nThe other top race is in Virginia, where Abigail Spanberger, the former congresswoman and C.I.A. case officer, is favored to win the governor's mansion and replace the outgoing Gov. Glenn Youngkin, a Republican.\n\nThe Republican nominee, Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, has never found her footing in a state that has been disproportionately affected both by the government shutdown and the Trump administration's shedding of federal jobs. Though Mr. Trump never endorsed Ms. Earle-Sears, the Spanberger campaign has barraged the airwaves with ads tying her to the president.\n\nMs. Spanberger and Ms. Sherrill, who were roommates when serving in Congress together, are both moderate Democrats who were first elected in the Democratic wave of 2018, helping the party flip control of the House in Mr. Trump's first term. Some party strategists see their candidacies -- even if they have not inspired the crowds and excitement of Mr. Mamdani's -- as templates for how to take the House again in 2026.\n\nBut Joe Gruters, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, downplayed the significance of the results even if Democrats swept the governors' races on Tuesday.\n\n\"I don't think it has any indication whatsoever on the 2026 midterm because these are both heavily blue states,\" Mr. Gruters said in an interview, praising Mr. Ciattarelli's campaign in particular. \"I think the fact that we're competitive and are running close campaigns is an indication that we're better off -- these are tough states for Republicans.\"\n\nThe entire Virginia House of Delegates is also up for election this year, with the possibility that Ms. Spanberger won't just win the governor's mansion but establish full Democratic control in the state.\n\nVirginia's most intense contest has proved to be the race for attorney general between the incumbent, Jason Miyares, and the Democratic nominee, Jay Jones. The Jones campaign has been consumed by the disclosure of old private text messages in which the candidate wished violence on his political enemies. Mr. Jones has apologized, but the scandal has spilled into the governor's race, dominating Ms. Earle-Sears's recent advertising.\n\nThe race is expected to test the boundaries of ticket-splitting in an era when it has become increasingly rare. Mr. Miyares is expected to depend on winning over Spanberger voters to score re-election.\n\nThroughout 2025, Democrats have celebrated a string of either victories or better-than-expected performances in races in heavily Republican districts. But those were in obscure special elections where extremely few voters turn out. The races on Tuesday offer the party a chance to prove its competitiveness on a bigger canvas.\n\nThe outcomes of low-turnout elections held in so-called off years are far from predictive. Just two years ago, Democrats scored a slate of big victories -- the Kentucky governorship, an abortion-rights measure in Ohio, control of the Virginia Legislature -- only to lose the White House and Senate in 2024.\n\nPredictive or not, any party would far prefer victory over defeat.\n\n\"A win to win, whether it's by one vote or 10 points or 20 points,\" Mr. Martin said.\n\nOne overlooked but potentially consequential set of races is the retention elections for the State Supreme Court in Pennsylvania, where three Democratic justices must win approval to keep their seats -- and thus maintain the party's majority on the court in the nation's premier battleground through the next presidential election.\n\nEugene DePasquale, who became chairman of the Pennsylvania Democratic Party this year, said that success in the judicial contests could help lift the party's spirits after Democrats suffered serious defeats there in 2024.\n\n\"Momentum matters,\" Mr. DePasquale said in an interview. \"We just have to start winning.\"", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/03/us/politics/us-elections-democrats-trump.html"}

Do they focus, instead, on boosting progressive rising stars even as Republicans paint the party as too-radical?\n\nSome less conventional Democrats question whether the party should bother relying on the traditional leadership structure, who may lean too much on outdated tactics, in Washington at all. While other, more traditional members, argue they're not in as much disarray as their critics claim.\n\nDemocrats in Washington point to recent wins as proof that their brand is not as toxic as some critics claim: two Republican legislative district flips in Iowa; electing a Democrat in a Pennsylvania state senate seat for the first time in 130 years; elevating a Democratic mayor to lead Omaha's blue dot, for example.\n\nThey're banking on likely successes in the days-away gubernatorial races in Virginia and New Jersey (and to a lesser extent, dominance in New York City's mayoral race) as reputational defibrillators a year out from the midterms.\n\n\"We have the momentum, certainly, heading into this final stretch,\" Democratic National Committee chairman Ken Martin told ABC News in a recent interview, of anticipated wins in New Jersey, Virginia, and Pennsylvania's supreme court races.\n\nYet a recent ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos poll found that more Americans say the Democratic Party is \"out of touch with the concerns of most people in the United States today\" (68%) than Trump (63%) and the Republican Party (61%).\n\nAsked on Sunday why more Americans feel this way about Democrats than the president -- even amidst the East Wing demolitions or a White House Halloween party hosted during the shutdown -- Martin suggested Republicans were in hotter water and disapproved of by Americans more.\n\nBut pressed on what Democrats are doing to try to get more in touch with voters -- or why he thinks, even if there is a swing away from Trump, people still see the Democrats as out of touch -- Martin said he's confident the party is making strides regardless of what the polls say.\n\n\"I can't speak to that because I've seen a lot of other polls that suggest just the opposite, right? People are starting to put their trust and faith back in with the Democratic Party. And you know, I can tell you right now that you know, we've been out there having conversations with voters, growing our coalition,\" Martin said, adding that Trump's policies and actions are creating an opening for Democrats to have conversations with disillusioned voters.\n\nDemocrats also hope to mine several lessons from their soon-to-be-released election analysis (don't call it a postmortem, members joke).\n\nOne of Martin biggest takeaways from the report, he told ABC News, is that \"everyone just started their campaign way too late, and we had already been defined before we ever had a chance to define ourselves ... we cannot wait to talk to voters until the final few months before an election.\"\n\nYet, some Democrats see their party's lower approval numbers (32%, per a recent Associated Press survey) and believe they should pivot away from the traditional party apparatus.\n\n\"We are a party without a leader, and so there is no one to set the tone,\" a former DNC staffer and Democratic strategist told ABC News.\n\nThey argue that there are vulnerabilities beyond the DNC, but also from more classical candidate recruitment from congressional leadership's political operation, who they suggested are not taking necessary risks on non-traditional picks. Sen. Chuck Schumer is reportedly facing resistance to his leadership among potential Senate candidates.\n\nA second former DNC staffer, who has since worked on presidential campaigns, put it more bluntly: \"The current iteration of the DNC has weakened itself out of relevance and should not be seen as anything but a fundraising vessel.\"\n\nLibby Schneider, deputy executive director of the DNC, concedes that it's typical after an election loss to be heartbroken and upset, and understands there may be some criticism in its wake. Despite that, she argues the committee is laser-focused on winning and wishes to be a tool to help candidates succeed.\n\n\"People can feel what they need to feel and grieve how they need to grieve about this loss, and we will change the things that we need to change in order to continue to perform well. But to me, people complaining tells me that they care a whole lot, and I think that that's valuable. And also, frankly, we can listen to that stuff and still do our jobs every day to elect Democrats,\" said Schneider.\n\n\"We went from being the party of cool with Barack Obama to turning into the party of nerds and dweebs and losers, right? What is really annoying about all of it is that we have winners. We have good stars,\" the second staffer continued. told ABC News.\n\nObama has aligned himself, and whatever residual it-factor he possesses, with marquee political fights over the last few months: rallying Texas Democrats who broke quorum, in-person campaigning for both the Virginia and New Jersey gubernatorial races, boosting Democrats in Pennsylvania's supreme court elections, to cutting ads for Gov. Gavin Newsom's redistricting proposition.\n\nFormer Vice President Kamala Harris is also keeping her options open on her political career, as she publicly doesn't rule out another White House run during her book tour.\n\nThere's no consensus that Harris is the exciting nominee she once was -- though the first former DNC staffer suggests.\n\n\"She shouldn't be sent out to pasture -- she made the most out of an impossible situation for four years. At the same time, if we're serious about telling voters we're moving forward -- she can't be our nominee in 2028. Is she a leading voice in the party, yes? Should she be our main and only voice, absolutely not,\" the first former DNC staffer added.\n\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders has also been criss-crossing the country with rumored '28 candidate Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez drawing substantial crowds, meanwhile, former Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel and Newsom have not shied away from their ambitions, either.\n\nSome Democrats argue that not having one main spokesperson presents an opportunity for the various stars, rising or seasoned, to sparkle.\n\n\"We have to be a tent that wins by addition and not subtraction,\" Schneider said. She feels confident ahead of Tuesday's elections, and believes that there's a strong case to be made to voters about Trump's impact on their bottom line, their health care premiums, their overall cost of living, as well as voters' souring on the president's handling of the economy and immigration.\n\nPer a new ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos poll, roughly 6 in 10 Americans disapprove of Trump's handling of the job.\n\nAnd despite worries of disinterested donors and shrinking voter registration, the campaign arms of the party, taking cues from Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, are outraising their Republican counterparts, even as the national party heavily lags in that arena. The DSCC raised nearly $20 million in Q3, versus the NRSC's $18 million, and the DCCC currently has a slight cash-on-hand edge, with $46.6 million to the NRCC's $45.8. A DNC official says the committee\n\nFormer Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, who rebuilt the DNC as chair after the party's devastating losses in 2001, is bullish on his party's chances to sweep over the next year, as he believes droves of voters will reject Trump due to rising costs, shrinking access to health care, and negative impacts of the government shutdown, and trickle back to Democrats after this off-cycle election day.\n\n\"The Democratic Party is poised to take off like a booster rocket,\" said McAuliffe, who, a few weeks ago, hosted a packed fundraiser for Virginia's Democratic gubernatorial candidate, Abigail Spanberger, at his home alongside the Clintons on behalf of the Democratic Governors' Association.\n\nMcAuliffe said the 400-or-so attendees raised $2.2 million in one night -- proof, he argues, of his party's unquestionable desire to win. His message to hand-wringers and eye-rollers, even some within the party, echoes from what many at the top tell ABC: \"We need to be encouraged, people are counting on us to fight. I'm tired of the whining, complaining, the party of lemon suckers. Get in the game.\"\n\nJaime Harrison, Martin's most recent predecessor at the DNC, realized the extent of his party's vulnerabilities during his 2020 Senate bid to unseat Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham. (Santa Claus could run on Christmas as a Democrat and lose, he jokes.)\n\nHarrison worries about the perceptions of disjointedness, and suggested that various groups like the DGA, members of Congress, and the DNC convene for a joint-policy retreat \"so that people see we're all in alignment on our message, on our mission.\"\n\nHarrison also said he hopes the party seriously considers hosting a midterm convention, which could amplify their talent and hammer home their priorities. Schneider said a potential event is \"in the mix.\"\n\n\"The Democrats are looking for a unity of purpose, a unity of message, a unity of strategy. And it's important that the leadership right now provides that,\" said Harrison, who says he trusts Martin and believes support, from donors and otherwise, will return after Democratic wins on Tuesday.\n\n\"I'm not overly concerned. If we were in June of '26 and we're still not getting major donors, then I'm concerned. But we're not there yet,\" he added, expressing confidence in the continued grassroots support.\n\nSome Democrats also point to Martin's tenure as one that prioritizes infrastructure. For example, state parties now get major influxes of cash, to the tune of a million dollars a month, to hire staff, set up programs, and fortify their ranks. \"Party changing money,\" adds Schneider. Lauren Nechochea, chair of the Idaho Democrats, told ABC News her chapter now has steady, monthly financial support.\n\nTexas Rep. Gene Wu, chair of the Lone Star State House Democratic caucus, said Jefferies and Martin gave his cohort full support to break quorum and attempt to block Republican redistricting efforts, a move that kicked off the party's more aggressive opposition to redistricting nationwide.\n\nWu acknowledges that the perception of the Democratic Party is in peril, and is anxious for politicians to openly fight for the working class. He says voters, friends see Democrats as message-less, scolding hall monitors.\n\n\"People who would rather be right than win; people who would rather spend the time to tell other people how they're wrong instead of telling people what they would do about it and how they're going to fix it,\" Wu told ABC News.\n\nWu said candidates need to be firmer on their beliefs, and his party must run candidates willing to take Republicans to task (like California's Gov. Newsom in his push to draw Democratic friendly maps) or face total failure.\n\n\"I think that the reality of where we are today and what the cost of failure will mean, I don't think people are under any illusion of where we are at this moment,\" said Wu, who added, \"this is not time for us to screw around ... I don't give a crap that you think Democrats are wimpy or whatever else. But if you want America to not suck anymore, you better join us.\"", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/US/democrats-lean-fighter-persona-party-rebuilds-ahead-2026/story?id=126909170"}

(Pete Kiehart/For The Washington Post)\n\nAgencies have hung enormous portraits of President Donald Trump outside their buildings. The Treasury Department is preparing to mint a commemorative coin that shows Trump raising a heroic fist. The president is planning a triumphal arch across from the Lincoln Memorial for America's 250th birthday.\n\nTrump has also added 24-karat golden adornments to the Oval Office, giving it a palatial feel. He has arranged to receive a luxurious Boeing jetliner from Qatar. He has ordered thicker paper, decorated with gold, for the letters he writes to military officers who are becoming generals.\n\nTrump's aggressive moves to accumulate political power -- deploying National Guard troops, invoking massive tariffs -- have prompted protests and lawsuits as well as plaudits. But he is also asserting his power through what might be called an imperial aesthetic: surrounding his presidency with visual cues designed to project personal command and grandeur.\n\n\"What it's intended to convey is a kind of martial strength, the kind of presence of power that you see a lot of dictators around the world wanting to project,\" said Sen. Adam Schiff (D-California). \"The gold ornate style, the imposing portraiture, the military parades, the physical depiction on currency -- this is what you see from state-run authoritarian regimes.\"\n\nMost recently and starkly, construction has begun on a 90,000-square-foot White House ballroom that will be almost as large as the rest of the White House complex, creating a monumental structure that, Trump's supporters hope, will be associated with his presidency long after he has left office.\n\nIn recent days, Trump's aspirations to an imperial aura have become even more literal. When large crowds turned out for a \"No Kings\" protest on Oct. 18, Trump responded with an AI-generated video of himself wearing a crown, piloting a plane with \"King Trump\" inscribed on the side and dumping what appeared to be feces on protesters.\n\nThe penchant for the gold and grand has not been lost on those seeking Trump's favor. South Korean leaders on Wednesday gave the president a replica of a historic golden crown, saying it symbolized peace and unity. Apple CEO Tim Cook in August gifted the president a glass plaque with a 24-karat gold base.\n\nWhite House communications director Steven Cheung said in a statement that Trump's changes will benefit all Americans.\n\n\"This is not an imperial aesthetic, this is an American aesthetic,\" Cheung said.\n\nTevi Troy, a presidential historian who was a senior official in the administration of George W. Bush, said Trump's aesthetic suggests less an aspiration to royalty than a background as a real estate developer.\n\n\"He has a sense of what he thinks American building and American power should look like, and that is reflected in whatever plans he puts forward,\" Troy said. \"I don't think it's necessarily monarchical. It just reflects what he thinks it should look like, which is different from what others think it should look like.\"\n\nOther presidents have also brought their aesthetic tastes to the White House, Troy noted. Richard M. Nixon, influenced by the pageantry he saw in Europe, ordered ornate uniforms for the Secret Service, prompting widespread mockery. Bush, who cherished a cowboy image, had Western paintings hung throughout the building.\n\nYet Trump's changes have been more dramatic and grandiose than those of any president in recent memory. To his critics, they are the physical counterpart of what they see as his un-American grasp for overwhelming power.\n\nThat is especially true of the planned ballroom, for which the East Wing of the White House has now been demolished. California Gov. Gavin Newsom called it a \"knockoff Versailles on White House grounds.\" Schiff said it brings to mind the gaudy palaces of such former dictators as Romania's Nicolae Ceausescu and Iraq's Saddam Hussein.\n\nSome Democrats say the next president should demolish the ballroom, which is proceeding without input from Congress or other government bodies. On Tuesday, Trump fired all six members of the Commission of Fine Arts, an independent agency that had expected to review the ballroom and arch.\n\nSo far the project is not popular: Americans oppose tearing down the East Wing for a ballroom by a 2-to-1 margin (56 percent-28 percent), according to a Washington Post-ABC News-Ipsos poll released Thursday.\n\nThe White House is working to communicate an image of Trump as a historical figure in other ways as well.\n\nBrandon Beach, treasurer of the United States, has confirmed that commemorative $1 coins honoring Trump are being planned for next year. That means Trump \"will forever be the face of America's 250th Birthday,\" conservative commentator Steve Guest posted on X.\n\nThe president's daughter in law, Lara Trump, has proposed that Trump's face grace a new $25 or $45 bill -- or perhaps a $47 bill, in recognition of his role as the 47th president.\n\nCritics say honors in America have been traditionally granted many years after a figure passes from the scene to avoid erecting memorials to figures whom history may judge to be unworthy. Construction on the Washington Monument began in 1848, a half-century after George Washington left office; Abraham Lincoln first appeared on the $5 bill in 1914, almost 50 years after his assassination.\n\n\"I don't think it fits into our traditions to build monument to himself. No president has done in that in history,\" Schiff said. \"It would be the equivalent of Washington building his own Washington Monument. I think if anything, our history is one of preservation of our legacy, of making the White House be the people's house.\"\n\nIn September, Schiff issued a report charging that the administration, by hanging large banners with Trump's image outside government agencies, was illegally engaging in propaganda. To emphasize the point, Schiff's office appended photos of the large banners hung by such dictators as Joseph Stalin and Benito Mussolini.\n\nTrump's supporters say the president is not naming such projects as the ballroom after himself, and that they will benefit the country for years to come. \"It's going to be a permanent renovation that will enhance the White House for all future presidents,\" Rep. Steve Scalise (R-Louisiana) told reporters.\n\nBut critics say that unilaterally imposing his own over-the-top vision on the landscape is Trump's way of proclaiming his own grandeur, not the country's. On Friday, Trump unveiled pictures of the White House's Lincoln Bathroom redone with white marble and gold fixtures, in sharp contrast to the bedroom itself.\n\n\"Trump has long treated all forms of architecture as tools of personal identity,\" said Debbie Millman, who chairs the masters in branding program at the School of Visual Arts in New York. \"Trump will call it the Trump ballroom, because it is already an extension of the Trump equity. This enduring building will be reshaped in the image of Trump's brand.\"\n\nTrump denied reports that he was considering naming the ballroom after himself as \"fake news,\" suggesting the Presidential Ballroom as one name possibility.\n\nDavid Harrison, who chairs the French Department at Grinnell College and is an expert in French history, said Trump's aesthetic has always owed a good deal to the palace at Versailles, which came to symbolize the excesses of the French monarchy.\n\n\"From Donald Trump's first forays into personal architecture, there is a clear throughline that Versailles, and particularly the Hall of Mirrors, is the model of power and authority,\" Harrison said. \"It seems to represent an aesthetic of personal glory, of authority, of luxury.\"\n\nBeyond the decorative, the Trump administration has regularly engineered scenes designed to portray him as a global colossus.\n\nCabinet meetings have become venues for officials to deliver a nonstop flow of compliments. He personally reviewed a military parade, a rarity for a U.S. president, on June 14 -- a day that was both the U.S. Army's birthday and his own, inspired by French commemorations of Bastille Day.\n\nHis aides' public praise is strikingly florid. \"Let me just say, Mr. President, that this country was going to die without you,\" Stephen Miller, the deputy White House chief of staff, told the president at an Oct. 23 event. \"This country was going to actually die without you. ... You alone saved it.\"\n\nTroy said unilateralism is at the heart of Trump's presidency, and reshaping the physical environment is part of that.\n\n\"I've had this theory that Trump does not have an ideology so much as a methodology, and that methodology is unilateralism,\" Troy said. \"He learned in his first term that the courts and the legislature can stand in his way. In his second term, he is emphasizing things like pardons, tariffs, executive order -- and reordering the White House.\"\n\nTrump's clearest predecessor when it comes to White House redesign may be President Chester A. Arthur, who hired Louis Comfort Tiffany, the most famed designer of his day, to give the White House a sweeping -- some would say gaudy -- makeover in the early 1880s.\n\nStill, Arthur was reacting to a White House that had become shabby and run-down over the years, not remaking an already stately mansion as Trump is doing.\n\nHistorically, Harrison said, structures that are built as witnesses to a ruler's power often fade or crumble with time, coming to represent instead the futility of excessive ambition.\n\n\"Construction can be intended to project authority, dignity, glory and a desire for immortality,\" Harrison said. \"But the reality is that many of things we think of as being done for that reason later come to represent the exact opposite -- the vanity and the ephemerality of human wishes.\"", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/11/03/trump-gold-luxury-imperial-ballroom/"}

Gavin Newsom signed last month, creating an Office of Civil Rights to help schools identify and prevent antisemitism. State lawmakers approved the legislation as political tensions have flared in the U.S. over Israel's war in Gaza.\n\nThe new law, which takes effect Jan. 1, does not define antisemitism but gives educators the impression that they could be charged with discrimination \"if they expose their students to ideas, information, and instructional materials that may be considered critical of the State of Israel and the philosophy of Zionism,\" according to the complaint.\n\nJenin Younes, national legal director at the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, says the lack of guidance has a chilling effect on speech among educators.\n\n\"They censor themselves very broadly because they don't know what's going to get them into trouble,\" she said.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed on behalf of individual teachers and students in California public schools, and the Los Angeles Educators for Justice in Palestine.\n\nIn the complaint, middle school science teacher Jonah Olson, says students at his rural, largely Christian school district, often ask him what it means to be Jewish. He responds in part by saying that his Judaism does not include support for the State of Israel, and now he fears that might violate the law.\n\nParents who are part of the lawsuit say they fear their children will be prevented from learning about differing perspectives on Israel, Palestine and the Middle East.\n\nStudents in public schools nationwide are generally protected against discrimination through state, federal and district policies, but supporters of the law say they needed to do more given a surge in harassment and bullying of Jewish and Israeli students.\n\nThe Anti-Defamation League, which supports the new law, said 860 antisemitic acts such as harassment, vandalism and assault were reported to the group last year at non-Jewish K-12 schools nationwide.

Hundreds of thousands of federal workers have missed paychecks, and major airports are grappling with flight delays and cancellations due to staffing shortages.\n\nPresident Trump and Republicans have pinned the blame on Senate Democrats, who are filibustering a House-passed stopgap bill to fund the government through Nov. 21.\n\nDemocrats are demanding an extension of enhanced Obamacare premium subsidies that help people afford health insurance and are set to expire at the end of the year.\n\nSEE ALSO: Democrats accuse Trump admin, GOP of weaponizing hunger amid legal battle over SNAP benefits\n\nThey also want a reversal of the future Medicaid spending cuts included in Mr. Trump's \"Big, Beautiful\" bill.\n\nPressure on Democrats intensified last week when the American Federation of Government Employees -- representing hundreds of thousands of unpaid federal workers -- endorsed the Republican funding measure.\n\nMeanwhile, the legal battle over SNAP escalated after 25 states and the District of Columbia sued the administration, arguing it could tap into contingency funds to keep the program running.\n\nThe Department of Agriculture planned to freeze payments from funds needed to cover the cost of the food program starting Nov. 1, saying it could no longer continue funding it due to the shutdown.\n\nThen on Friday, two federal judges simultaneously ordered the administration to make the payments with contingency funds.\n\nU.S District Judge John J. McConnell in Rhode Island gave the administration until Monday to detail its plan for funding SNAP.\n\n\"There is no question that the congressionally approved contingency funds must be used now because of the shutdown,\" Judge McConnell wrote in his order.\n\nMr. Trump said he would provide the money, but wanted more clarity from the court.\n\n\"It will be my honor to provide the funding, just like I did with military and law enforcement pay,\" Mr. Trump said on Truth Social.\n\nOn Sunday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that the \"courts keep jamming up things,\" reiterating that Mr. Trump \"wants to make sure that people get their food benefits.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries accused Mr. Trump of \"weaponizing hunger.\"\n\n\"It's very unfortunate that Donald Trump and Republicans have decided to weaponize hunger and withhold SNAP benefits,\" Mr. Jeffries, New York Democrat, said on CNN's State of the Union.\n\nMeanwhile, the public could be souring on Mr. Trump and Republicans.\n\nAn NBC News survey found that 52% of voters blame Mr. Trump and Republicans for the shutdown, compared to 42% who fault Democrats. A Washington Post-ABC News-Ipsos poll showed similar results, with 45% blaming Republicans and 33% blaming Democrats.\n\nPlus, nearly six in ten voters disapproved of the president's overall job performance, including his handling of the economy, tariffs, and overall management of the government.\n\nThe political fallout could be felt in Tuesday's gubernatorial elections in Virginia and New Jersey -- off-year contests often seen as early indicators of national sentiment, though they frequently go against the party that holds the White House, especially in Virginia.\n\nDemocrats lead in both races and hope to rebound after a disappointing 2024 election cycle.\n\nVoters in California are also weighing in on a new set of congressional maps, backed by Gov. Gavin Newsom and state Democrats.\n\nThe maps are intended to create more Democratic-friendly districts and bypass the state's nonpartisan commission, which was set up exactly to avoid partisan gerrymandering.\n\nThe map is California Democrats' answer to the Trump-inspired redistricting efforts in Republican-led states that aim to give the GOP a better shot at holding onto its slim House majority in next year's midterms.\n\nDuring an appearance on NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" Mr. Newsom predicted a big night for Democrats.\n\n\"This is a historically unpopular president,\" Mr. Newsom said. \"His policies are even more unpopular than the president himself.\"\n\nHe added, \"In every core category, he's underwater.\"\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson painted a different picture on \"Fox News Sunday.\"\n\nDismissing the idea that the public is turning on Republicans, Mr. Johnson cited a recent CNN survey that found the GOP brand has improved in voters' eyes during the shutdown.\n\n\"This is not about winning a political contest here.

Over the past 10 years, New York has lost approximately 2 million residents; New Jersey and Illinois have each lost around 500,000. About 2 million refugees have fled the Golden State in the past 15 years. On the other side of the coin are Texas and Florida, each of which has gained nearly 2 million residents in recent years.\n\nPolitical people, being the narrow, small-minded people that we are, instantly gravitate to explanations that the flight from blue states to red states is all or mostly about state governmental policy, especially taxes. In other words, the citizenry is sorting itself out based on political preferences.\n\nSecond, and in a very much related development, Republicans in a handful of states -- Texas being the most prominent -- have decided that they want to maximize the number of congressional districts they control by redrawing the lines that demarcate those districts. Not surprisingly, Democrats have joined this electoral arms race, most energetically in California.\n\nWhen elected officials get to pick their voters, the value and purpose of elections are minimized and the value of incumbency is maximized. Gerrymandering inevitably results in a system where adherence to partisan norms, rather than representing voters' interests, becomes the most critical focus and goal of the elected official.\n\nGerrymandering leads to anti-democratic results. The California House delegation consists of 43 Democrats and nine Republicans. Gov. Gavin Newsom has indicated that he can reduce the number of Republicans in the delegation to just four, making the new split 48-4. In the most recent elections in California, about 60% of voters voted for Democratic candidates in House races and about 40% voted for Republican candidates. If you just split the delegation along those lines, it would have about 38 Democrats and 21 Republicans.\n\nIn Illinois, the House delegation consists of 14 Democrats and three Republicans despite the fact that in 2024, about 47% of Illinois voters voted for Republican House candidates. That delegation should have nine Democrats and eight Republicans.\n\nIt is not just the Democrats. Missouri's House delegation is 75% Republican. In 2024, 58% of Missouri voters voted for Republicans. If the proposed map in Texas is adopted, Republicans would hold about 80% of the House seats from Texas, despite winning only 58% of the vote. In Florida, about 70% of the House delegation is Republican; again, only 58% of the voters voted for Republican House candidates in 2024.\n\nIn short, and most relevant to this moment, gerrymandering exacerbates our political divisions by essentially disenfranchising political minorities. If voters aren't represented through the political process, they will eventually find other outlets for their concerns.\n\nFinally, in my neighborhood in suburban Richmond, Virginia, there are more than a few yard signs that encourage people to vote for Jay Jones for attorney general. Mr. Jones' principal claim to fame is that he spoke openly and enthusiastically about killing the speaker of the Virginia House of Delegates, as well as the man's children. Despite that, among the well-off and exceedingly polite people of Chesterfield County, there are obviously more than a handful who are OK with assassinations and who advertise their support for a would-be assassin for political office.\n\nAll three of these features of our current political landscape -- people choosing where to live based on politics, gerrymandering so thorough that it essentially precludes participation in the political process by those who are part of the minority party in a particular state, and (especially egregious and worrisome) a willingness of some voters to support murderous violence against their enemies -- conspire to make national political dissolution appear to be a very real possibility.\n\nThe first two make it much more likely that states will become redder or bluer, thereby maximizing the potential for irreconcilable conflicts. The third one makes political violence much more likely.\n\nIn 1859, as he headed toward the gallows after his failed effort to seize the federal armory at Harpers Ferry, Virginia, and ignite a slave rebellion, John Brown, the prophet of the apocalypse that was coming, gave the hangman a note. It read, in part: \"I, John Brown, am now quite certain that the crimes of this guilty land will never be purged away, but with blood.\"\n\nHe was, of course, correct.", "url": "https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2025/nov/2/gerrymandering-migration-political-violence-set-stage-americas-great/"}

A special edition of \"THIS WEEK\" starts right now.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): The money's there. And Trump has said, don't spend a dime.\n\nDONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: But all the Democrats have to do is say, let's go. I mean, you know, they don't have to do anything.\n\nRADDATZ: Federal programs start running dry as the month-long shutdown hits home.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We are one of the wealthiest countries in the world, yet we're willing to let people go hungry.\n\nRADDATZ: The impacts of the spending freeze cascading into American life.\n\nTRANSPORTATION SECRETARY SEAN DUFFY: Our traffic will be snarled. But it will be a disaster in aviation.\n\nRADDATZ: As voters in several states prepare for the first major elections since President Trump's return to the White House.\n\nWINSOME EARLE-SEARS (R), VIRGINIA GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE: As we all know, this race, the world is watching!\n\nABIGAIL SPANBERGER (D), VIRGINIA GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE: The results on Tuesday will be a reflection of what it is that we are for.\n\nRADDATZ: We visit New Jersey, a blue stronghold that saw one of the hardest shifts to the right in 2024.\n\nJACK CIATTARELLI (R), NEW JERSEY GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE: The closeness in my race and the closeness in the president's race last year were real eye-openers.\n\nMIKIE SHERRILL (D), NEW JERSEY GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE: I'm going to take on Donald Trump when it comes to our economy here in New Jersey.\n\nRADDATZ: This morning, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy and Democratic Senator Tim Kaine join us. We break down the latest results from our brand-new poll, two days before Election Day. And analysis from our powerhouse roundtable.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nANNOUNCER: This is a special edition of \"THIS WEEK,\" \"Your Voice, Your Vote 2025.\" Here now, Martha Raddatz.\n\nRADDATZ: Good morning and welcome to \"THIS WEEK.\"\n\nWe are just two days away from key election in several states across the country. Elections that will give us a sense of the nation's mood and potentially an early signal of what could come next in 2026 as Democrats seek to regain power in Washington after Trump's tumultuous return to office.\n\nAnd our new ABC News/\"Washington Post\"/Ipsos poll out this morning finds that the mood of the country is decidedly negative, with two-thirds of Americans saying the country is on the wrong track under President Trump. But that is an improvement from this same time last year under President Biden.\n\nThe economy is a major part of the current discontent, with more than six in ten Americans disapproving of how President Trump is handling the economy, as well as tariffs. And a similar share blaming him for the current rate of inflation. Overall, a majority of Americans disapproved of the president's handling of every issue we polled.\n\nAs for the Democrats, more Americans say the Democratic Party is out of touch with the concerns of most people in the U.S. today, than say the same about Trump and the Republican Party.\n\nAll of this comes as more Americans are starting to feel the fallout from the now month long government shutdown, which seems to have no end in sight.\n\nAnd that's where we start this morning with ABC's Jay O'Brien.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\nJAY O'BRIEN, ABC NEWS CORRESPONDENT (voice over): The government shutdown now on the brink of becoming the longest in U.S. history.\n\nMINORITY LEADER SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER: Republicans are living in fantasy, pretending as if the issue will fix itself.\n\nSPEAKER OF THE HOUSE REP. MIKE JOHNSON: The blame for this lies 100 percent with the senators sitting over there on the Democrat Party.\n\nO'BRIEN (voice over): But Americans seem to be more critical of the GOP. ABC's new poll with \"THE WASHINGTON POST\" and Ipsos finds 45 percent of Americans blame President Donald Trump and Republicans for the shutdown, while 33 percent say the same about Democrats.\n\nNo matter who is to blame, the pain is getting worse by the day. On Saturday, funding for SNAP federal food assistance drying up. The benefits halted for 42 million Americans.\n\nSYMONE WILKES, SNAP RECIPIENT: I'm already struggling.\n\nO'BRIEN (voice over): Simone Wilkes, a single working mother from Detroit, has two young boys and relies on SNAP. She's now looking at taking a second job.\n\nWILKES: It has been days where the kids will eat, and I'll just survive off water.\n\nO'BRIEN (voice over): The Trump administration reversing an earlier plan to use the Department of Agriculture's emergency funds to cover the program during a shutdown.\n\nBROOKE ROLLINS, AGRICULTURE SECRETARY: It is a contingency fund that can only flow if the underlying appropriation is approved.\n\nO'BRIEN (voice over): But on Friday, a federal judge ordering the administration must continue funding SNAP during the shutdown. President Trump responding, writing, he's instructed government lawyers to \"ask the court to clarify how we can legally fund SNAP as soon as possible.\"\n\nBut this worsening food crisis now on a collision course with the issue Democrats are holding firm to fix in this shutdown, looming, skyrocketing health care costs for some 20 million Americans insured through the Affordable Care Act. And with tax credits set to expire, enrollees, on average, set to see their premiums more than double.\n\nSTACY COX, ACA MARKETPLACE ENROLLEE: It's devastating. Just that bill right there, that's more than our mortgage, our insurance, most of our food.\n\nO'BRIEN (voice over): A month into this shutdown, more than 1.4 million federal workers are going without pay, including air traffic controllers. And this week, airports across the country reporting more of those tasked with keeping the skies safe are calling out sick, leading to staffing shortages and delayed flights, expected to only get worse.\n\nPETE LEFEVRE, AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLER: The prospect of going another pay period without pay is weighing on the minds of myself and all the people that I work with.\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\nO'BRIEN (on camera): And, Martha, several governors have now declared a state of emergency, trying to meet this surge in demand now that SNAP has been halted.\n\nMeantime, there's no end to this shutdown in sight. Democrats continue to withhold their votes on government funding, trying to compel Republicans to negotiate with them on health care. Republicans have said they won't do that while the government is shut down.\n\nMartha.\n\nRADDATZ: And for more on the impacts from this shutdown, including on air travel, I'm joined now by Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy.\n\nWe're so pleased to have you here this morning, Mr. Secretary.\n\nAmericans have experienced major delay. There's a ground stop this morning at Newark, all because air traffic controllers are calling in sick. The FAA is saying that \"currently, nearly 50 percent of major air traffic control facilities are experienced staffing shortages, and nearly 80 percent of air traffic controllers are out at New York-area facilities.\"\n\nWe know that safety is your greatest concern, but at some point, might you have to shut down portions of the U.S. airspace, maybe even airports? What point are we at, at that possibility?\n\nTRANSPORTATION SECRETARY SEAN DUFFY: Well, so, first off, I've been traveling around talking to air traffic controllers and there really is frustration. The fact that there's a shutdown right now. The Democrats are focusing on illegal healthcare, and, you know, we've endangered the SNAP beneficiaries, and they don't get paid as air traffic controllers. There's a burning frustration like in the rest of the country.\n\nAnd so, you mentioned that safety is my top priority. And it is. We will delay, we will cancel any kind of flight across the national airspace to make sure people are safe.\n\nBut there is a level of risk that gets injected into the system when we have a controller that's doing two jobs instead of one. We manage that. We look out for it. And safety is the priority.\n\nWe'll take all steps necessary, though, to make sure that you get from point A to point B and you do it safely.\n\nRADDATZ: And just again, how close are we to this point where you might have to close airspace or airports as we watch air traffic controllers calling in sick?\n\nDUFFY: Well, so, first off, if you look at other shutdowns, our air traffic controllers, God bless them, they've been coming to work. They're frustrated, but by and large, they've come. They're not getting paid.\n\nAnd so, I can't predict, Martha, what's going to happen in the future. But as each day goes on, and again, it's not -- you miss a paycheck, but every day you have expenses, food and gas, and then bills come in. Whether it's Netflix or, you know, your YouTube TV, the expenses continue to roll, and the pressure continues to grow.\n\nAnd the problem is, these controllers, a lot of them are new controllers or they're trainee controllers. They don't make a lot of money. And so, they may be the only person that is bringing money into the household. They have to make a decision, do I go to work and not get a paycheck and not put food on the table, or do I drive for Uber or DoorDash or wait tables? Those are the real thoughts and conversations these controllers are having.\n\nSo, as I look forward, I hope Democrats are going to come to their senses and open the government back up. But I would just tell you, as bad as it is, the numbers you just gave, this -- we will look back if -- if the government doesn't open in the next week or two, we'll look back as these were the good days, not the bad days. It's only going to get worse.\n\nAnd, Martha, just one other point on our controllers. We -- as I think you've reported, we have really old, antiquated air traffic control equipment. We have the most efficient and safe airspace, not because of the equipment, but because the great men and women who control the airspace, and we should treat them like the professionals that they are and pay them.\n\nRADDATZ: Well -- well, let's talk about that. The Trump administration this week paid service members by using $2.5 billion in housing funds from the so-called big, beautiful bill. Why haven't you done something similar with air traffic controllers?\n\nDUFFY: Yes, so we've looked throughout our -- our funding mechanisms to see how we could pull money in and -- and pay our controllers. We kept essential air service operational. We're paying our academy students at Oklahoma City. They get a stipend as they go through the academy.\n\nWe're pulling in whatever dollar we can, but there -- there's real restrictions. When you don't fund the government, when you say there's no dollars available, it becomes really challenging to find dollars to pay the different components of really critical workforces that keep our country moving forward.\n\nAnd again, it's simple. Democrats, open up the government, negotiate a deal, have a conversation, introduce a bill, debate it, vote on it, but shutting the government down is not the pathway forward, I think, to make sure you get your way and you get your will.\n\nRADDATZ: And, Mr. Secretary, I want to read from our poll. ABC's new poll with \"The Washington Post\" and Ipsos finds 44 percent of Americans blame Donald Trump and the Republicans for the shutdown, while 33 percent say the same about Democrats.\n\nSo, people are looking at this because the Republicans obviously have both houses of Congress and the White House and putting the blame on Republicans. So, what should Republicans be doing?\n\nDUFFY: Well, I think it's important to say in September, we -- Republicans said we should have the same funding levels in September as we do in October. We didn't change anything.\n\nAgain, you don't use shutdowns to pass bills. You don't hold the American people hostage. You don't hurt the American people to get leverage. And that's exactly what Democrats are doing right now because people are getting hurt.\n\nAnd again, whether you're traveling home to see your family or go to a funeral or a wedding or you're on a business trip, the hours that people are spending in airports, Democrats see that as leverage. And, this not the -- this is not the pathway to get your way or get your will.\n\nAnd I would just note, Martha, Donald Trump had a historic election. He won the popular vote. He won the seven swing states. Democrats roundly lost.\n\nAnd so now to say, \"I'm going to shut down the government to get my way, my will,\" I -- listen, you can't cave to that. Otherwise, you're going to have a shutdown every -- every third month.\n\nAnd so again, the polling is one thing, but the process is another.\n\nRADDATZ: And let's talk about the process and President Trump's role. Demo -- you say Democrats have to come to the table. Republicans have not been negotiating. And Scott Bessent told me just a week ago he think -- he thinks it would be a waste of time for Donald Trump to hold another meeting.\n\nBack in 2011, when Donald Trump was considering a run for president, this is what he said about Barack Obama as a shutdown loomed. Let's listen.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP, 2011)\n\nINTERVIEWER: So, how would you do it now? Now, you're in the Oval Office right now --\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nDONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I would get everybody together and we'd have a budget --\n\nINTERVIEWER: They've all gotten together.\n\nTRUMP: Well, that's because they don't have the right leader. You don't have the right leader. This is the president of the United States has to get this done.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nRADDATZ: And he went on to say, \"The president is the one that has to get people together, and it would be a tremendously negative mark on the president if they couldn't get it done.\" What's your reaction to that?\n\nDUFFY: Well, I'll just tell you that Barack Obama said, \"I'm not going to be blackmailed. I'm not going to be held hostage. This is not the way you negotiate a deal. You lost the election, Republicans,\" that's what Barack Obama said. \"Go through the process.\"\n\nAnd I think that's the right philosophy right now. And again --\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRADDATZ: Should President Trump -- given what he said, should President Trump be meeting? Would you like to see him hold another meeting?\n\nDUFFY: So, here -- here's the problem -- Donald Trump has nothing to negotiate with. We passed a clean funding bill, right? So, what do you negotiate with when you -- again money in September, same as October.\n\nDemocrats are trying to use this as leverage and again trying to change legislation that they don't like. But again, the changes they want to make want to fund healthcare for illegal migrants. That doesn't make sense to Republicans.\n\nIf you want to have a conversation, let's have it. The healthcare funding doesn't end until the end of the year. So why are you shutting the government down in October when you could have a conversation for three months until the end of the year?\n\nI think this doesn't make any sense. I think Democrats are angry. They're playing to the left-wing side of their base. Most commonsense Democrats, I think, would say, \"Open it up and negotiate, pass bills, debate it.\"\n\nBut this is not the approach on how you pass legislation.\n\nRADDATZ: Okay, thanks so much for joining us, and we'll let Tim Kaine respond to what you just said. Thanks so much.\n\nDUFFY: Thanks, Martha.\n\nRADDATZ: And I'm joined now by Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia.\n\nGood morning, Senator.\n\nI know you heard Secretary Duffy there talking about the onus is on the Democrats, and that you are fighting to get legal health care for immigrants.\n\nSEN. TIM KAINE, (D) VIRGINIA: Well, I just got to say, Martha, that's a lie. The healthcare battle is not about healthcare for illegal immigrants, and Sean Duffy knows it. It's about millions of Americans who, in the last few weeks, have gotten premium increase notices that tell them that Donald Trump's Big, Beautiful Bill is delivering them big, ugly health insurance bills within the next few weeks unless we can find a fix.\n\nAnd so, what we're taking for is, let's find a path to a fix and let's also have President Trump finally engage in the negotiation and guarantee that a deal is a deal. If we shake hands on a deal for 30 days or for three months, he won't immediately start firing more people, clawing back economic development projects, going after blue states or blue cities, and allowing funds to be used in red cities.\n\nSo, look, we're looking for a path to fix people's health care costs, and we're looking for the president to agree that a deal is a deal. Thus far he's refused to engage, and we avoid shutdowns or get it out -- get out of shutdowns all the time when the president engages.\n\nRADDATZ: So -- so, Senator, it has been 33 days. Democrats chose not to support that short term CR, which would have kept the government open. You could have negotiated. Now there's some pretty devastating impacts on -- on people looking at -- for SNAP, on air traffic controllers, on air travel. So, what have the Democrats gained from this?\n\nKAINE: Well, I don't look at this as politics. I mean the president told the House, do a budget and, in his words, don't deal with Democrats. So, Senate Democrats put an alternative on the table 12 days before September 30 that fixed the health care wreckage that the Republicans caused and that ensured that a deal would be honored, both by Congress and the White House. The president refused to meet until the day before the deadline. He had Democrats in the Oval Office. And as soon as they walked out, he put up an A.I.-generated video of them wearing sombreros and talking in A.I.-generated fake voices saying they didn't say. The guy's unserious. He's willing to give $20 billion --\n\nRADDATZ: But -- but serious --\n\nKAINE: Hold on. He's been willing to give $20 billion to the Argentinians and meet with them, wreck the White House, have a Great Gatsby party down at Mar-a-Lago. He has not done what he said needed to be done in 2011, sit down with Democratic leadership. If he (INAUDIBLE) --\n\nRADDATZ: Senator, I just want to go back to the --\n\nKAINE: Leadership, this thing (ph) will be resolved in a matter of hours.\n\nRADDATZ: OK. Excuse me. I just want to go back to what Democrats have gotten during this period. Not talking about politics. What have Democrats gained during this period? And how long can this last?\n\nKAINE: I -- you know, Martha, I'm a United States Senator. And I -- yes, I run as a Democrat, and I'm a Democrat, but I just don't approach my work that way. So, when you ask what Democrats have gained, what we're -- what we're focused on is the American people. We want President Trump to stop firing people, canceling economic development projects. We want them to stop raising everybody's costs. You know, health care costs, energy costs, housing costs. Halloween's more expensive. Thanksgiving is more expensive. The holidays are going to be more expensive.\n\nSo, we're asking the president to simply sit down and do what all presidents do. We can find a budget deal that puts us on a path to a health care fix. I don't need all the i's dotted and t's crossed. I just want to be on a path so that people's bills don't spike, and I want the president to agree, stop the wrecking ball. Stop the mass firings and the cancellations of projects you don't like.\n\nAnd I think Americans understand that. And that's why they look at Donald Trump's lack of engagement and overwhelmingly say that he's really more to blame for this.\n\nRADDATZ: We just have a couple of minutes here, but you recently said things are coming together. There are reportedly conversations among rank-and-file senators to try to reach -- to negotiate the reopening of the government for a few weeks. Is that going on right now? Are you part of those discussions?\n\nKAINE: I would say, Martha, I'm sort of at the edge of them. There is a group of people talking about these two issues, a path to fix the health care debacle and a guarantee that if we reopen government, I'm calling it a moratorium on mischief. If we agree to reopen, President Trump's got to stop the firings.\n\nThe FAA, we're talking air traffic control, they've forced 2,400 people out of the FAA during Trump's first year, when they were already short 3,000 air traffic controllers. Stop the firings, stop the games playing, stop going after blue cities and helping red cities. Let's have a moratorium on mischief during whatever this period is. Get on a path to fix people's health care. If the president engages, we will be -- we will find a deal, I think, within hours.\n\nRADDATZ: And, Senator, just quickly, if you can, you're there in Virginia. Virginia holds key elections on Tuesday. Are you confident the Democrats can sweep this?\n\nKAINE: I feel really good about it, Martha. And here's why. In Virginia, we are the best red to blue turnaround in the country in the last 25 years. And the way we've done it is by focusing on the economy. Abigail Spanberger, our candidate, three pillars to her campaign, affordability, jobs, and education, which is about kids, but also about our workforce. Her opponent is running ads on offbeat cultural issues that don't really matter to the most people. In Virginia, Democrats focus on the economy, winning the economic argument, delivering economic results. And that's why the state has moved from red to blue so dramatically since 2000.\n\nRADDATZ: OK. Thanks so much. Good to see you this morning, Senator. Appreciate your time.\n\nKAINE: Thanks, Martha. Good to be with you.\n\nRADDATZ: Up next, our report from New Jersey, looking at what's driving voters there ahead of Tuesday's critical elections. Plus, Rick Klein breaks down the races from New York City to Virginia to California. We're back in two minutes.\n\nBARACK OBAMA, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: We need leaders who will tell the truth and who will take responsibility and tackle hard problems and bring people together instead of tearing them apart. We need leaders who won't serve bosses in Washington or big corporate donors, but instead will serve the people who put them there.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nRADDATZ: Former President Barack Obama hitting the campaign trail this weekend in Virginia and New Jersey. Tuesday's elections in several states will be a critical test of where the country stands one year after returning Donald Trump to the White House, and a potential signal on whether Democrats have a chance to re-take Congress one year from now. So ahead of Tuesday's final voting, we look at how both sides are making their closing arguments to voters.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\nABIGAIL SPANBERGER (D), VIRGINIA GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE: Virginia, are you fired up?\n\nRADDATZ (voice-over): From the high-stakes gubernatorial races in Virginia and New Jersey, to the contentious mayor's race in New York City, and California's consequential redistricting measure that Governor Gavin Newsom is counting on --\n\nGOV. GAVIN NEWSOM (D), CALIFORNIA: We're going to meet the moment not just with rhetoric, but through action.\n\nRADDATZ (voice-over): For Democrats, this will be their first try at redemption since President Donald Trump's re-election.\n\nIn Virginia, moderate Democrat Abigail Spanberger, a former CIA officer and congresswoman, has maintained a modest lead over Republican nominee, Winsome Earle-Sears, the state's current lieutenant governor.\n\nZOHRAN MAMDANI (D), NEW YORK CITY MAYORAL CANDIDATE: New York is not for sale.\n\nRADDATZ (voice-over): And in New York, progressive Zohran Mamdani holds a substantial lead over his opponent including former governor Andrew Cuomo running as an independent. But it is New Jersey that could hold the biggest challenge for Democrats, where moderate congresswoman and former Navy helicopter pilot, Mikie Sherrill's lead is anything but certain.\n\nWe met up with her in Asbury Park between campaign events, where her message is clear.\n\nREP. MIKIE SHERRILL (D), NEW JERSEY GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE: I'm going to fight incredibly hard for families, for kids to get costs down, and I'm going to take on Donald Trump when it comes to our economy here in New Jersey.\n\nRADDATZ (voice-over): But the historically blue state has moved to the right in recent years. Former vice president Kamala Harris won New Jersey by just six points last November, down 10 points from former President Joe Biden's lead in 2020.\n\nRADDATZ: What happened in New Jersey for that right turn in 2024 (ph)?\n\nSHERRILL: I think New Jersey is really representative of what's going on in America. We have a lot of middle class voters who are looking at their costs go up year after year after year, and who felt as if nobody was hearing them. And so, they decided to take a chance on a Trump administration because Trump promised to lower their cost.\n\nUnfortunately, he has done anything but. We've seen costs skyrocket here.\n\nRADDATZ (voice-over): Republican nominee and former assemblyman, Jack Ciattarelli, came close to the governor's mansion last election, losing to Governor Phil Murphy by just three points.\n\nJACK CIATTARELLI, (R) NEW JERSEY GUBERNATORIAL NOMINEE: This is very different from 2021. I'm not running against an incumbent and there's a lot less indifference this time around, not only inside New Jersey, but around the country. The closeness of my race and the closeness of the president's race last year were real eye openers.\n\nRADDATZ (voice-over): The Trump administration's decision to withhold congressionally approved funds for the Gateway Tunnel Project, connecting New York to New Jersey, has faced major blowback.\n\nCIATTARELLLI: He's playing hard ball negotiation tactics with a very uncooperative Democratic Party. By the way, my opponent, if she feels that seriously about the Gateway Project, then vote yes and reopen up the government.\n\nRADDATZ (voice-over): Down in Pennsville Township, we met Bishop Kendon Gibson, a former Democrat-turned-independent who voted for Trump in 2024 because of the economy.\n\nBISHOP KENDON GIBSON, NEW JERSEY VOTER: I voted for policy, change, lowering taxes.\n\nRADDATZ (voice-over): But this election, he's voting blue.\n\nGIBSON: I think that Mikie Sherrill is more for the people, the working people. I think that the Democrats deserve another chance.\n\nRADDATZ (voice-over): When you look at the progressive side of the Democratic Party and the moderate side, what do you wish the Democrats would do?\n\nGIBSON: I think we could have gotten more aggressive with healthcare because now we're stuck with a shutdown and we have to use that as leverage when we could have, you know, really protected Obamacare.\n\nRADDATZ (voice-over): Not all New Jersey voters we spoke to felt the shutdown mattered in this race.\n\nKELSEY ANTHONY, NEW JERSEY VOTER: I think people's minds are sort of made up. Either you think it's a Republican's fault or you think it's a Democrat's fault.\n\nRADDATZ (voice-over): Born and raised in New Jersey, lawyer and Ciattarelli campaign volunteer Kelsey Anthony already cast her ballot.\n\nANTHONY: I am a mom. I have two young children, and I believe that the public education system, specifically funding of the public education system, is broken in New Jersey. The school funding has been completely disproportionate around the state. And Jack has stated that he's going to fix that.\n\nRADDATZ (voice-over): And she knows this race is close.\n\nANTHONY: Generally, New Jersey has many more Democrats than it does Republicans, but I think that right now, the state of the state is not good. And I think that the last eight years have been really telling. And the current administration has really done a number on a lot of New Jersey families. And I think that if there was ever a time for change, it's going to be now.\n\nRADDATZ (voice-over): Over in Princeton, New Jersey, Democrat Chris Johnson voted early for Sherrill but isn't very excited about her candidacy.\n\nCHRIS JOHNSON, NEW JERSEY VOTER: There really was only one option, which is to vote for the Democratic Party. But to be honest, it feels to me a little bit like picking the least worst option. And the fact that we did put so much effort into canvassing and getting the word out and making the phone calls and it was that close in the presidential election and then even in the prior gubernatorial election is worrisome. You know, I think New Jersey is much more purple than people realize.\n\nRADDATZ (voice-over): He says Democrats need to focus less on Trump.\n\nJOHNSON: There's been far too much of an emphasis on continuing to run against Trump and not focusing on what they are going to do with their own messaging, their own platform to improve the lives of people. You know, I think running an ad saying, \"Hey, I'm a mom and I'm a helicopter pilot, so therefore vote for me\", that's not a winning message.\n\nBut we want to drill down a little deeper right now. Our Washington Bureau chief Rick Klein is here now with the breakdown of what to look for around the country on Election Day.\n\nAnd, Rick, good morning. Let's start with those two marquee governor's races.\n\nRICK KLEIN, ABC NEWS WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF: Yeah. Good morning, Martha.\n\nVirginia and New Jersey, of course, both relatively blue states. So, Democrats losing either one of them would send a big message, but even if Democrats sweep on Tuesday, we're going to see how much the political winds have shifted since last year.\n\nIf you look at the polls in New Jersey, where you just spent some time on the ground, the Democrat Mikie Sherrill with a narrow but pretty consistent lead over her opponent Jack Ciattarelli. As you mentioned, Ciattarelli came close to winning the governor's race back in 2021, but it is still a heavily Democratic state. It's worth noting nearly every part of the state has shifted to the right between 2020 and 2024, particularly, you see this trend in North Jersey where large numbers of Black and Hispanic voters in particular reflected a national trend of voting Republican a year ago, far more than they have in recent elections.\n\nThe question Tuesday, Martha, is whether those voters show up again and vote Republican, or if Democrats have some momentum back with them now that Trump is in the White\n\nKLEIN: Yeah. In Virginia, the state has been trending Democratic over the last couple of decades. And if recent polls hold, the Democrat, Abigail Spanberger, is poised to defeat the Republican, Winsome Earle-Sears. She's the current Lieutenant Governor of the state. Now, that wouldn't come as a surprise. In governor's races, the state almost always votes against the party in the White House, including in 2021 when Governor Glenn Youngkin won just a year after President Biden was elected.\n\nRADDATZ: And Rick, let's not forget New York City, New York City's preparing for one of the most consequential elections in the city's history.\n\nKLEIN: Yeah, and this could easily be the biggest story coming out of Tuesday night. Polls show Zohran Mamdani, the 34-year-old self-described Democratic socialist, well ahead of his opponents. And what's striking here is how much interest has been in this election. Almost 600,000 New Yorkers have already cast their ballots in early voting. That has already smashed the record for a mayoral election in New York.\n\nMamdani represents generational as well as ideological change. National Republicans are actually probably even more eager than Democrats to see him rise to prominence, given his calls for higher taxes on corporations and the wealthy, and his past calls which he has since reversed, to defund the police.\n\nRADDATZ: We certainly have seen him reverse those. And finally, Rick, Democrats are counting on California to approve new congressional maps on Tuesday.\n\nKLEIN: Yeah, Martha, we've seen this highly unusual redistricting nationwide, all of these states either considering or already have adopted new maps. This is Democrats' biggest chance to swing back at the Republican advantage. Until now, it has been all Republican. The new maps that have passed at President Trump's urgings in states, including Texas and Missouri, North Carolina, Ohio, those moves could net Republicans as many as nine more seats in the midterms next year.\n\nBut Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom, he pushed through a new map that could net his party up to five additional seats. This is what the map would look like. The number of Republicans would go down potentially from nine to four. And if voters make that a reality on Tuesday, it's a big, big change. Although, even if it passes, it's worth noting, Republicans are likely to get a lot more out of redistricting than Democrats.\n\nIt looks like they'll get a handful of seats at least, out of this in an election where the balance of power just could not be tighter next year, Martha.\n\nRADDATZ: And they will no doubt be trying to do that. Our Washington Bureau Chief, Rick Klein, thanks so much.\n\nUp next, our Business Correspondent, Elizabeth Schulze takes a deeper dive into how the economy could impact Tuesday's vote. And later, our Powerhouse Roundtable.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nRADDATZ: In our new ABC News/\"Washington Post\"/Ipsos poll, some 52 percent of Americans say the economy has gotten worse since Donald Trump took office. Nearly double the 27 percent who say it has improved.\n\nABC's Elizabeth Schulze takes a closer look at why the economy is front and center in voters' minds.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\nELIZABETH SCHULZE, ABC NEWS CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Nearly a year since Donald Trump's economic pitch to voters helped propel his return to the White House --\n\nDONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We will rapidly drive prices down and make America affordable again.\n\nSCHULZE (voice over): A tale of two economies emerging.\n\nTRUMP: We're doing numbers that nobody's ever seen before.\n\nZOHRAN MAMDANI, (D) NEW YORK MAYORAL NOMINEE: This is the most expensive city in the United States of America, and it's time to make it affordable.\n\nSCHULZE (voice over): On paper, the U.S. economy is humming along, growth is solid, unemployment remains near historic lows, and the stock market keeps hitting records. But prices are also increasing, and economists say President Trump's tariffs are a key reason why.\n\nJEROME POWELL, FEDERAL RESERVE CHAIR: There will be some additional increased inflation because it takes a while for tariffs to work their way through the -- through the production chain.\n\nSCHULZE (voice over): In the past year, prices are up for most basic essentials. The latest government inflation report shows utility bills are up 12 percent in one year. Electricity bills up 5 percent, day care costs up 5 percent, rent up 3.5 percent, and food prices up 3 percent.\n\nJULIE LUSENI, CLINICAL TECHNICIAN: Everything has gone up. Everything.\n\nSCHULZE (voice over): We spent an afternoon with Julie Luseni, a clinical technician at a hospital, and single mom of three in Virginia, who's struggling to keep food on the table. After paying for groceries, bills, and rent, Julie says she only has $100 left until she receives her next paycheck.\n\nLUSENI: It's really tough, to the point that like even when school is about to start, my kids will literally just have either two pair of shoes for like the whole year.\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\nSCHULZE (on camera): And, Martha, this really is a tale of two economies. The top 10 percent of households account for almost half of all consumer spending right now, in many ways propping up the broader economy. And those cost of living concerns don't appear to be going anywhere, with the typical household now spending $208 more per month on the same goods and services than they were at this time last year.\n\nThe roundtable takes on Tuesday's elections and the shutdown stalemate when we come back.\n\nRADDATZ: And the roundtable's all here. Former DNC chair Donna Brazile, former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, and author and journalist, Molly Ball.\n\nGood to see all of you.\n\nAnd, Chris, I want to get right to you. Former governor of New Jersey, talk about this race in New Jersey and what you're seeing with Mikie Sherrill.\n\nCHRIS CHRISTIE, (R) FORMER NEW JERSEY GOVERNOR & ABC NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Look, Martha, this is a really tough state for my party. Give you context. We've elected one Republican United States senator in the last 50 years, one Republican governor in the last 25 years.\n\nAnd let me tell you, when I got -- when I ran, there was no road map for how to win New Jersey as a Republican in the 21st century. No one had done it. But we've laid the path for Jack Ciattarelli.\n\nThis is what he's going to have to do to beat Mike Sherrill -- 70 percent of the white vote, 21 percent of the black vote. We won 51 percent of the Hispanic vote. We beat a female candidate, as he is running against this time, by 15 points. And we won 58 percent of independents.\n\nWith 850,000 more Democrats than Republicans, that's what you need to do.\n\nSo, the question for him on Tuesday night is, can he hit those numbers?\n\nThose are the numbers you have to hit to win in a state like New Jersey. The path has been laid out. We'll see what he can do.\n\nRADDATZ: You think he can do it?\n\nCHRISTIE: I -- look, I think it's possible because the one other thing that's going on here, Martha, is Democrat excitement is not way up there regarding Mikie Sherrill. What you see happening is there's anger towards Donald Trump among Democrats. Will that translate into votes for Mikie Sherrill?\n\nRADDATZ: And, Donna, let's talk about the Democrats and in Virginia as well. What are you seeing in both races? Do you see Mikie Sherrill taking this and Spanberger in Virginia?\n\nDONNA BRAZILE, FORMER DNC CHAIR & ABC NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, you know, New Jersey is seen as -- the electorate at least is seen as very -- is like elastic. Everybody thinks you can stretch it. Donald Trump came within six points. In 2020, Joe Biden beat Trump by 16 percentage points. Kamala Harris only beat him by six points. The Republicans made significant inroads in New Jersey, Chris.\n\nAnd I remember on election night a year ago, that at 10:45, I looked at him, and I said, \"What the hell is going on in Passaic County?\" I mean, I know New Jersey. And I was like, \"Chris, what's happening?\" Because Trump was shifting the electorate.\n\nMikie Sherrill had two main challenges. One, she's dealing with a relatively unpopular governor, so she had to become her own candidate. I think she's done a fantastic job, you know, talking about her past in the Navy, talking about being a prosecutor. I think she has made up a lot of difference and the enthusiasm is there.\n\nIn Virginia, there's no question. Early voting is really good for Democrats, but as you know, same day Republicans can make up a lot of ground.\n\nSo, I'm optimistic on both sides.\n\nRADDATZ: You really think the enthusiasm is there for Sherrill? Because you -- I didn't get a sense of that up there from some of those voters.\n\nBRAZILE: Look, right now, people are not in love with politics. They're not in love with anybody. They're so angry about the affordability crisis.\n\nThat's why I think what the congresswoman is doing and you know, \"Drive Down the Cost\" bus tour. She's really getting Democrats excited and I do believe that she has a slight chance of winning.\n\nRADDATZ: And, Molly, the other thing that Sherrill is doing is talking about Donald Trump nonstop. That -- she's obviously talking about the economy, a big deal, but Donald Trump, Donald Trump. She's running against Donald Trump.\n\nMOLLY BALL, POLITICAL REPORT AND AUTHOR & FORMER WALL STREET JOURNAL SENIOR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: Because if there is any enthusiasm in the Democratic base, that is what it is for. It's the millions of people coming out for the \"No Kings\" protests. It's the people telling pollsters that they're excited to vote in the midterms next year. It's the overwhelming turnout we've seen in the special elections here and there over the past year.\n\nThe enthusiasm in the Democratic base is an anti-Trump enthusiasm. And so, that's what I think you see both Sherrill and Spanberger trying to tap into in order to try to get their base out.\n\nIt is, I think, though, a missed opportunity for both of these women, both of whom are sort of moderate, centrist, establishment Democrats. They've run very safe campaigns. And what they haven't done is really lay down a marker for their vision for the future of the Democratic Party -- a vision that is not the vision of a Zohran Mamdani, a vision that is much more I think they would say sort of unifying and centrist. And they haven't really articulated what that would mean for the party to go in that direction.\n\nRADDATZ: And, Chris, I want to get back to -- to the governor's races in particular. Donald Trump is not going to be out there on the campaign trail, and the base certainly wants to see Donald Trump and pulled out a lot of voters.\n\nWhen you look at the polling and you know how far New Jersey has lurched to the right, talk about that change and how that happened and what they do without a Donald Trump.\n\nCHRISTIE: Look, I think the move to the right in New Jersey was based on two things. One, it was a rejection of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. I think they came in arguing that they were going to make the country more civil, more centrist, and in fact, they went very far to the left. And that angered the most important voters in New Jersey, Martha, the independents.\n\nThere are more independents than there are Democrats or Republicans in New Jersey, and you have to play to them. Secondly, it's affordability. And we've heard everybody talking about that, and that's a problem as well. The problem for Republicans is that Trump in New Jersey is anywhere right now from 12 to 15 points underwater.\n\nAnd Jack Ciattarelli has made his association with the president a big part of his campaign. So, those two things are in conflict, right? So what I'd say to you, Martha, is it's winnable for Jack Ciattarelli. Can he go out and mobilize the voters he needs to do it? If he does, he can win; if he doesn't, Mikie Sherrill will win.\n\nRADDATZ: And Molly talked about Mamdani. Donna, when you look at this race on Tuesday, if Mamdani wins, which he is projected to do, and Sherrill and Spanberger win, more moderates, what does that say about where the Democratic Party is and what does it say where you'll be next year with the midterms?\n\nBRAZILE: Well, first of all, in addition to the great city of New York, we have Detroit who will likely elect a female mayor. We also have Cleveland, Miami. So we have lots of elections, also in the state of Pennsylvania with Supreme Court Justice races and of course, California with that big redistricting bill.\n\nI think it is going to say to the Democrats, who have won a lot of special elections this year, that we have to be more organized, more focused, more organic. We have to speak in the now language, not the 20th century language. And if Democrats can engage voters year round, I think Democrats have a chance of coming back in 2026.\n\nCHRISTIE: Martha, can I just say? It will be generational. I think what's going on in New York is less about ideology than it is generational.\n\nBRAZILE: Yeah.\n\nCHRISTIE: In the Democratic primary, you ran, no disrespect to me, a lot of old white guys in the primary against Zohran Mamdani. He stood out in the way he communicated and how he appealed, less about his message I think than about that generational change. And I think Democrats need to look at that.\n\nRADDATZ: And Molly, I want to also talk about this shutdown and what effect that has. Nothing's going to happen until the government opens up again. And you heard everybody this morning, Senator Kaine and Duffy -- Secretary Duffy talk about this. Where is it? Senator Kaine mentioned kind of that there might be some progress.\n\nBALL: Well, the progress is all, as you said to Senator Kaine, it's all among the rank and file. The leaders still are not talking to each other. And nothing, as you know, happens in Congress until the leaders talk to one another. I do hear from my sources on Capitol Hill that they think there's a possibility for a breakthrough after the election on Tuesday. That that might be the impetus for people to try to come together in some way.\n\nBut this has been the strangest shutdown because there is just no urgency there. It's gone on for so long. It's starting to affect people. We see in the polling, Americans are not happy with it. They don't like shutdowns. But it just has not been the sort of consuming story that would light a fire under people. And even in this new polling that we have, we see that the numbers haven't really budged.\n\nPeople blame the Republicans slightly more, but that's not changing. There's no momentum for one side or the other. And so, I just think you have two sides that are so dug in and neither of them really sees any reason to come to the table and resolve it.\n\nBRAZILE: I miss the gangs. The Gang of Six, the Gang of Eight. They normally would come in at the last minute and pull things together. We need those gangs to come back, those gangs of leaders.\n\nRADDATZ: And maybe they will, because I think next week will be pretty bad, as Secretary Duffy pointed out, maybe that will be the catalyst. Thanks to all of you.\n\nUp next, President Trump says the U.S. will resume nuclear weapons testing. Senator Ed Markey warns that could lead to a new nuclear arms race. I'll speak with him when we come back.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: Are you talking about literally resuming underground nuclear detonation tests?\n\nDONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: You'll find out very soon, but we're going to do some testing. Yes. Other countries do it. If they're going to do it, we're going to do it.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: But can -- you can't clarify whether we'll resume --\n\nTRUMP: I'm not going to say yet. I'm going to know exactly what we're doing, where we're doing it, but other countries are doing it and if other countries do it, we do it.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nRADDATZ: President Trump on Friday responding to questions about his call for the U.S. to resume nuclear testing.\n\nI'm joined now by Senator Ed Markey. He's the founder of the National Nuclear Freeze Movement and has been working to end proliferation of nuclear weapons since the beginning of his career. And he has introduced legislation to stop renewed nuclear testing.\n\nIt's good to see you this morning, Senator Markey. The president was quite clear midweek that he wants to resume nuclear testing and to keep up with those who are doing it. The U.S. hasn't had a test since '92. North Korea was the last to test a nuclear weapon in 2017.\n\nWhat do you think he's talking about, and what will happen?\n\nSEN. ED MARKEY (D-MA): Well, first, he's wrong. Other countries are not engaging in nuclear testing. The Russians, the Chinese, they have not tested since at least 1996, when the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty was put into effect. And it would be a gift to China, it would be a gift to Russia. Chinese have only tested 45 times. We've tested more than a thousand times. So it would give them an ability to catch up to us with the sophistication of their nuclear weapons technology.\n\nWhat I think he's responding to is the announcement by Putin that they are testing missile delivery systems for nuclear bombs. That's a different subject altogether. And the reason that Russia, the reason that China is developing new missile delivery systems is that the United States pulled out of the anti-ballistic missile system. It is because Donald Trump has announced that he is going to deploy a golden dome over our country.\n\nThousands of satellites with interceptors on them to knock down incoming Russian or Chinese missiles, with nuclear bombs on them. And that has led those countries to develop more and more sophisticated nuclear missiles to circumvent the boondoggle, which will be the golden dome, which our own experts say will not work. It will be a golden sieve, which will allow ultimately for enough nuclear weapons to penetrate it to destroy cities across our country and kill at least 100 million people.\n\nSo Donald Trump and Trumpatomics is going to make our country less safe, it's going to make the world less dangerous, and the only way to avoid it is to go to a negotiating table, for Donald Trump to accept the invitation from Putin, to extend the New START Treaty which expires in 100 days, and to then put all of these other weapons systems, offensive and defensive, on the table for negotiations. And that's the only way we're going to make our country and the world safer.\n\nRADDATZ: And Senator Markey, on the show last week, we talked about a new film called \"A House of Dynamite\" by Director Kathryn Bigelow, depicts what might happen if a nuclear missile came to the U.S. was launched toward the U.S.\n\nAnd there's a line in the movie that says, it's a coin toss, whether we could intercept it. The Pentagon apparently has some problems with that, saying we've been a hundred percent successful in a memo that was leaked to Bloomberg. Your response to that quickly, if you can.\n\nMARKEY: That's inaccurate. Our own missile defense system, our own missile defense agency says that we're only effective 50 percent of the time and that's in ideal conditions. That's not with decoys, that's not with other means that would try to misdirect our interceptors from knocking down incoming missiles with nuclear warheads on them. So that's completely erroneous.\n\nWhat the movie says -- what the movie \"House of Dynamite\" is giving us as a Cassandra-like warning is that defense systems do not work against offensive weapons with nuclear warheads on those delivery systems. And the only way to avoid that catastrophic moment, that Armageddon-like moment is to sit down at the negotiating table in order to get agreements with other countries on a verifiable basis to make sure that we do not make the world more dangerous.\n\nThat's what Donald Trump's Golden Dome is doing. That's what the United States' pulling out of the ABM Treaty has done.\n\nRADDATZ: Senator, I'm going to have to stop you there, but we appreciate your time this morning. Thank you. We'll be right back.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nRADDATZ: And thanks for sharing part of your Sunday with us.

Gavin Newsom's tenure was marked by devastating wildfires in Los Angeles, a steady...", "content": "Newsom has discarded Democrats' \"when they go low, we go high\" mantra.\n\nAt the beginning of the year, California Gov. Gavin Newsom's tenure was marked by devastating wildfires in Los Angeles, a steady stream of ridicule from the White House, and backlash from within the Democratic Party for siding with conservatives on transgender athletes in women's sports.\n\nNot to mention, in the summer of 2021, Newsom weathered a blistering attempt to recall him from office -- his starpower at risk.\n\nYet the twice-elected governor has pulled off a reputational heel turn, marked by viral Trump-mocking social media posts and parody MAGA merch coupled with a statewide redistricting measure that would level Republican's attempt to get an edge ahead of next year's midterms.\n\nNow, Newsom is a leader running miles ahead of others, experts explained to ABC News.\n\nOne of the most noticeable transformations was the rebrand of Newsom's official governor social media account. A senior Newsom official told ABC that the weekend of June 6, when the team learned the president was federalizing the National Guard into Los Angeles, was when the \"red line\" was crossed, and a more defiant version of the Democratic governor debuted.\n\n\"That is when everything changed, with the governor, with our social media,\" the official said.\n\nOn June 10, Newsom's @GovPressOffice account shared a TikTok video, where a voiceover, in the style of a Star Wars villain, mimicked Trump's TruthSocial post announcing the federalization of troops. That post generated over 800,000 views.\n\nThe salvo continued. The same day, Newsom, on Instagram, responded to Trump mocking him as \"Newscum\" on Truth Social with a diss-video set to the Taylor Swift (another common Trump target) song \"You Need To Calm Down,\" dismissing Trump as \"keyboard warrior.\" That short video has 11.3 million views.\n\nThe mocking never let up.\n\nA non-exhaustive list of the incoming includes: accusing Trump of having \"Newsom Derangement Syndrome,\" a play on Trump's oft-referred \"Trump Derangement Syndrome;\" likening Trump adviser Stephen Miller to Voldemort, the villain from the Harry Potter series, and calling him submissive; calling Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem \"Kosplay Kristi\" and urging followers to \"hide yo dogs,\" a reference to Noem's infamous tale of shooting and killing her own dog, Cricket; mocking Vice President JD Vance over a debunked rumor that he performed sex acts with a couch; and comparing White House border czar Tom Homan to an uncooked ham.\n\nSince then, Newsom's social media accounts have skyrocketed. Follower counts across multiple platforms for his non-government account, @GavinNewsom, ballooned -- growing to more than 11 million followers collectively. Nearly half of those followers were new this year.\n\nOne of the official accounts, @GovPressOffice, has seen nearly 1 billion impressions on X since those first provocative posts in June, per Newsom's campaign.\n\nNewsom even launched his own \"patriot\" merchandise shop, repurposing Trump's Make America Great Again slogan -- Make America Gavin Again -- and selling REAL PATRIOT hats NEWSOM WAS RIGHT ABOUT EVERYTHING! And REAL PATRIOT hats, and kneepads marked with Trump's signature.\n\nA key mark in Newsom's success is upending the \"when they go low, we go high\" mantra coined by Michelle Obama in 2016, suggested Parker Butler, the former director of Kamala Harris' presidential campaign's buzzy social media channel, @KamalaHQ. \"That is not where we are right now.\"\n\n\"When we see democracy hanging by a thread, we have to take risks. It feels very unrestrained, that's the kind of energy that I think Democrats need,\" said Butler, now a digital strategist and co-founder at Luminary Strategies.\n\n\"We need to throw the sort of old rulebook out the window,\" Butler added.\n\nWhen Newsom launched his new solo podcast \"This is Gavin Newsom\" in March, he said he wanted to \"debate without demeaning\" and engage with people most members his party wouldn't dare to speak to. He called the Democratic brand \"toxic.\" He's positioned himself as a lefty alternative in the GOP-de-jour manosphere space. His interview with Charlie Kirk, for instance, has 1.3 million YouTube views.\n\n\"When we go low, or when they go low, we go high, doesn't work when they're trying to pull the rug out completely from under us,\" said Olivia Julianna, a Gen-Z digital strategist and activist who spoke at the Democratic National Convention. Julianna was outraged with Newsom at the start of the year, in part due to his right-wing podcast guests, but she now considers herself a huge fan -- she's even bought his merch.\n\n\"I did not take Gavin Newsom seriously until he made it clear that he was ready to take action,\" Julianna added.\n\nNewsom's longtime speechwriter and former deputy chief of staff Jason Eliott described the online mockery as a strategy of \"holding up a mirror to the clown show that is the Trump administration. We're not doing anything differently than what they are doing.\"\n\nElliott said the buzz around Newsom's posts creates space for the \"actual substantive work,\" like Proposition 50, the ballot initiative that, if approved by voters on Tuesday, will temporarily adopt a new congressional map that redraws five districts to be more Democratic-leaning, potentially flipping five existing Republican seats in the midterms. Elliott said that since the office has sharpened its tone, donations have poured in from millions of supporters.\n\n\"How do you get 1.2 million people from all 50 states all across the country to buy into this defense of democracy? You do it by getting attention,\" Eliott said.\n\nNewsom, in a recent interview with ABC News' Jonathan Karl, concurred.\n\n\"We're trying to have a little humor in this process as well, and we're fighting fire with fire, not just rhetorically, in the context of that back and forth, but substantively, we can get into the 43 lawsuits, we can get in the work we're trying to do on Prop 50,\" Newsom explained.\n\n\"We're trying to have a little humor in this process as well, and we're fighting fire with fire, not just rhetorically, in the context of that back and forth, but substantively, we can get into the 43 lawsuits, we can get in the work we're trying to do on Prop 50,\" Newsom explained.\n\nJohn Dennis, former chair of the San Francisco Republican Party, said Newsom's tactic is the latest iteration of what he and other critics call a history of \"shapeshifting.\"\n\n\"He doesn't know who he is. So he's trying to be everybody else,\" Dennis said.\n\nBut he admits it appears to be working.\n\n\"This Prop 50 move is a very clever move for the Democrats. And he's got good people around him,\" Dennis said. \"They know that Trump is the center of the universe right now so he's just keeping his name alive and positioning himself as the Trump fighter -- and he's going to run that all the way into the Democrat primaries.\"\n\nDan Schnur, a longtime California political analyst and UC-Berkeley professor, called the Proposition 50 campaign \"a self-delivered political gift for Newsom.\"\n\nNewsom's successes put him in a solid position to launch a presidential bid, an ambition Californians are under no illusions about.\n\n\"Every governor looks in the mirror and sees a president looking back at them, and Newsom probably whistles \"Hail to the Chief\" when he's in the shower every morning,\" Schnur said. \"It's hard to predict exactly how the race plays out, but the governor of the largest state in the country, who is also the most visible and impactful Trump critic, and who has access to tremendous amounts of fundraising dollars could be a pretty formidable contender.\"", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/US/gavin-newsom-gambling-new-rules-trump-20/story?id=126900405"}

Epstein reported from Alexandria, Va.\n\nRepresentative Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey stood in front of a train station in a downpour last week, lamenting the demise of a Hudson River rail tunnel after President Trump said he \"terminated\" federal funding for it.\n\nFour hours south, in a suburban Mexican restaurant, former Representative Abigail Spanberger of Virginia delivered a stump speech entirely devoted to her plans to fight the Trump administration.\n\nNeither woman is technically running against the president in their races for governor. But they might as well be.\n\n\"There's only one thing he seems to care about, and that is making sure he never gets crosswise with Donald Trump,\" Ms. Sherrill told the small crowd of supporters and commuters about her opponent, Jack Ciattarelli, a Republican whom she has labeled the \"Trump of Trenton.\"\n\n\"That's not who I am going to serve as your governor,\" she added.\n\nIn 2018, Ms. Spanberger and Ms. Sherrill rode a wave of anti-Trump energy to win Republican districts and political stardom. Both campaigned then as moderate moms with national security backgrounds.\n\nThat center-left strategy -- and the educated, suburban political coalition it activated -- became a model for Democrats in the elections that followed in 2020 and 2022.\n\nNow, with Mr. Trump back in the White House, the two women are positioning themselves as the second coming of Democratic opposition, hoping to once again ride a crest of liberal anger toward the president to power.\n\nLess than a year after a presidential election that sent Democrats into the political wilderness, Ms. Spanberger and Ms. Sherrill are testing whether that old strategy still works for a party scarred by its 2024 defeat.\n\nAmid months of tortured political soul searching, other Democrats have tried to address their party's failings with new strategies.\n\nIn New York City, Zohran Mamdani, the front-runner for mayor, powered a come-from-behind campaign with bold progressive promises, social media prowess and a fiercely liberal message that promises to upend the party establishment. In California, Gov. Gavin Newsom has abandoned the party's longstanding preference for abiding by political norms to champion an extraordinary effort to approve a new congressional map, pushing back on similar Republican moves and trying to maximize Democratic power.\n\nBut in New Jersey and Virginia, Ms. Spanberger and Ms Sherrill have decided to stick with reruns rather than pilot new programming.\n\n\"Amid all of the chaos coming out of Washington and all of this unsteadiness that is hurting so many of our communities, we are going to elect a governor who will stand up for Virginia,\" Ms. Spanberger told the crowd packed into the Mexican restaurant on an affluent stretch of suburban Alexandria's Del Ray neighborhood.\n\nLongtime roommates in Washington and close friends, Ms. Spanberger and Ms. Sherrill have taken similar approaches in their campaigns for governor.\n\nAs in 2018, both have structured their races as referendums on Washington, casting their opponents as lackeys to a powerful president and promising to fight Mr. Trump's agenda on issues from tariffs to abortion rights. National Democrats have positioned the races as the first opportunity for their powerless party to mount a comeback.\n\n\"You've got the DOGE cuts, federal contractors getting fired and layoffs and the government shutdown, plus all the other insanity of the Trump administration,\" said former Gov. Terry McAuliffe of Virginia. \"This is as good as it gets to be on the ballot as a Democrat.\"\n\nMs. Sherrill sees similarities between her race for governor and her initial run for Congress. Many of the issues that are a focus of her effort -- taxes, health care and the commuter rail tunnel -- are the same (though there also new topics, like rising costs from tariffs and high electricity prices.)\n\nBut Mr. Trump's total control over the Republican Party pushed Mr. Ciattarelli, who was endorsed by the president, to embrace elements of the president's agenda and shifted the tone of Ms. Sherrill's campaign away from talk of bipartisanship.\n\nDuring her first campaign, Ms. Sherrill said in an interview, \"there were still credible people in the Republican Party, and you were able to really make your argument and then bring a bipartisan coalition of people together around issues.\"\n\nThis time, she said: \"It's been more hard hitting.\"\n\nViews of her own party have changed, too. Just 30 percent voters said they had a favorable view of Democrats in a Quinnipiac University survey this fall, compared to nearly half who said the same in a poll conducted by CNN in October 2018.\n\n\"That experience in 2018 of flipping districts, like we all did, was really the formative experience,\" said Representative Jason Crow, a Colorado Democrat who also won his seat in 2018 and remains close with both Ms. Spanberger and Ms. Sherrill. Now, he says, \"There is discontent with the Democratic Party and there's discontent with some of the political leadership and people are wanting and demanding more.\"\n\nWhile both Ms. Spanberger and Ms. Sherrill have a record of bucking their own party leadership at times, neither woman is leading the conversation over the future of the Democratic Party.\n\nThat's a discussion better left to the many Democrats already eyeing what's widely expected to be a crowded presidential primary field in 2028, said Dan Sena, a Democratic strategist who oversaw the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee's strategy to win the House in 2018.\n\n\"For a governor, I'm not sure you want a firebrand in this day and age -- you want a steady hand to guide the values that matter most to your state,\" said Mr. Sena, who is working for a super PAC supporting Ms. Sherrill. \"There is still great power in candidates who have records of service and are independent minded.\"\n\nBut, some Democrats warn, the party's seven-year-old strategy of focusing on rejecting the president may eventually run its course.\n\n\"2028 could be a totally different animal,\" Senator Ruben Gallego of Arizona said after speaking at Ms. Spanberger's Virginia stop Thursday afternoon.\n\nNew Jersey and Virginia are the only states that elect governors in the year after a presidential race, a position that frequently transforms their contests into a quadrennial check on an administration's first year in office and has sometimes catapulted the victors into national figures.\n\nMr. Trump, who still motivates the Democratic base like no other political figure, is an irresistible target for Democrats. Polling shows that 56 percent of likely voters in New Jersey and 57 percent in Virginia disapprove of the way he is handling his job as president.\n\n\"The boogeyman is Trump,\" said Mo Butler, a Democratic political consultant and a former chief of staff to Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey. \"It's very difficult for a Democratic candidate -- especially statewide in this environment when Trump is president -- it's very difficult for them not to run that sort of campaign.\"\n\nMs. Spanberger's stump speech in the closing days of her campaign touched on the main points of Trump grievance for Democrats: the sprawling cuts to the federal work force -- an issue particularly acute in Virginia -- the president's erratic tariff and trade policy, cuts to health care spending and aggressive immigration enforcement and deportations.\n\nThose campaigning for her were more direct.\n\n\"What is happening is not OK,\" Alfonso Lopez, a member of the Virginia House of Delegates, told the crowd in Alexandria.\n\nIt is helpful for Ms. Spanberger to have drawn one of the weakest Republican opponents in recent memory. Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears has raised about half as much money as Ms. Spanberger and won only a tepid endorsement from Mr. Trump, late in the campaign.\n\n.\n\nMs. Sherrill has faced a tougher opponent in Mr. Ciattarelli, who has tried to combine some of the president's signature issues, like cracking down on immigration and transgender rights, with his focus on lowering taxes, public safety and improving schools.\n\nShe is attempting to replace Gov. Philip D. Murphy, a Democratic who is finishing his second term. Democrats have not won three consecutive governor's elections in the state since 1961.\n\nWith 860,000 more registered Democrats in the state than Republicans, the question for Ms. Sherrill is whether her anti-Trump message will be enough to mobilize Democrats, particularly Black and Latino voters who shifted right during the 2024 election.\n\nAs she crisscrossed the state on Thursday, Ms. Sherrill assailed both her opponent and Mr. Trump, linking the agendas of the two men over and over again.\n\nAllies made the stakes even more explicit to the crowd.\n\n\"You get to send a message right here in New Jersey that a free people bows to no king,\" Pete Buttigieg, the former secretary of transportation, told a cheering crowd at a campaign rally on Thursday. \"Not three years from now, but this coming Tuesday.\"\n\nRepresentative Frank Pallone, Democrat of New Jersey, made the stakes even more explicit to the crowd: \"Don't bring MAGA into New Jersey,\" he pleaded.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/02/us/politics/virginia-new-jersey-democrats.html"}

Gavin Newsom is part of a national redistricting battle that began when Trump urged GOP-run states to help him keep a friendly House majority in 2026.\n\nAt an afternoon rally in Norfolk, Obama praised Spanberger, a former congresswoman and CIA case officer, as a hard worker who would improve Virginians' financial circumstances and quality of life.

A collapse in its $446 billion real estate economy would bring California to its knees. Gov. Gavin Newsom's administration went into crisis negotiations with the insurance industry, and emerged in September 2023, with what was billed as an \"historic\" compromise, one that would reward insurers with higher rates in exchange for protecting homeowners in neighborhoods that climate change was turning into tinder boxes.\n\nThe central promise was that insurers would have to write policies in fire-prone areas at a rate equal to at least 85 percent of their market share across the state. But a New York Times investigation has found that a series of loopholes quietly negotiated by the insurance industry all but eliminated that guarantee.\n\nVast swaths of the designated areas where insurers must write new policies do not in fact overlap with areas that California's state fire marshal deems to be the most fire-prone, the investigation found, meaning that insurers can load up on coverage in areas the state considers to be safer and still qualify to charge higher rates.\n\nAs a result, insurance companies will be able to raise rates and offload billions of dollars in costs and liabilities to ratepayers while taking on few, if any, new customers in high fire-risk areas.\n\nAnd while the regulations were billed as an attempt to get homeowners off the state's toverburdened last-resort insurance program, FAIR, the number of residential FAIR policies has nearly doubled since the new insurance deal was announced, rising to 625,033 from 320,581, the Times review found.\n\nSome insurers began minimizing their potential losses even before the new regulations were finalized. In the six months after the deal was announced, California's three largest insurance groups informed the state of their plans to dump nearly 50,000 existing policies, five times the number filed by those companies in the 20 months preceding the deal. And the new regulations will effectively reward them for doing it.\n\nMore than a fifth of the nonrenewals -- about 11,000 policies in total -- were in ZIP codes within or adjacent to areas that would burn in the January fires, the Times analysis found. The vast majority of those were in and around Pacific Palisades, where fire later destroyed more than 6,800 structures.\n\nMaggie Neilson, a 53-year-old philanthropy consultant, had a policy from Foremost on her 2,500-square-foot house in Pacific Palisades until the company elected not to renew it in March 2024.\n\nThe only insurer Ms. Neilson could find to replace the policy was the FAIR plan, which charged her about 40 percent more than Foremost had for about 40 percent less coverage. \"At the time, the media was saying everyone knows this is a problem and the governor and others are working on it, so I didn't think too much about it,\" she said.\n\nThen in January, her home and all of its contents were destroyed by the Palisades fire. She said her FAIR policy will pay her $1.5 million for a rebuild that she has been told will cost around $3 million.\n\nProponents of the new rules said they would allow rates to reflect the risks of hotter, drier weather and provide a business case for insurers to offer policies in high-risk areas. Representatives for Farmers Insurance, one of the few companies that agreed to discuss the regulations, praised them as a \"return to a more effective rating regime\" that \"will bring positive change to the California insurance marketplace.\"\n\nRicardo Lara, California's elected state insurance commissioner who led the drafting of the new rules, said the state was \"in crisis mode\" when it negotiated the new regulations, with seven of the 12 top insurers in the state halting or restricting the writing of new policies in California.\n\n\"You constantly have to strike the balance between, you know, the consumer protections, giving consumers options, and having a robust and thriving insurance market,\" Mr. Lara said.\n\nHe said the new rules would offer tens of thousands of Californians the chance to purchase protection for their homes that might otherwise have been unavailable at any price.\n\nConfronted with The Times' findings about ways insurers could shortchange their promises to insure in high-risk areas, Mr. Lara conceded that the rules might not deliver the hoped-for outcomes immediately. Insurers, he said, had \"bullied\" the state as it drafted the new rules. But he predicted that, as rates rose, competition would eventually push insurers back into writing policies in high-risk zones.\n\n\"This is uncharted territory,\" he said. \"Will this be perfect? Absolutely not.\"\n\nNo Insurance, No Housing\n\nFrom the insurance industry's perspective, the roots of the current crisis can be traced back to 1988. Voters passed an initiative that year that made California one of about a dozen states where homeowners' insurance rate increases must be preapproved by an elected insurance commissioner. The industry has long complained that the system keeps rates in California artificially low.\n\nBy the early spring of 2023, when Governor Newsom began meeting with industry lobbyists, some of California's largest property insurers had already stopped or curtailed writing new business in the state. State Farm and Farmers, which together comprise one third of the market, started pulling back in May and July of that year.\n\nExisting policies were not affected, but the changes meant that home buyers were left with few options for insuring their new properties other than the FAIR plan, a consortium of all the companies licensed to offer property insurance in the state. FAIR is required by law to sell bare-bones fire policies to people who can't find coverage in the regular market.Insurers share any profits from FAIR in good times, but must cover all of its losses.\n\n\"I think that was the moment when we really started to get nervous,\" recalled Ann Patterson, a senior counselor to the governor who was involved in the discussions. \"We only have so many more big carriers that can pick up that demand, and if they can't pick it up, then everybody's going to end up on the FAIR plan.\"\n\nIt was generally agreed that FAIR was not a solution. Its lean policies rarely covered the actual cost to rebuild a home, even though they generally cost more than regular policies. Nearly 7 percent of realtors surveyed in 2023 by the California Association of Realtors said that they had deals fall out of escrow that year because buyers couldn't find adequate, affordable coverage.\n\nIt was not a problem just for wealthy homeowners in Brentwood and Malibu. Nearly a third of California's 40 million residents live in or near highly flammable, brushy or densely forested wildlands.\n\nInsurers made it clear that big, regulatory changes were needed to keep them in the market, addressing rising construction costs as well as climate change.\n\nCalifornia requires companies to provide detailed financial information justifying rate-increase requests; if they seek 7 percent or more, the requests can be challenged in public hearings and take up to a year to resolve.\n\nHistorically, wildfire losses figured in those calculations, but insurers had to show data on their actual payouts. They wanted California regulators to instead join other states in allowing rates based on climate-change models that estimate future losses.\n\nSeren Taylor, vice president of the Personal Insurance Federation of California, the lead lobbying group for insurers in California, said rate increases will help avert a serious threat to the state's economy. \"You don't have to care about insurers per se, but you have to care about having a healthy insurance market,\" he said. \"We had to give insurers the tools they need to have a functional market.\"\n\nThe 85 Percent Promise\n\nThe deal with insurers, as described by Mr. Lara when he announced it, contained an unambiguous promise: If carriers wanted to charge higher rates, they would have to write policies in \"fire zones\" at a rate \"no less\" than 85 percent of their statewide market share.\n\nIf a carrier's statewide market share is 20 percent, for example, its share in designated distressed areas would have to be at least 17 percent.\n\nTo reach the 85 percent standard, insurers can offer policies to homeowners currently on the FAIR plan, though nothing requires them to do that. Or they can write policies anywhere in a list of 662 distressed ZIP codes.\n\nSome of those ZIP codes neatly overlap the state's high-fire-risk zone maps, like the one covering Topanga, a town known for its hippie scene. Topanga sits in a steep, rugged canyon in the Santa Monica Mountains that can become a wind tunnel, where embers can be blown for miles.\n\nBut the Times analysis found that many \"distressed\" ZIP codes extend well beyond the riskiest fire zones. The 90063 area, for instance, is in the dense heart of urban East Los Angeles, with only a small sliver overlapping areas deemed at high risk of a blaze -- and that sliver has no homes in it at all.\n\nAnd half of California's 58 counties qualify under the regulations as \"distressed\" in their entirety, even though only a minority of the single-family homes located within them are in high or very high fire risk zones. In Ventura County, which sprawls from urban strip malls and moist strawberry fields to forested peaks, more than 100,000 homes, or roughly 60 percent of the county's single-family structures, are clustered in areas with lower wildfire risk. Yet insuring any of them would help a company meet the 85 percent target.\n\nPlacer County, just north of Sacramento, stretches east from suburbs dominated by new subdivisions with few mature trees into the pine-covered slopes of the Sierra Nevada mountains, where rugged terrain and dense vegetation create a higher fire danger.\n\nPolicies written anywhere in the county count toward the requirement.\n\nBut a savvy insurer could meet it by zeroing in on Roseville, a city of about 160,000 residents whose boundaries barely graze the high-risk zones -- in fact, one of its three main ZIP codes falls entirely outside the zones.\n\nIn more than 100 of the state's distressed ZIP codes, fewer than a third of single-family homes are in high-fire-risk zones, the Times analysis found. In more than 70 of the ZIP codes, less than 10 percent of homes are in those zones.\n\nMr. Lara's deputy commissioner, Mike Peterson, acknowledged in an interview that insurers will probably gravitate toward those lower-risk homes. But he predicted that those opportunities \"will be sucked up very quickly, which will force everybody into the more-fire-risk areas.\"\n\nInsurers who cannot or choose not to meet the 85-percent requirement can still qualify for the new rate increases. A pair of what industry lobbyists called \"offramps\" were negotiated as alternatives to the 85 percent rule. Insurers can claim hardship and petition the commissioner for a waiver; or they can take advantage of an option, originally intended just for small companies, that requires only that they increase the number of policies they have in the designated distressed zones by 5 percent over the previous year.\n\n\"We decided to include the 5 percent option in order to give all companies a way to incrementally get to the 85 percent target in a way that is sustainable and doesn't put their solvency at risk,\" said Michael Soller, Mr. Lara's spokesman.\n\nBut the way the provision was written meant that insurers that had spent much of 2024 dumping customers by the tens of thousands would, at least initially, be able to meet an even lower bar.\n\n'We Were Being Bullied'\n\nEight days after the deal was announced in September 2023, Foremost Insurance reported that it had already begun to drop policies in fire-prone areas across the state.\n\nOver the following five months, as Mr. Lara's office was writing the regulations, three insurers followed suit: Farmers Insurance, CSAA and State Farm.\n\nThese companies told Mr. Lara that they would be dropping more than 50,000 policies in more than 800 ZIP codes, heavily concentrated in the most fire-prone areas of the state.\n\nThis was a different thing entirely than declining to write policies for new customers. It meant that even people whose homes met underwriting standards and who had paid their premiums on time weren't safe.\n\nBesides Pacific Palisades and other Los Angeles County communities like Calabasas and Brentwood, some of the hardest-hit neighborhoods were in Contra Costa, Santa Cruz and Santa Clara counties, the Times review found. In one ZIP code in Los Gatos, a forested town pressed up against the foothills of the Santa Cruz mountains, State Farm indicated that it would dump two out of three of its customers, and Farmers said it would dump half.\n\nYvette Curran got her nonrenewal notice from Farmers n January 2024. Effective in April, the company would no longer insure her home in the hills north of Santa Cruz. She had been a loyal customer for 12 years.\n\n\"What do you do?\" she said. \"There's no nobody else to insure you.\"\n\nSimilar stories were unfolding across the state. In Lake County in Northern California, where more than 2,000 homes and 65 percent of the land area has burned in a series of devastating fires over the last decade, Foremost dropped the vast majority of its customers; Farmers also issued nonrenewal notices there, but was more selective.\n\n\"I can't go to the grocery store or walk into a coffee shop or go to a Rotary meeting where there isn't a couple or three folks who have a horrific story about being nonrenewed,\" said Mike McGuire, the California State Senate leader, who represents Lake County.\n\nRex Frazier, president of the Personal Insurance Federation of California, said the nonrenewals occurred at a time when insurers were not yet certain of what the final rules would be, and \"needed to respond to their mounting financial problems.\"\n\nBut Governor Newsom was frustrated, aides said. Insurers had issued nonrenewals in large numbers before, but this wave came after the industry and the state had struck their deal.\n\nMr. Lara said in an interview that he was angry, too. \"I was livid, and yes, I did feel like we were being bullied,\" he said. But whatever he felt privately, he said little in public, telling The Times that he felt it would be counterproductive to berate the very companies he was trying to woo back.\n\nYet the state effectively rewarded their behavior by grandfathering in the nonrenewals when it finalized the regulations. Companies like State Farm and Foremost that had dumped more than 5 percent of their customers in fire zones could now add back that 5 percent -- perhaps in a lower-risk part of a ZIP code -- and still qualify to charge the new higher rates.\n\nBy the time the department put the finishing touches on the regulatory package in December 2024, the state had offered two additional carrots to the industry. One was a cap on the amount of wildfire-related losses that insurance companies comprising the FAIR plan previously had to shoulder. Now, anything above $500 million would have to be borne by residential policyholders across the state. The other was to let insurers factor into their rate calculations the cost of reinsurance, which they buy to hedge the risk of an expensive catastrophe.\n\nConsumer Watchdog, an advocacy group that by law represents California policy holders in rate hearings, estimated that the reinsurance provision alone could raise premiums by an additional 40 percent.\n\nFallout from the Fire\n\nEight days after state officials put the final piece of the new regulations into place, wildfires swept through Los Angeles.\n\nIn their aftermath, Mr. Lara imposed a 1-year moratorium on nonrenewals, but only in the fire-affected areas. It will expire in January 2026.\n\nInsurers already have applied to charge their residential customers $425 million in losses incurred by the FAIR plan in the January fires, based on the new pass-through approved by Mr. Lara. Consumer Watchdog has filed a lawsuit challenging those assessments.\n\nThe incentive to shed customers in risky areas remains in place for insurers that have yet to file for rate increases under the new system.\n\nSo far, five companies -- serving 20 percent of the California market -- - have filed for increases. Mr. Lara said that is a promising sign that the new incentives are luring insurers back.\n\nBut the total number of policies they say they will add in distressed areas -- 2,500 -- is not really a net gain, because it does not take into account the number of policies that some of those same companies dropped since the deal was announced.\n\nThose companies now stand to collect nearly $250 million in additional premiums. Each filed for rate increases just under the 7 percent threshold that would trigger the requirement for public hearings, and could seek additional increases later.\n\nPeople living in hazardous fire zones will probably see rate hikes much larger, since the rate filing is an average, Mr. Lara's spokesman said.\n\nMeanwhile, the number of homeowners resorting to the FAIR plan has not gone down, as hoped, but doubled. Operators of the plan last month asked for a rate increase of nearly 36 percent. Nor have home buyers found it any easier to obtain insurance. The percentage of realtors reporting that they had deals fall through for lack of insurance has more than doubled since 2023, to 16.6 percent.\n\nThe trends so far suggest that the regulatory package will do little to help homeowners get the coverage they need, said Jamie Court, Consumer Watchdog's president.\n\n\"This isn't the balanced deal the insurance commissioner sold to Californians,\" he said. \"It's a giant giveaway to insurers.\"\n\nMr. Lara said state officials will not know if the overhaul worked for another year, at least.\n\nIn the meantime, he said, he was grateful for the Times analysis, and had asked his staff to be on the lookout for the issues it raised. He said the state would make adjustments if needed.\n\n\"There's no guarantees,\" he said. \"But our current system doesn't have guarantees, either.\"\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this investigation, The New York Times obtained and analyzed a range of data sources.\n\nCalifornia's Department of Insurance publishes a list of ZIP codes and counties that meet the new insurance regulations' definition of \"distressed.\" The Times cross-referenced those designations with the state's fire hazard maps (focusing, as the regulations do, on \"high\" and \"very high\" risk zones), as well as a Federal Emergency Management Agency data set of building outlines. This allowed reporters to compare the number of homes inside those hazard zones versus outside of them. The Times used ZIP code boundaries published by the state's Department of Technology, ultimately based on boundaries sourced from TomTom, and excluded ZIP codes containing fewer than 100 single-family home structures from those analyses.\n\nTo obtain data on thousands of policies that were canceled by insurers, known as \"block nonrenewals\" in industry parlance, The Times examined regulatory filings submitted by insurers. (That information is not otherwise readily available because the Department of Insurance does not publish statistics on block nonrenewals.) The Times focused on filings by companies in California's three largest homeowners insurance groups, measured by total \"direct premiums written\" in 2023: State Farm Group, Farmers Insurance Group (which also owns Foremost Insurance), and CSAA. These filings indicate the number nonrenewals being undertaken or planned in each California ZIP code. Because insurers do not indicate the specific date any given nonrenewal was planned, The Times analyses focused on the dates insurers submitted the relevant filing exhibits.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/01/us/los-angeles-california-fire-insurance-regulations.html"}

The effort backed by Gov. Gavin Newsom is part of a national redistricting battle that began when Trump urged GOP-run states to help him keep a friendly House majority in 2026.\n\nObama, the Democrat whom Trump succeeded when he first assumed the presidency, will appear first Saturday with Virginia's Democratic gubernatorial nominee Abigail Spanberger in Norfolk. Obama then travels to New Jersey for an evening rally with Democratic gubernatorial nominee Mikie Sherrill in Newark. Both events put the nation's first Black president in areas where Black voter turnout is key for Democratic victories.\n\nVirginia Republican nominee Winsome Earle-Sears, the current lieutenant governor, and New Jersey Republican Jack Ciattarelli, a former state lawmaker, have busy itineraries, as well.\n\nThe Virginia contest ensures the election of the first woman to lead the Commonwealth since its 1776 founding. If elected, Earle-Sears would be the first Black woman elected governor of any state.\n\nDemocratic Virginia House Speaker Don Scott brushed off questions about whether Obama was needed to help turn out Black voters who are key to Democrats' coalition of voters, saying his popularity spans racial lines.\n\n\"Black folks and white folks are inspired by his leadership. They're inspired by the way that he governed himself,\" said Scott, Virginia's first Black state House speaker.\n\nObama's campaign swing affirms how popular the 64-year-old remains among his party's base more than eight years removed from the White House. Yet it underscores Democrats' lack of current top leaders and surrogates, with Republicans holding all levers of federal power and a cadre of Democratic governors and lawmakers vying for status as national figures.\n\nAnd, Scott's protests aside, the visit highlights pressure on Democrats to maximize their diverse coalition after Trump chipped away in 2024 at Democrats' usual advantages among Black and Hispanic voters. Trump lost Virginia and New Jersey but narrowed the margins in both states from his 2020 loss to Democrat Joe Biden. Republicans believe New Jersey, especially, is ripe to continue that trend for Ciattarelli.\n\nTrump endorsed Ciattarelli and has said -- without naming Earle-Sears -- that he backs the GOP candidate for Virginia governor. The president conducted a phone rally for Ciattarelli. He has not campaigned in person for either nominee, despite traveling multiple times in recent months to his golfing resort in New Jersey.\n\nThat reflects the tightrope Republicans must walk: Trump remains intensely popular among the most conservative voters but has a more precarious standing with the rest of the electorate.\n\nSpanberger and Sherrill have tried to capitalize.\n\n\"Jack won't say one bad word about the president,\" Sherrill charged in a debate with Ciattarelli.\n\nCiattarelli countered that \"no matter who sits in the White House, my job is to stand up for the 9.3 million citizens of the state, and I will.\" He then played up his Trump ties. \"It's best to have a relationship with whoever occupies the White House,\" he said.\n\nEarle-Sears aligns herself with the president, and according to AdImpact data, Spanberger's biggest advertising investment has gone to spots that try to tie Earle-Sears to Trump.\n\nThe lieutenant governor will lead GOP turnout rallies Saturday in Republican-rich small towns, first in Abingdon in the southwest corner of Virginia, then in Purceville, in the state's northernmost reaches near the Pennsylvania border.\n\nCiattarelli has stops in Woodbridge, Westfield and Fairfield, an itinerary that puts him in the exurbs of Newark, then across the state in a considerably less densely populated, more Republican swath.\n\nSpanberger and Sherrill, both center-left Democrats who helped the party retake the U.S. House in the 2018 midterms during Trump's first term, have emphasized economic arguments.\n\nThey've pledged to tackle rising consumer costs and blasted Trump for failing to reduce prices as he promised in the 2024 campaign. In New Jersey, however, Ciattarelli has blamed Democrats for higher energy costs because outgoing Gov. Phil Murphy has been leading the state for two terms.\n\nThe Democratic candidates have blasted the Republicans' federal domestic policy and tax cut bill. In Virginia, Spanberger has highlighted Trump's Department of Government Efficiency and, to a lesser degree, the ongoing federal shutdown -- both of which have a disproportionate impact in a state that has more than 300,000 federal employees, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\nEarle-Sears has tried to pin the shutdown on Spanberger, arguing the former congresswoman should use her leverage with Virginia's Democratic U.S. senators. Both senators have voted against the GOP's spending extension bill as Democrats demand Republicans address looming health care cuts.\n\nAdditionally, the contests could offer some clues as to whether social issues carry any less weight with voters than in previous elections. Spanberger and Sherrill herald their support for abortion rights, Spanberger doing so in the last Southern state to make the procedure widely accessible. Earle-Sears counters with a focus on transgender policies, trying to frame Spanberger as out of step with mainstream voters in the same way Trump used the issue against Democrat Kamala Harris in 2024.\n\nWhile results in Virginia and New Jersey will be mere guideposts for the 2026 midterms, California stands to have the most immediate impact on the national landscape.\n\nVoters there are deciding whether to override a nonpartisan redistricting commission and approve a new congressional map that is intended to send five more Democrats to Washington.\n\nIt's a direct counter to neutralize Texas' plan, already approved, that was drawn to tilt five seats in that state to the Republican column. And more states have followed suit, putting the national map itself in flux in an unprecedented mid-decade scramble years after the usual post-census redistricting process.\n\nRepublicans began the current Congress with just a 220-215 advantage in the House. That means just a few seats could determine whether Trump enjoys outright GOP control in Washington for the duration of his presidency or faces a new Democratic majority that, if patterned after his first term, blocks his agenda, opens an investigation of his administration and considers articles of impeachment.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/obama-rally-democrats-virginia-new-jersey-weekend-campaign-127082414"}

Before joining the business and finance vertical, she worked at \"60 Minutes,\" CBSNews.com and CBS News 24/7 as part of the CBS News Associate Program.\n\nThe prolonged U.S. government shutdown is putting millions of Americans at risk of missing their November food stamp benefits, a vital lifeline for low-income households.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, said in a memo Sunday that no benefits will be issued on Nov. 1, leaving the program's roughly 42 million beneficiaries uncertain about how they'll pay for groceries next month.\n\nSNAP recipients receive an average of $187 a month on a prepaid card, and many families rely on those benefits as their main source of money for food. Many of those registered with the program are asking if they will still be able to use the remaining dollars on their cards once funding is suspended and if they'll receive their November benefits retroactively, should lawmakers reach a deal to reopen the government.\n\nA stoppage in SNAP payments on Nov. 1 isn't guaranteed. Two federal judges in Massachusetts and Rhode Island ruled on Friday, Oct. 31, that the Trump administration is required by law to use contingency funds to pay at least partial SNAP benefits.\n\nThe government must respond by Monday on whether it plans to allocate money to continue payments.\n\nWith just days to go before a potential suspension in SNAP funding, here's what to know.\n\nWhile SNAP benefits will not be disbursed as scheduled in November, program recipients can use existing funds on their EBT cards to make purchases. If someone enrolled in the program hasn't spent all their October EBT dollars, for example, those benefits would roll over into November.\n\nSome states are advising recipients to use their remaining food stamps wisely, given the stalemate over funding the federal government.\n\n\"If you have remaining balances from previous months, we encourage you to plan your shopping carefully and purchase essential food items when needed,\" Hawaii's Department of Human Services said on its website.\n\nThe USDA hasn't indicated whether SNAP benefits would be paid retroactively once the government shutdown ends.\n\nBut social service experts who spoke with CBS News said they expect the USDA to pay the delayed November benefits once federal funding resumes.\n\n\"It is our understanding that SNAP benefits will be issued retroactively when the shutdown ends,\" said Lizbeth Ginsburg, a managing attorney in the welfare law unit at Greater Boston Legal Services.\n\nFederal rules governing the food-stamp program stipulate that SNAP recipients are entitled to their benefits, and that they should receive them if there's a disruption, said Gina Plata-Nino, interim SNAP director at the Food Research & Action Center (FRAC), a nonprofit group focused on ending hunger.\n\n\"That's why many state agencies have done a very good job of saying, 'Your benefits will be delayed,' versus, 'You are not getting benefits,'\" she told CBS News.\n\nWhile SNAP is federally funded and overseen by the USDA, each state is responsible for administering the program to its residents.\n\nSome states are taking action, with Democratic lawmakers urging Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins to tap into an estimated $5 billion in contingency funds to cover SNAP benefits next month. On Tuesday, a coalition of officials from 25 states and the District of Columbia sued the Trump administration over the suspension of benefits, arguing that it is unlawful. The lawsuit notes that this would mark the first delay in SNAP benefits in the program's history.\n\nIn recent days, several states have pledged to step in to ensure SNAP recipients can afford food in November. Their approaches vary, with some states promising to dispatch troops to support food banks, while others are allocating funds for general hunger relief.\n\nLouisiana Gov. Jeff Landry signed an emergency declaration on Oct. 24 intended to fund SNAP benefits for people who rely on the program, while Vermont lawmakers on Oct. 29 approved a plan to cover its residents' food stamp benefits through Nov. 15.\n\nOther states say they plan to ramp up support for local food banks by providing on-site personnel and additional funding. California Gov. Gavin Newsom said last week he would deploy National Guard troops to assist food bank operations and fast-track $80 million to keep the state's food banks stocked.\n\nIn New York, Gov. Kathy Hochul said she is providing $30 million in state funding to support 16 million meals. Roughly 3 million people in New York are on food stamps.\n\nOther states that have announced actions to help SNAP recipients include Connecticut, Hawaii, Iowa, Minnesota, New Hampshire, Nevada, New Mexico, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Virginia and Washington.\n\nOfficials in these states are stepping in despite the USDA saying states lack the authority to cover benefits and won't be reimbursed.\n\n\"There is no provision or allowance under current law for states to cover the cost of benefits and be reimbursed,\" the agency said in its memo.\n\nPlata-Nino said that puts states in a difficult position, given their already limited reserves. It also diverts attention and funding from other priorities, she added.\n\n\"These are resources that could have gone to other places,\" she said.", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/losangeles/news/food-stamps-snap-benefits-november-2025-government-shutdown/"}

He has not appeared in person in any of the major states hosting elections, like New Jersey or California, to pump up his party's candidate or cause. In Virginia, where a weak Republican candidate for governor is lagging behind an impervious-looking Democrat, he's offered only a tepid endorsement late in the campaign.\n\n(This has not, of course, stopped Democrats from talking about him, either in California, where they are fighting to pass a ballot measure that could give them five more safe House seats, or anywhere else.)\n\nNone of this is unusual for a president in an off-year. But the contests -- particularly the governor's races in New Jersey and Virginia -- are essentially the opening salvos of the midterm elections. And even if Trump has relatively little to say about them, the results will offer signals about his political strength and his party's strength more broadly, as it considers ways to keep his supporters in the fold when he is barred from once again topping the ticket.\n\n\"Will those Trump voters become Republican voters?\" asked Mike DuHaime, a Republican strategist who worked on Chris Christie's successful off-year campaigns for New Jersey governor in 2009 and 2013. \"Do they think any other race, other than presidential, is important enough to come out for?\"\n\nHere are three story lines that show how even elections that aren't directly about Trump can't help but be a little Trumpy.\n\nCan a candidate win a blue state by sounding like Trump?\n\nWhen Jack Ciattarelli, a former state lawmaker and a Republican, first ran for governor of New Jersey in 2017, he cut a wonky profile and occasionally criticized Trump, who he knew repulsed swing voters.\n\nFast forward eight years -- and a second unsuccessful run for governor in 2021 -- and you have a candidate who has fundamentally shifted his approach, my colleague Nick Corasaniti wrote in a perceptive profile. Ciattarelli doesn't talk so much about Trump. But he talks like him, decrying \"open borders\" and appearing with vaccine skeptics and far-right Trump-backers like Jack Posobiec. Nick wrote:\n\nSuch an approach amounts to a bet not yet tested in a competitive election since Mr. Trump's return to power last year: that the margins in a close race can be made up by tacking closer to the Republican base in a general election, and that Trump supporters will turn out even without Mr. Trump atop the ticket.\n\nIt's a departure from the timeworn tactic of playing to the middle, and if it works in a blue state, it will say a lot about the staying power of Trump's political style.\n\nWill Trump's 2024 coalition stick around?\n\nCiattarelli's decision to tack so close to Trump reflects the president's performance there in 2024, when he lost to former Vice President Kamala Harris by less than six percentage points, but showed remarkable strength in the state's most diverse areas. Every single majority-Hispanic township in the state swung Trump's way between 2020 and 2024, by 25 percentage points on average.\n\nThat, Shane Goldmacher and Christine Zhang wrote, makes Tuesday's results in New Jersey an early test of whether that movement was \"evidence of a durable political and racial realignment or a passing phenomenon specific to Mr. Trump.\"\n\n\"New Jersey ends up being the first meaningful temperature check since the last election,\" said Carlos Odio, a Democratic pollster who specializes in studying Latino voting patterns and lives in New Jersey.\n\nCiattarelli appears to understand precisely what's at stake, campaigning frequently in Black and Latino areas that were once considered safe Democratic turf.\n\nWhat about the one race Trump can't quite quit?\n\nThere is no chance that a Republican is going to win New York City's mayor's race. But that hasn't kept Trump entirely away from the contest to govern his hometown.\n\nHe mulled getting involved to stop Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee, from winning. He spoke directly with former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, the Democrat and former Trump foil now running as an independent, about the race. His advisers discussed giving Mayor Eric Adams, the embattled Democratic incumbent, an administration job in exchange for dropping out (Adams eventually did drop out, sans job offer).\n\nNone of that has stopped the rise of Mamdani, a democratic socialist, but Trump has tried one more tactic: threatening the city with major cuts to federal funding if Mamdani is elected.\n\nTrump seems unlikely to change the outcome of the race. But the question for New York is how, if Mamdani is elected, the president might flex his power to shape the city itself.\n\nPOSTCARD FROM SACRAMENTO\n\n... and what Tuesday means for Gavin Newsom\n\nPolls suggest that California voters are likely to pass Gov. Gavin Newsom's redistricting measure on Tuesday, a win that could help Democrats flip five House seats next year -- and that could pay political dividends for Newsom, too. My colleague Laurel Rosenhall, who covers California government, explains.\n\nThe ballot measure was framed as a way to fight President Trump's mid-decade redistricting push with fire. But it could also serve as a foundation for a 2028 presidential campaign for Newsom himself.\n\nOver the course of the campaign, Newsom expanded a national list of supporters that helped him raise an astonishing $114 million in less than three months. The haul from small donations is especially notable, with $38 million from people across the country who responded to email and text message appeals.\n\nTheir contact information is on a list Newsom has been methodically building since his earliest days in politics. More than 25 years ago, as a member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, Newsom began collecting emails for a bond measure to fund San Francisco parks. Since then, he told me he's been disciplined about expanding and maintaining the list that he calls \"the most valuable asset\" of his political career.\n\nNewsom leveraged that asset to turn a state level redistricting measure into an attention-grabbing national campaign. And that's a platform he can draw on again in 2028, if he wants to.\n\nMore on redistricting\n\n* Proponents for California's new redistricting measure say voters are motivated by stopping Trump.\n\n* The Virginia legislature took the first step to redrawing Congressional maps to benefit Democrats in 2026.\n\n* Ohio is now the latest Republican-led state to redraw its congressional map to benefit the G.O.P.\n\nQUOTE OF THE DAY\n\n\"Leader Thune's position on the importance of the legislative filibuster is unchanged.\"\n\nThat's what a spokesman for John Thune, the Senate majority leader, told my colleague Carl Hulse on Friday, shutting down a demand from President Trump to dispose of the filibuster in order to end the government shut down.\n\nOn Thursday, Trump took to Truth Social to call for Senate Republicans to \"go for what is called the Nuclear Option.\"\n\n\"Get rid of the Filibuster, and get rid of it, NOW!\" he wrote.\n\nThune has weakened the filibuster, but he and other Senior Republicans fear that getting rid of it entirely would spectacularly backfire if Democrats regained control of the Senate.\n\nMore on Senate Republicans:\n\n* Senators opposed the president's plan to import Argentine beef and voted three times this week to end his power to enforce sweeping tariffs, indicating growing Republican angst over Trump's trade agenda.\n\nThe Moment\n\nReady for a surprise\n\nIt was the end of President Trump's five-day visit to three countries in Asia -- a tour packed with extravagant welcome dinners, an aircraft rally and the gift of a replica gold crown -- and The New York Times's photographer Haiyun Jiang thought she was done for the day.\n\nShe had already photographed Trump and Xi Jinping of China shaking hands, and watched them recede into the bilateral meeting the whole trip had built up to. She and the other photographers had been told they wouldn't see the two men together again.\n\nBut, about 90 minutes into Trump and Xi's meeting, the media was told that the plan had changed, and the two men were coming out once more -- together.

There was no election on th...", "content": "A small army of union canvassers fanned out across a Los Angeles neighborhood, clad in purple and ready for a challenge.\n\nFour months ago, none of them expected to be here. There was no election on the calendar, and redistricting was something that happened near the start of each decade in California. But here they were, trying to convince voters to support an esoteric measure that was placed on the ballot in August and aimed at redrawing California's congressional maps.\n\nThey turned to a simple pitch: This is your chance to fight back against President Trump.\n\nIt wasn't a hard sell.\n\nCalifornia voters are well aware of the role their state is playing in the national redistricting war that began this summer when Mr. Trump asked Texas Republicans to deliver five more seats through gerrymandering.\n\nOrdinarily, campaigns struggle to energize voters for an off-year special election like this one in California. But as the union canvassers found, Democrats here see Proposition 50 as the latest referendum on Mr. Trump, who remains deeply unpopular in the state. If it passes, the measure could help Democrats oust as many as five Republican House members next year in California.\n\nFour days before the election, Democrats are feeling unusually confident in California. Polls show the measure passing by a healthy margin. Trailing in fund-raising by a wide amount, Republicans have all but abandoned the airwaves while Democrats are running ads that feel like something of a victory lap, featuring a who's who of national party leaders, including former President Barack Obama and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom, who championed Proposition 50, has raised at least $114 million, roughly double what Republicans have accumulated. He has so much money that he asked small donors to stop giving more than a week before the election.\n\n\"We are fighting fire with fire,\" Mr. Newsom told union members in San Jose this month. \"We are fighting back. And we will win.\"\n\nRepublicans have tried to sell voters on the ideals of independent redistricting, emphasizing that Democrats are trying to manipulate the process by sidelining the state panel that determines the congressional map according to nonpartisan guidelines. And former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, who is no fan of Mr. Trump, has spoken out against Proposition 50. But their message has been complicated by the fact that Republicans in Texas and other states have pursued the same gerrymandering efforts and turned their nuclear redistricting key first.\n\nAnd Democrats still find that one message resonates above all others. \"STOP TRUMP,\" urged the campaign literature distributed by Service Employees International Union canvassers.\n\nIn the working-class Latino neighborhood of Pico-Union in Los Angeles, residents said they were angry that Mr. Trump was targeting Latino people for deportation.\n\n\"We're not letting him win,\" said Jennye Roman, 49, who told the canvassers that she was eager to vote for Proposition 50. \"We're tired of him stepping all over our families. These are our people.\"\n\nThe door-knockers showed up ready to inform and persuade, aware that the average person might not be closely following headlines or steeped in the minutiae of midterm elections. But nearly everyone they encountered on an overcast October morning said they were at least somewhat aware of the ballot measure -- and ready to vote for it.\n\nAmong those knocking on doors was David Huerta, the California president of S.E.I.U. He was arrested in June during a protest in Los Angeles against Mr. Trump's immigration raids, a day before the president ordered National Guard troops to the city.\n\nHe said that voters in Los Angeles seemed to be paying closer attention to this election than they did to last year's presidential race.\n\n\"This community's suffered as a result of the federal operations that have happened,\" Mr. Huerta said. \"So they get it.\"\n\nOf course, the door-knockers were on friendly terrain, walking past old \"Bernie 2020\" signs still sitting in windows. Elsewhere in California, Republicans were frustrated that Democrats were trying to eliminate what little representation they had left in the state.\n\nDemocrats hold 43 House seats, compared with nine for Republicans in California. Proposition 50 could help Democrats win as many as five more, partly by splitting up Republican districts in Northern California and combining them with liberal areas like Marin County and Sonoma County.\n\nRyan Schohr, a rice and walnut farmer in Butte County, a rural region north of Sacramento, said he was happy with Representative Doug LaMalfa, the Republican who currently represents the area and is a rice farmer himself.\n\nBut under Proposition 50, Mr. Schohr's district would lose some conservative areas and add Democratic voters in Sonoma County near the coast.\n\nMr. Schohr, 48, said he feared the changes would result in farmers like himself being represented by someone living far away, without an understanding or concern for rural issues.\n\n\"I think that a Republican represents this area's interests much better than a Bay Area person can,\" Mr. Schohr said.\n\nWhile polls show a solid lead for Proposition 50, it can be difficult to predict turnout in an off-year special election. Opponents of the measure said they remained optimistic, even though they were being vastly outspent on the airwaves and had fewer volunteers on the ground.\n\n\"We're continuing to turn out supporters and educate persuadable voters, obviously knowing we're being outspent two to one,\" said Amy Thoma Tan, a spokeswoman for an opposition group funded by Charles Munger Jr., a wealthy Republican who has long supported independent redistricting. \"We're definitely still running through the finish line.\"\n\nStill, Republicans have already begun pointing fingers, criticizing Kevin McCarthy, the former House speaker who led one of the opposition campaigns, for not raising enough money. Compared with the Yes on 50 campaign's anti-Trump message, the opposition effort felt disjointed, ranging from taking shots at Mr. Newsom to praising the fairness of the current independent mapmaking panel.\n\nThe No on 50 groups have been outspent on television, $90 million to $34 million, according to the tracking firm AdImpact, and the disparity grew even more extreme during the crucial final month when Californians were filling out their mail ballots. After an initial ad binge in September, Mr. Munger's committee has spent less than $6,000 on TV ads this month.\n\nCalifornia Democrats have planned a series of campaign events for the final weekend before Tuesday's election, designed to motivate volunteers and generate coverage on local television stations. Union members across the state are planning to make phone calls and knock on doors.\n\nEarlier this month, Representative Hakeem Jeffries, the House minority leader, and Ken Martin, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, each visited Los Angeles to support Proposition 50. Mr. Martin called it \"a really critical priority\" for Democrats nationally.\n\nNational Republicans have not responded in kind. House leadership has given money to the California Republican Party, but party leaders have been far less vocal on Proposition 50. Mr. Trump has scarcely weighed in, criticizing early voting and mail-in ballot options in a Truth Social post this month, but not the measure itself.\n\nThat has left embattled Republican House members in California as the face of the opposition.\n\nRepresentative Kevin Kiley, a Republican whose Sacramento district would see an infusion of Democratic neighborhoods under the new map, has called for a nationwide ban on all mid-decade redistricting because, he has said, Americans oppose the gerrymander war between states. The idea has gone nowhere.\n\nStill, Mr. Kiley said he was encouraged that polling showed California voters still supported independent redistricting in concept, even as they also backed Proposition 50.\n\n\"At least that part of it is heartening to me: that despite the barrage of messaging convincing Californians that gerrymandering is somehow good for our state, people are not persuaded by that message,\" he said.\n\nNational Republicans may have concluded that the fight in California was costly and close to unwinnable, and that it was better to focus on convincing other states to redraw their maps instead, some strategists said. Even if California neutralizes the Texas gerrymander, Mr. Trump has convinced other Republican-led states, like North Carolina and Missouri, to follow suit.\n\n\"It could be that they decided that they're going to pick up so many seats in red states that it wasn't necessary,\" said Duane Dichiara, a Republican political consultant in California who is unaffiliated with the Proposition 50 fight. \"Plus, all these California seats are so expensive to defend.\"", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/31/us/politics/california-redistricting-proposition-50-trump.html"}

If there was any doubt about the tech giants' business strategy to spend heavily, this week's earning reports suggest it will continue apace -- at least for now. We drill into the numbers below.\n\nWe're also assessing what's missing from the trade truce between the U.S. and China, and the last-minute surge in money from New York's business community to back Andrew Cuomo in next week's mayoral election. We also speak with Oura's C.E.O. about how he's using A.I.\n\nAmazon calms the market\n\nThe artificial intelligence rally is storming back on Friday on renewed hopes that Big Tech's gigantic investments in A.I. are paying off.\n\nThe focus is on Apple and Amazon, whose strong quarterly results Thursday are propelling Nasdaq Composite Index futures higher.\n\nThe fortunes of both businesses are being closely watched, especially for what they say about how corporate America and consumers are faring amid President Trump's trade war. Amazon's bullish take on A.I. growth also calmed investors' nerves.\n\nLet's start there. Amazon shares, which have lagged the company's so-called Magnificent Seven peers all year, rose more than 12 percent in premarket trading. The e-commerce giant blew past Wall Street estimates, buoyed by growth in its consumer and cloud businesses.\n\nThe big takeaways:\n\n* Sales topped $180 billion last quarter, and its profit soared 38 percent, to $21.2 billion.\n\n* Revenues for the Amazon Web Services cloud business, a major profit driver, reached $33 billion for the quarter, up 20 percent from a year earlier. Andy Jassy, Amazon's C.E.O., said the division \"is growing at a pace we haven't seen since 2022.\"\n\n* The company spent more than $34 billion on capital expenditures last quarter. Amazon is on track to exceed $125 billion in capital exenditure investments for the year, mostly on data centers that power cloud computing and A.I.\n\n* Rufus, its shopping chatbot, is on pace to generate an additional $10 billion in sales this year, alleviating some doubts about the company's ability to monetize its A.I. investment.\n\nShares in Apple are also gaining. That is after the company gave an upbeat forecast for iPhone sales. It also notched $101.5 billion in revenues last quarter, a record, and a profit of $26.3 billion. On the downside, its China sales underwhelmed.\n\nInvestors have given Apple a pass so far on its more conservative A.I. strategy. That could change soon. \"They have to show they have a plan to move the needle for the next few years with A.I.,\" Thomas Plumb, president of Wisconsin Capital Management, told The Times.\n\nStill, investors are feeling more optimistic. On Thursday, Meta shares plunged after the company reported lackluster quarterly results and rising costs. The company is committing billions -- and reportedly plans to borrow billions more -- to build data centers to power its A.I. ambitions. It's part of a group of high-spending tech companies known as the hyperscalers, which are forecast to spend roughly $2.8 trillion in A.I.-related infrastructure investment through 2029, according to analysts at Citigroup.\n\nHERE'S WHAT'S HAPPENING\n\nThe Jeffrey Epstein ordeal continues to hit the rich and powerful. Weeks after the convicted sex offender died in 2019, JPMorgan Chase alerted the U.S. government to huge money flows that were potentially suspicious transactions involving Epstein and prominent Wall Street and business figures, The Times reports. Prince Andrew, a member of Britain's royal family, is also facing more blowback from his ties to the disgraced financier: Buckingham Palace announced that he would be stripped of his royal title and evicted from his sprawling residence.\n\nNetflix reportedly hires a bank to explore a bid for parts of Warner Bros. Discovery. The company has hired Moelis & Company, the investment bank that advised Skydance Media on a bid for Paramount, to evaluate its possible offer for Warner Bros. Discovery's Hollywood studio and streaming business, according to Reuters. Neither company commented on the report, but Netflix's C.E.O., Ted Sarandos, has said the streaming giant has no interest in Warner Bros. Discovery's cable TV networks.\n\nChina's factory production shows more signs of weakness. Manufacturing activity in China's factories fell again in October, making the slump the longest in more than nine years. The cut and delay in U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods announced after talks between President Trump and Xi Jinping, China's leader, offers manufacturers hope for a surge in orders, but China's economy will probably need more government stimulus to reverse the slowdown, analysts say.\n\nGrading the Trump-Xi talks\n\nInvestors and business leaders are still piecing through the framework trade truce hammered out by President Trump and Xi Jinping of China on Thursday.\n\nTrump hailed the talks as a victory, while China was more measured.\n\nA recap: China agreed to buy millions of tons of U.S. soybeans and ease its toughest export restrictions on rare-earth metals. Among the U.S. concessions, Washington agreed to remove thousands of Chinese firms from a so-called entity list that restricts their access to advanced technology.\n\nBut several omissions stand out, Grady McGregor reports.\n\nThe artificial intelligence chips question: Semiconductors came up in talks with Xi, Trump said on Thursday, but there was no clear resolution on the more burning question of Nvidia's future in China. The U.S. has long banned exports of the most advanced A.I. chips, including Nvidia's Blackwell processors, to Chinese companies on national security grounds. Beijing in turn has instructed local companies to rely on domestically produced chips.\n\nBefore the talks, Trump suggested he would ease the ban -- which Jensen Huang, Nvidia's C.E.O., has argued hampers American A.I. development -- helping to propel the company's shares to a $5 trillion market valuation. Trump has embraced Huang since the start of his second term, seeing Nvidia as key to the U.S. dominating the A.I. marketplace.\n\nBut in the end, Trump said he told Xi the matter was \"really between you and Nvidia, but we're sort of the arbitrator or the referee.\"\n\nAnd then there is the matter of America's overseas interests. Washington has been leaning on its allies to enforce its entity list and restrict Chinese firms from accessing advanced technology. They were probably blindsided to learn that the U.S. had agreed to suspend some of those restrictions for a year, analysts said.\n\n\"Any U.S. partner may be saying: You're writing into our trade deals that we need to align with you on export controls. At the same time, you just reversed a major export control move,\" Reva Goujon, a director at Rhodium Group, told DealBook.\n\nWhat's next? After a day digging through the details, analysts said the framework agreement was more of a temporary cease-fire than an endpoint in trade negotiations.\n\nOn the optimistic end, the trade truce will \"lend some momentum to future dialogues,\" Joe Mazur, a senior analyst at Trivium China, told DealBook. Others were not impressed. \"This is a microdeal,\" said Isaac Stone Fish, the C.E.O. of the business intelligence firm Strategy Risks. \"It will not last.\"\n\nBig Money's last-minute Cuomo push\n\nThere are just days to go until New York City's mayoral election, and Zohran Mamdani maintains a double-digit lead over Andrew Cuomo in the polls.\n\nBut some of Cuomo's backers, including Mike Bloomberg, are still throwing money behind Cuomo, New York's former governor, Lauren Hirsch writes.\n\nThe big question: Will it be enough to derail Mamdani, the democratic socialist whose policies around taxes and rent control, have rattled New York's business leaders?\n\n\"This election is very winnable for Andrew,\" the financiers Ricky Sandler, Richard Mack and Marty Burger wrote in a new email to donors, obtained by The Times. \"We need your help to close the gap!\"\n\nThey said they planned to use remaining funds in a super PAC backing Cuomo for get-out-the-vote efforts. One target: older voters in the Bronx and Staten Island.\n\nBloomberg has also moved off the sidelines. The former New York City mayor on Wednesday donated $1.5 million to a super PAC supporting Cuomo's bid. That's after he spent more than $8 million on Cuomo's failed bid to become the Democratic nominee. In September, as Mamdani became a clear front-runner in the polls, Bloomberg hosted him at his Midtown Manhattan headquarters.\n\nBut Bloomberg is all-in on Cuomo, saying he \"has the experience and toughness to stand up for New Yorkers and get things done.\"\n\nCuomo's camp has been buoyed by reports of robust early voting turnout among older voters. Polls show this group is more likely to support Cuomo, who's 67, than younger New Yorkers.\n\nBurger, Mack and Sandler question the accuracy of the forecasts showing Mamdani with such a large lead. \"We don't believe the polls have been a good indicator of what will happen in this election and the early voting data is confirming that view,\" they wrote in their latest email to donors.\n\nIs it too late? Polymarket, the prediction markets platform, on Friday gave Mamdani 95 percent odds of winning. And DealBook heard from one recipient of a pitch from the pro-Cuomo PAC who said he was on the fence about donating to Cuomo, thinking his money would not be enough to sway the outcome.\n\nTalking A.I. with the C.E.O. of Oura\n\nEvery week, we're asking a chief executive how he or she uses generative artificial intelligence. Tom Hale, who leads the wearable technology company Oura Health, told DealBook he often asks a chatbot to prompt him instead of the other way around. His answers have been condensed and edited.\n\nHow do you personally use A.I.?\n\nThe thing that I've found most valuable is a tactic that was described to me by Geoff Woods, who wrote \"The Ai-Driven Leader.\" You set a context, you give it a role. For example, I'm the C.E.O. of Oura, and you're Steve Jobs; then you say, \"Ask me 10 questions about this topic.\" After the interview, you say, \"Based on my answers, give me a task to do.\"\n\nIt was sort of a revelation because I was using it in this very typical way -- as a tool to do things and do them faster. This way, I'm not just prompting the A.I., the A.I. is prompting me.\n\nHave you given any directives to your companies or direct reports about what you want them to do with A.I.?\n\nIt's more carrot than stick. I want to see you show me you have the ideas and the passion and the desire to use these tools in an interesting and novel way.\n\nWe've hired a group of people to be a center of excellence, to make sure we're using the right tools and doing it with the right governance and respect for privacy. But it's not that you have to go to the A.I. department to get some A.I. The center of excellence is there to say, \"If you're not thinking about this, you should.\" Or, \"Here's a tool that we're providing.\"\n\nIt's \"let a thousand flowers bloom.\"\n\nTHE SPEED READ\n\nDeals\n\n* N.B.A. owners gave the go-ahead for Mark Walter, the billionaire investor, to buy the Los Angeles Lakers in a sale valuing the team at $10 billion.

States can also legally cover health insurance for illegal immigrants, so long as it is only done with state tax dollars. But, according to some experts, Democrats are utilizing loopholes in the federal laws that allow them to provide comprehensive health benefits to illegal immigrants.\n\n\"Protecting Medicaid from waste, fraud, and abuse isn't optional -- it's the law. Every dollar misspent on illegal health care spending is a dollar taken from vulnerable Americans,\" CMS spokesperson Emily Hilliard, told Fox News Digital. \"Federal law forbids using Medicaid funds for illegal immigrants, yet several Democrat-led states did it anyway. The Trump Administration won't tolerate it. CMS is auditing aggressively, recovering every dollar, and holding states accountable.\"\n\nDR. OZ ACCUSES DEMOCRATS OF 'GASLIGHTING' AMERICANS OVER $1B IN MEDICAID PAYMENTS TO ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS\n\nCalifornia was far-and-away the biggest culprit, which single-handedly spent over $1 billion in federal Medicaid dollars on healthcare for illegal immigrants, according to CMS. The next largest violator was Illinois, which CMS said has improperly spent nearly $30 million, followed by Oregon, which the audit found improperly spent approximately $5.5 million.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom's office has denied claims that his state is improperly using federal funds to pay for illegal immigrant healthcare, telling the Los Angeles Times that these claims from Republicans are \"false.\"\n\nBut, Steve Hilton, a former Fox News anchor and current Republican candidate running to be the next Governor of California after Newsom is term-limited out, has argued that California has been using a complex Medicaid provision known as a \"provider tax\" to obtain matching federal dollars, which then gets pooled into the money used by the state to pay for its healthcare offered to undocumented immigrants. Meanwhile, Chris Pope, a public health policy expert at the Manhattan Institute, has argued California is abusing federal provisions that allow states to use federal Medicaid dollars for emergency care for undocumented aliens.\n\nFox News Digital reached out to Newsom's office for comment on this story, but did not receive a response.\n\nCALIFORNIA USING BACK DOOR TO GET FEDERAL FUNDS FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT HEALTHCARE, GOP SAYS; DEMS SAY NONSENSE\n\n\"Medicaid is by far the largest source of federal funding for states. It was originally intended to only provide aid for eligible beneficiaries, but over time states have figured out how to game the system -- padding permitted expenses and diverting the profits to fund activities which are supposedly prohibited,\" said Pope. \"Any claim that state healthcare expenditures don't ultimately involve some form of federal funds should be regarded with suspicion.\"\n\nJim O'Neill, the current Acting Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and a Deputy Secretary at the Health and Human Services Department, has also been highlighting that among the federal funds that are improperly going to illegal immigrants, some are even going to illegal immigrants with violent criminal pasts. O'Neill has been posting a daily \"MorningMedicaidMugshot\" with examples over the last several days.\n\nOn Oct. 29, O'Neill highlighted Layth Kamil, a 24-year-old illegal alien from Iraq, convicted of exposing himself to a 15-year-old, who, according to O'Neill, has received close to $16,000 in taxpayer-funded healthcare through Medicaid. The day before, O'Neill highlighted the story of Haissam Massalkhy, a 45-year-old illegal alien from Lebanon, convicted after driving under the influence and killing an American citizen who was out jogging.

A school secretary in Las Vegas pitched in $50. An interior designer in Pennsylvania, an insurance agent in Chicago and a ski instructor in New Hampshire each gave $100.\n\nTheir small donations all went to California to help Gov. Gavin Newsom try to flip five congressional seats for Democrats.\n\n\"I'm so disenchanted with the direction of this country today that I have to support the people that are standing up for democracy,\" said Amy Kaufman, the ski instructor. \"And Gavin Newsom is one of them.\"\n\nResponding to email and text message appeals, small donors from across the country gave Mr. Newsom a combined $38 million for a ballot measure intended to stop President Trump and Republicans from retaining complete control of the federal government in 2026.\n\nNearly half of donors who cumulatively gave at least $100 came from outside of California. In multiple interviews, these donors said they gave to Mr. Newsom because they saw him as one of the few Democrats fighting Republicans on their own terms. After President Trump asked leaders in Texas and other red states to pursue rare, mid-decade gerrymandering to offset potential midterm losses for Republicans, California is the closest of any Democrat-led state to striking back so far.\n\nPolls suggest that California voters are very likely to pass Mr. Newsom's redistricting measure on Tuesday, a win that could serve as the ultimate foundation for a 2028 presidential run that he is considering. If he runs, he could tell voters that he directly fought back against Mr. Trump in the midterms.\n\nAnd he would emerge with a national list of donors and supporters that few other Democratic hopefuls have at the moment.\n\nThe list began more than 25 years ago, when Mr. Newsom was a wine entrepreneur just getting his footing as a politician. Mr. Newsom said in an interview that he started building an email list of donors when he was on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors and wanted to gather support for a bond measure to fund parks.\n\n\"I started going, 'Oh, emails, that's interesting and novel,\" he recalled. \"'I should use these.'\"\n\nFrom there, he took a methodical approach to building his list, gathering more names and emails every time he ran for another office or put an initiative on the ballot. The list includes names that Mr. Newsom has collected organically, as well as those in databases he has purchased.\n\nThe project accelerated in 2021 when Republicans tried to recall Mr. Newsom and he reached out to Democrats across the country for support. Then, in 2023, Mr. Newsom created a political action committee to support Democrats in Republican-controlled states -- giving him a reason to collect more names and emails from beyond California.\n\nBuilding the list had become a discipline. Mr. Newsom called the list \"huge\" but declined to say an exact number. He now calls the list \"the most valuable asset\" of his political career.\n\n\"It's a very deliberative investment,\" Mr. Newsom said. \"It's a lot of resources. It's a lot of time and a lot of iteration.\"\n\nAlong the way, Mr. Newsom picked up contact info for Steven Lamansky, a retired high school math teacher in Ankeny, Iowa, just north of Des Moines. Mr. Lamansky sent his first $35 donation to the Proposition 50 campaign on Aug. 10 after receiving a text message pitch from Mr. Newsom's campaign. Two weeks later, he sent another $35. The next month, $35 more.\n\nMr. Lamansky, 77, said he donated because he wanted to counter gerrymandering in Republican-led states and help Democrats to take back the House next year. But he also pitched in specifically to boost Mr. Newsom.\n\n\"I find him a very dynamic person,\" Mr. Lamansky said. \"Every time I've heard him on different shows, he's really got his ducks in a row. He knows his facts. I really like him, and I'd like to see him run for president.\"\n\nMr. Newsom has curated his national image, just as he has his supporter list. He has gone on Fox News to attack Republicans, including a face-off with Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida in 2023 that was billed as \"The Great Red vs. Blue State Debate.\" He started the podcast \"This Is Gavin Newsom\" this year, turning heads when he asked conservatives like Charlie Kirk and Steve Bannon why the Democrats failed in 2024.\n\nAfter Mr. Trump sent National Guard troops to Southern California in June during immigration raids and protests, Mr. Newsom returned to his place as a chief antagonist of the Republican president. One night, with troops in Los Angeles, he gave a speech on national television warning Americans that \"democracy is under assault right before our eyes.\"\n\nThis summer, Mr. Newsom used a more experimental communication strategy. With help from his young staff, Mr. Newsom adopted an aggressively satirical voice mocking Mr. Trump on social media. And he began appearing on platforms that cater to young, male audiences -- a cohort that Democrats lost ground with in last year's election.\n\nBetween banter about sports and video games, the governor has slipped in pleas for his redistricting measure into the \"All the Smoke\" podcast, which is hosted by two retired N.B.A. players, and a livestreamed game of Fortnite with a Twitch streamer known as ConnorEatsPants.\n\nRepublicans have struggled to counter Mr. Newsom on Proposition 50, in part because of the governor's fund-raising prowess, but also because he was so effective in making the race a referendum on Mr. Trump in a Democratic state. They lacked a central figure or message around which to build a groundswell of opposition.\n\nRepresentative Kevin Kiley, a California Republican who would become immediately vulnerable if Proposition 50 passes, has spent years challenging Mr. Newsom, including during the 2023 recall when he ran as a candidate for governor.\n\nMr. Kiley has been a lonely voice in Washington calling for a national prohibition on mid-decade redistricting. He said the ballot measure seemed to be serving as a \"launching pad\" for Mr. Newsom's 2028 aspirations.\n\n\"His entire governorship,\" Mr. Kiley said, \"he has treated as a warm-up to running for president.\"\n\nMr. Newsom's efforts have resonated with Democratic voters beyond California, as he has climbed to the top of several Democratic presidential primary polls in the months since he began the redistricting campaign.\n\nIt is, of course, too early to anoint any contender, let alone Mr. Newsom. The California governor could struggle in many states to overcome his reputation as a liberal coastal elite, an image that Democrats are desperately trying to shed at the moment.\n\nThough Mr. Newsom is getting a lot of traction with the Democratic activist base, it does not mean he will win a primary three years from now, said Mike Murphy, a former adviser to Republican presidential candidates who supported Joseph R. Biden Jr. in 2020 and Kamala Harris last year instead of Mr. Trump.\n\n\"He's got a flashy thing of the moment,\" Mr. Murphy said. \"In the 100 steps to the nomination, it doesn't hurt him. I just think you can overrate it.\"\n\nMatt Bennett, a Democratic strategist who worked on campaigns for former President Bill Clinton, said that Mr. Newsom may also have a hard time running a presidential campaign because of a perception nationally that California is a troubled state.\n\n\"What he can do is run on his aggressive efforts to take on Trump and MAGA in various ways,\" Mr. Bennett said, adding that the redistricting measure would be \"the most important and prominent of them.\"\n\nSteven Rich contributed data analysis, and Shane Goldmacher contributed reporting.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/30/us/newsom-california-proposition-50-presidential.html"}

Some governors are shifting state money to cover part of the shortfall, bolster food pantries or both.\n\nWith the federal government shut down and the Trump administration refusing to tap reserve funds, 42 million low-income Americans are expected to lose access on Nov. 1 to food assistance through the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program, or SNAP.\n\nMore than two dozen states led by Democratic governors and attorneys general have sued the administration, saying the cutoff of funding to the program, which provides around $187 a month to about one out of every eight people in the United States, is unnecessary and illegal.\n\nThe states have asked a federal judge to force the Agriculture Department to use billions of dollars in federal emergency funds to provide at least partial payments to enrollees in the program. Whether that happens remains to be seen.\n\nHere are some of the ways that states have been preparing for looming SNAP shutdown:\n\nEmergency funds\n\nMore than a dozen states -- most of them run by Democrats -- will be using their own funds to temporarily fill the gap, primarily by working with food banks.\n\nCalifornia is releasing $80 million to bolster food banks in the state. Connecticut is allocating $3 million for that purpose, and Minnesota $4 million. .\n\nOn Thursday, Illinois set aside $20 million -- $10 million from a new emergency reserve fund and $10 million from the state's Department of Human Services -- for seven food banks.\n\nIn Hawaii, Gov. Josh Green, a Democrat, is diverting a $100 million surplus from the federal Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program to help families with children pay their housing and utility bills, freeing up money in the family budget to be spent on food instead. About one-third of Hawaiians who receive SNAP benefits are in families with children.\n\nAnd in Vermont, the state's Republican governor, Phil Scott, and the Democratic-controlled legislature announced on Wednesday that the state would spend $6.3 million to fully fund SNAP benefits for two weeks. The state also approved sending $250,000 to the Vermont Foodbank.\n\nMissouri, a Republican-run state, is using a targeted approach. On Wednesday, Gov. Mike Kehoe authorized shifting $10.6 million from a senior services fund to a statewide network of nonprofit groups that would provide meals to seniors. Mr. Kehoe has also set aside $5 million in federal welfare funds for food banks.\n\nSome governors, however, have pointedly said that they won't use state funds to replace missing federal food aid, at a time when states are contending with a slowing economy, sweeping federal spending cuts and swirling uncertainties stemming from the president's trade and immigration policies.\n\nGov. Wes Moore of Maryland, a Democrat, stressed that SNAP was a federal program, and said that his state did not have the capacity to cover its cost. He also expressed doubt that his state would ever be reimbursed if it were to try.\n\nEmergency declarations\n\nOn Thursday, Gov. Kathy Hochul of New York became the latest state chief executive to declare a state of emergency as a mechanism to unlock more money for food assistance. Her commitment of $65 million means that the state has now authorized a total of $106 million in new funding for food banks and meal programs.\n\nTrump Administration: Live Updates\n\nUpdated\n\nOct. 30, 2025, 12:00 p.m. ET31 minutes ago\n\nGov. Glenn Youngkin of Virginia, a Republican, set the pace last week with his emergency declaration over SNAP funding, and said the state would use some of its budget surplus to create a new program, Virginia Emergency Nutrition Assistance, at a cost of $37.5 million a week.\n\nGov. Daniel McKee of Rhode Island, a Democrat, declared a state of emergency on Tuesday as a way of shifting $6 million from Temporary Assistance for Needy Families to families with children that are eligible for food stamps. Another $200,000 would go to the Rhode Island Community Food Bank.\n\nIn New Mexico, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, a Democrat, told reporters at an Albuquerque supermarket on Wednesday that her state would take similar steps.\n\nAbout 460,000 New Mexicans -- about 21 percent of the population, the highest rate in the country -- have been receiving SNAP benefits. The state plans to load a total of $30 million in state health funds -- which are separate from SNAP -- onto SNAP recipients' Electronic Benefits Transfer cards. That would mean that each recipient would be expected to receive about 30 percent of their usual food benefit in November.\n\nLouisiana took a slightly different approach. First, Gov. Jeff Landry, a Republican, declared a state of emergency on Oct. 24.\n\nThen on Wednesday, Mr. Landry said that the state would use $147 million from its health department's funds to pay for temporary food benefits in November for children, older residents and people with disabilities. Louisiana legislators expect the federal government to replenish the health funds when the shutdown ends -- though that's not guaranteed.\n\nIn Nevada, Gov. Joe Lombardo, a Republican, has authorized sending $38.8 million in state funds to food banks. But he has declined to declare a fiscal emergency, a step that would enable the state to access a reserve fund. Democratic legislators, who control both chambers of the state Legislature, have criticized his unwillingness to tap the reserve fund.\n\nGov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders of Arkansas, a Republican, said in an interview that her state would not be able either to set up a substitute food aid program or to call lawmakers in for a special session on the matter.\n\n\"Logistically, setting up a parallel food stamp program will be really difficult, given that the federal system is shut down,\" she said. Even so, she said, \"we'll continue to look at every option we have to take care of people in our state.\"\n\nGuard Deployments\n\nSome governors are dispatching National Guard troops or state volunteers to support distribution at food banks, which are expected to be overwhelmed with demand.\n\nIn California, Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, has authorized the National Guard and California Volunteers, the state's humanitarian aid agency, to support food banks, much the way they did during the height of the pandemic. About 30 National Guard troops were on hand at the Los Angeles Regional Food Bank last week to help pack meals and sort produce.\n\nGov. Henry McMaster of South Carolina, a Republican, has asked the State Guard, a volunteer organization that is separate from the South Carolina National Guard, to help food pantries with distribution, traffic and other functions.\n\nPrivate appeals\n\nSouth Carolina is also one of a number of states that are encouraging more private donations to food banks. Mr. McMaster has activated the One SC Fund, which functions as South Carolina's coordinated philanthropic response to disasters. It was established in 2015 after Hurricane Joaquin, and has been activated following Hurricanes Matthew, Florence, and Helene, as well as the pandemic.\n\nColorado has launched a new philanthropic initiative urging individuals and businesses to help with food assistance through Feeding Colorado, an association of five food banks in the state. The state has posted an interactive map to highlight where SNAP recipients live.\n\nGov. Jared Polis, a Democrat, has also asked the legislature to approve spending up to $10 million to support food pantries.\n\nEmily Cochrane and Eduardo Medina contributed reporting.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/30/us/politics/snap-states.html"}

The U.S. Department of Agriculture, which runs the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, warned earlier this month that there would be insufficient funding to pay full November benefits if the shutdown continued.\n\nAbout 42 million Americans rely on food stamps, including 5.5 million in California. A little more than 23% of Barstow's population lives below the poverty line, above the state average of 17.7% and nearly double the national average of 12.4%\n\n\"We understand that these circumstances may cause additional stress for many families,\" the Barstow Police Department posted on Facebook. To help ensure the safety of residents, customers, and business owners, officers will be conducting extra patrols around local grocery stores, convenience stores, and shopping centers.\"\n\nBarstow PD said the move is \"a preventative measure to maintain public safety, deter theft, and reassure the community that law enforcement is present and ready to help.\"\n\nLast week, California Gov. Gavin Newsom deployed the state's National Guard to help staff food banks, which are preparing for a surge in demand similar to pandemic levels.\n\n\"We're really worried about kind of the overall demand and need,\" said Michael Flood, President and CEO of the Los Angeles Regional Food Bank. \"We're also going to be working on what we did during the pandemic, organizing larger distributions. Often, these are drive-thru distributions where we can serve thousands of households within a few hours.\"\n\nThere were signs of progress on ending the government shutdown for the first time in weeks on Wednesday, with senators expressing cautious optimism about bipartisan talks aimed at resolving the impasse. Half of the states, including California, sued the Trump administration over the suspension of food stamp benefits, in hopes that a federal judge will order the USDA to use contingency funds to ensure SNAP continues.\n\n\"We didn't think we'd be here,\" Flood said. \"Our hope is that there is a resolution back in DC.

Gavin Newsom (D) has made President Donald Trump the chief adversary in efforts to pass a redistricting plan in his state. (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)\n\nLOS ANGELES -- When a pair of Democratic door knockers asked Reid Pelsue on a recent Saturday whether he was familiar with an upcoming high-stakes special election, he told them he had no idea what they were talking about.\n\nBut when they said they were pushing a ballot measure to fight what they called President Donald Trump's \"power grab,\" by enabling Democrats to redraw the state's congressional map and add as many as five more seats to offset what Republicans were doing outside California, he was sold.\n\n\"It just hurts,\" Pelsue, 23, said of Trump's second term, citing the administration's immigration crackdown and voicing concern about the president's mid-decade redistricting push. Shooing his cats back inside, Pelsue went to grab his phone so the organizers could guide him to a website where he could request a ballot and find polling locations.\n\nAs California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) and his allies try to nudge their plan across the finish line in Tuesday's election, they are focusing squarely on Trump, running television commercials, digital ads and an aggressive canvassing operation that holds up the president as their chief adversary. Their bet, placed months ago before they had even launched the campaign, is that anger with Trump in a deep-blue state will motivate people to vote yes on Proposition 50 and simplify an appeal some initially worried could become muddled in the arcana of redistricting.\n\nThe strategy appears to be paying dividends as the campaign nears its conclusion, fueling a stark fundraising advantage and edge in the polls that Democrats hope will help deliver a concrete rebuttal to Trump's political agenda less than a year into his second term. Proponents of Prop 50, which include of a constellation of committees led by one Newsom is helming, outraised the opposing side by a wide margin through Oct. 18, campaign finance data show. At a critical juncture earlier this month when many voters had received their mailed ballots, two of the main committees urging Californians to vote no went dark on broadcast and satellite television, according to data from AdImpact, the latest indicator of an opposition campaign that has sputtered.\n\nThe fundraising imbalance had tipped so far in favor of advocates of the ballot measure this week that Newsom sent a fundraising message Monday telling supporters they could \"stop donating.\" \"We have hit our budget goals and raised what we need in order to pass Proposition 50,\" the Democratic governor wrote. \"Now it's about executing the plan. If we can do that, we're going to win.\" (On Tuesday, Newsom sent out a fundraising solicitation asking for $3 to fight GOP redistricting moves in Indiana).\n\nThe election in California, one of several states casting ballots on Nov. 4, will provide a measure of the potency of Democrats' frequently used anti-Trump message in a setting where it has not been tested: An off-year election in the country's most populous state, with no candidates on the ballot. While Newsom and his allies are sounding confident notes, observers cautioned that since the election is unlike most others in recent memory, a surprise outcome is possible.\n\nA Public Policy Institute of California poll showed that 56 percent of likely California voters said they will vote yes on Prop 50, while 43 percent said they will vote no. A CBS News survey showed a 62 percent to 38 percent spread.\n\nNewsom and his allies released a closing ad this week that tells viewers they can \"stand up to Donald Trump.\" It features former president Barack Obama and other prominent Democrats, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-New York).\n\nTrump has avoided getting directly or publicly involved in campaign activities involving the California ballot measure. But he recently sought, without evidence, to discredit the vote in a Truth Social post. Trump has also repeatedly insulted Newsom's competence as governor. Newsom has trolled the president with mocking posts on his own social media. The White House did not respond to a request for comment for this story.\n\nNewsom, who initially tried to collaborate with Trump after he was elected, pivoted to a sharply adversarial posture after Trump sent military troops into Los Angeles this summer in the midst of immigration protests -- before making Trump his chief foil in the redistricting campaign.\n\n\"Fear and anger are very powerful forces in politics -- and it's the Democrats that are fearful and angry,\" said California Republican strategist Kevin Spillane.\n\nCalifornia Democrats have pointed frequently to the outsize impact of Trump's tactics on their state -- from his administration's immigration raids, to his deployment of federal troops in Los Angeles, to the slashing of key education and research grants for California institutions. Underpinning those figures are the low approval ratings for Trump and his actions in California. The PPIC poll showed that just 26 percent of Californians approve of the way Trump is handling his job. Large majorities of Californians disapprove of the job that Immigration and Customs Enforcement is doing (71 percent) and the tariffs the U.S. has placed on imports (72 percent).\n\nOpponents of Newsom's plan have used an array of tactics aimed at different parts of the electorate, ranging from ads suggesting it would destroy the state's independent redistricting process to events where they have argued the new maps would break up Asian American communities and dilute the power of rural constituencies. In one ad, they also featured comments from former California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger (R) arguing for keeping the independent redistricting system he helped create and stating that Prop 50 would \"take us backwards.\" Privately, many Republicans in the state have been critical of what they viewed as a scattered unfocused message from the \"no\" side.\n\nJessica Millan Patterson, the chair of No on 50 -- Stop Sacramento's Power Grab, one of the committees opposing Newsom's ballot measure, said in a recent interview that her group believes the vote will be close and credited Trump's team for helping with turnout efforts. She argued that their message that \"the power is being taken away from the people\" with Newsom's ballot measure resonates with many independent voters. The committee is backed by former House speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-California).\n\n\"We always knew this was going to be an uphill battle for us,\" she said. \"We are making sure that we are targeting specific individuals that are persuadable in these last few days.\"\n\nThe Congressonal Leadership Fund, which is aligned with House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-Louisiana), gave money to the committee as well as the state GOP, while Charles Munger Jr. -- the Stanford physicist and Berkshire Hathaway heir who helped finance the original ballot measures creating the state's independent process -- funded a different committee opposing the measure with nearly $33 million.\n\nBut some of the money that opponents of the measure hoped would materialize has not arrived -- all while the opposition has raised money at a brisk pace. Newsom's ballot committee raised $114 million through the period ending on Oct. 18, while the McCarthy-aligned No on Prop 50 -- Stop Sacramento's Power Grab and the Munger-aligned No on Prop 50 -- Protect Voters First, raised $43.7 million over that same period.\n\n\"While we are being significantly outspent, there are still millions of votes to be submitted, and the campaign will focus on communicating to persuadable voters and turning out supporters,\" said Amy Thoma Tan, a spokeswoman for the Munger-aligned committee who declined to discuss the campaign's fundraising strategy.\n\nAbout a fifth of the 23 million ballots sent out had been returned as of Tuesday, according to Political Data Incorporated, which supplies data to Democratic groups and campaigns, and of those ballots, more than half were from Democrats.\n\n\"Nine days before the election, ballots are coming in at a faster pace than they were in the 2024 general election,\" said Paul Mitchell, vice president at PDI. He said that is in part because there is only one question on the ballot.\n\nNewsom worked with members of Congress and the California legislature to get the Democratic-leaning maps on the November ballot once it became clear that Texas lawmakers were going to approve maps creating five new GOP-leaning seats at Trump's behest. They pitched the measure as a direct response to Trump -- a temporary patch that would put the new maps in place for 2026, 2028 and 2030, before allowing the state's independent commission to resume its work drawing lines.\n\nNewsom's ballot measure offered donors and voters a chance to deliver a tangible blow to Trump's agenda. The money quickly started pouring in and the enormous war chest allowed Newsom's ballot committee to flood the airwaves and digital media with ads. \"Wake up America,\" Newsom said in one ad, accusing Trump of trying to \"rig the system\" and warning that democracy would disappear district by district.\n\nThe most widely circulated ad of the yes campaign featured Obama, a onetime critic of partisan gerrymandering. He accused the GOP of trying to \"steal enough seats in Congress to rig the next election\" and give Trump \"unchecked power for two more years.\" Prop 50, the former president argued, \"levels the playing field.\"\n\nIn these final days, Democrats have urged voters not to get complacent. At the doors she has knocked on in Cheviot Hills and Long Beach, including Pelsue's, Anissa Raja has repeatedly described the ballot question to voters as an \"emergency measure.\"\n\n\"This is for all the folks who want to get involved,\" said Raja, who heads the Los Angeles County Young Democrats, as she walked doors with her script. \"You want to figure out how to fight back? Yeah, it's by voting.\"", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/10/30/newsom-trump-redistricting-california-election/"}

Love, Rahm.\" Or the celebratory dinner in Little Rock, Arkansas, after Bill Clinton's 1992 victory, when Emanuel repeatedly stabbed the table with a steak knife as he named those who'd betrayed the campaign and decreed them, one after the other, \"Dead! Dead! Dead!\" Or the nameplate on his desk in the White House, when he was Barack Obama's first chief of staff: Undersecretary for Go Fuck Yourself, a gift from his two brothers -- Zeke, a prominent bioethicist, and Ari, a Hollywood superagent. (The nameplate was short-lived; Michelle Obama didn't like it.)\n\nBut this profile, Emanuel informed me, will not be one of those profiles.\n\n\"One: Distinguish the caricature from the character,\" he told me, reading from a scrap of paper with a short list of what I must understand about him. \"I get all the caricature -- I played into it or whatever -- but there's principle behind it. I don't just fight for the sport of fight.\"\n\nI had arrived a few minutes early for our 8 a.m. breakfast at the Park Hyatt in Washington, D.C., but Emanuel, who hates being late, was already seated in his crisp white button-down and dark-blue jeans. He'd begun his day at 5:30 a.m. with 50 minutes on the hotel's stationary bike, 20 minutes of weights, and now nearly seven minutes of instructing me on how to properly do my job.\n\nOver black coffee and Greek yogurt with berries, he continued outlining what should be in my profile: He had helped vanquish many a Republican -- particularly as chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee during the 2006 midterms -- but Republicans still like him. As proof, he pulled up recent emails from two congressional Republicans, both committee chairmen, praising his potential 2028 bid. He would later show me another, from a Republican senator, complimenting his stint as ambassador to Japan. (Emanuel seemed to think that these private niceties forecast a broad appeal with voters.) He also noted that unaffiliated voters can cast ballots in the Democratic primary in New Hampshire, which could be the first state to pass judgment in 2028.\n\nFinally, Emanuel ran through the ways in which he had been ahead of the rest of the country as mayor of Chicago, from 2011 to 2019. Under his leadership, he said, Chicago was among the first U.S. cities to sue pharmaceutical companies over opioids. It was a pioneer in universal prekindergarten and free community college. He made Chicago a top destination for corporate relocation, and traveled to Europe and Asia to drum up foreign investment in the city. And he devoted his second mayoral inaugural address, in 2015, to the plight of \"lost and unconnected young men,\" well before it became the topic du jour.\n\nAlthough Emanuel says that he will not make a decision on running until next year, he is publicly and privately gearing up for a presidential campaign. You may have seen and heard more of Emanuel these past few months than you ever did when he was in elected or appointed office. He was on Megyn Kelly's show, where he broke with progressives over transgender issues (\"Can a man become a woman? ... No.\"). While testifying before a House committee on China, Emanuel said that, as Joe Biden's ambassador to Japan, he strengthened ties among Tokyo, Washington, Manila, and Seoul, as a bulwark against China. And he appeared on so many podcasts -- hosted by David Axelrod, Dana Bash, Hugh Hewitt, Hasan Minhaj, Gavin Newsom, Kara Swisher, Bari Weiss -- that I began to wonder if Spotify should just add a Rahm Emanuel channel.\n\nHe's clearly pitching himself to America as a politically incorrect, tell-it-like-it-is fighter. And over the course of several weeks this summer and early fall, he pitched himself to me as someone who can muscle the American dream back into reality for the middle class.\n\nHaving served all three living Democratic presidents, Emanuel has been a key player in nearly every major victory, defeat, negotiation, controversy, and innovation of the modern Democratic Party. But as he gears up for one final act, Democrats will have to ask themselves: Is Rahm Emanuel precisely what the party needs right now -- as it flounders through the Donald Trump era -- or is he exactly whom the party wants to leave behind?\n\nHe wound down his breakfast talking points in typical Rahm fashion: pretending not to care while caring a great deal. \"I am a political animal, full stop. But I'm equally a policy animal,\" he told me. \"I don't give a fuck what else you say.\"\n\nThe summer he was 17 -- shortly after he turned down a scholarship to the Joffrey Ballet in favor of Sarah Lawrence College -- Emanuel sliced open his finger working at an Arby's in the northern suburbs of Chicago. He was cleaning the metal meat-shaving machine, and cleaved his right middle finger down to the bone. He bandaged it up and finished his shift, unaware that a piece of meat was lodged under the skin, and then proceeded to splash around in Lake Michigan with friends. The ensuing infection left him hospitalized for weeks and near death twice, his older brother, Zeke, told me.\n\nAt one point, doctors debated between further antibiotic treatment, which had no guarantee of success, and amputation, which was more likely to solve the problem. \"He's like, 'Take it off!'\" Zeke said. \"'I want to live, and I'm not going to let the two knuckles on my finger stop me.'\" The story became part of the Rahm Emanuel shtick. There was never any, \"'Woe is me, I can't play racquet sports' or whatever the fuck,\" Zeke said.\n\nI spoke with nearly 50 of Emanuel's friends, allies, former colleagues, rivals, skeptics, haters, and fellow Democratic operatives, some of whom requested anonymity not only to share their candid views but also to avoid his infamous wrath. (One person remembered how, after Emanuel's first House primary race, he held a yearslong grudge against EMILY's List for helping his female rival -- despite the fact that this is the exact purpose of EMILY's List.) They all told me similar stories of his relentless drive to survive and win, and how he helped shape our modern politics.\n\nIn 1992, as Bill Clinton's finance director, Emanuel prioritized large donor events to raise money; the cash helped Clinton survive the Gennifer Flowers scandal, which threatened to derail his campaign early in the primaries. In the White House, Emanuel was part of the team that pushed NAFTA and the 1994 crime bill through Congress; both achievements would later haunt 21st-century Democrats. Hillary Clinton tried to have him fired -- she reportedly disdained his aggressive style of doing business -- but Emanuel refused to leave, and accepted a demotion instead.\n\n\"I said, 'Come back to Chicago, man; it's over.' He said, 'No, I'm not going,'\" Axelrod told me. \"Because he cannot fail. He won't accept failure.\" Emanuel clawed his way back to a senior-adviser position. Mythmaking profiles followed, and they are time capsules of Emanuel's prescient sense of voter moods.\n\nAs one administration staffer put it to The New Republic in 1997: \"Rahm felt that Americans believed too many people were coming into this country, too many foreigners, so he wanted to show the administration returning people, deporting them, putting up bigger fences, sending them back.\"\n\nIn the Clinton White House, Emanuel took on assignments that, in his words, \"nobody wanted to touch.\" He helped Clinton implement Operation Gatekeeper, aimed at halting illegal immigration near San Diego. He fielded 3 a.m. calls from Clinton as he whipped votes for two major gun-control laws: the Brady Bill in 1993 (which passed just eight days before NAFTA) and the assault-weapons ban in 1994. He negotiated the final specifics of the Children's Health Insurance Program, which extended health care to millions. He also helped hash out the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 with a Republican-controlled Congress, and the first of Clinton's two increases of the federal minimum wage.\n\nThis was the Democratic Party of the 1990s: a heady run of accomplishment, through combat and compromise with a pre-Trump GOP, even as Clinton was hounded by right-wing inquisitors. Emanuel followed his first tour of the White House with a stint in investment banking. Mergers and acquisitions, though, didn't have the thrill of politics.\n\nEmanuel was elected to the House in 2002, to represent the North Side of Chicago. As chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in 2006, he wrested the chamber from Republican control for the first time in 12 years, and gave Democrats a 31-seat majority.\n\nHe did so with a then-controversial recruitment strategy: enlisting candidates (veterans, athletes, sheriffs) with beliefs (pro-gun, anti-abortion) that fit their swing districts instead of party purity tests. Critics claim that these ephemeral victories in purple districts seeded longer-term defeat for the party; Emanuel says that his goal was to deliver the speaker's gavel to a Democrat, and that he enabled the election of the first female speaker of the House.\n\nEmanuel wants results, in other words. And he can detonate when he doesn't get them.\n\nMultiple members of Emanuel's 2006 DCCC team told me the same story: In June of that year, after Democrats lost a special election in California, he called his team into his office and began shouting. \"We. Worked. Too. Hard. To. Lose. Races. Like. This,\" he said, crushing a water bottle in one hand and rattling a chair with the other. \"You. Worked. Too. Hard. To. Lose. Races. Like. This.\" Someone laughed at Emanuel's tantrum, prompting him to declare, \"If you don't shut the fuck up, I am going to kill every last motherfucking one of you.\" (One of his nicknames is \"Rahmbo.\")\n\nEmanuel had hoped to become the first Jewish speaker, but the incoming president Obama asked him to be his chief of staff. \"No fucking way,\" Emanuel told him, hesitant to put his family through another grueling tour of White House duty. But Obama was persistent in wanting Emanuel's expertise and temperament. \"With an economic crisis to tackle and what I suspected might be a limited window to get my agenda through a Democratically controlled Congress, I was convinced that his pile-driver style was exactly what I needed,\" Obama wrote in his memoir A Promised Land.\n\nEmanuel helped Obama prevent the recession they'd inherited from slipping into a depression. The Obama administration bailed out the auto industry, which Emanuel had urged it to do, but let bankers off the hook, even as Emanuel privately advocated \"Old Testament justice.\" And he was instrumental in whipping votes for and negotiating the minutiae of the Affordable Care Act, once racing from his son's bar mitzvah, after the challah and wine, to the White House to tackle final concerns with holdout Democrats. (\"I told Obama, 'You owe me. You promised it would not be like this, and this is exactly what it is,'\" Emanuel told me, still miffed about the work-life imbalance.)\n\nThe health-care package changed the American economy and millions of lives -- and also became an eternal political cudgel. Even the most recent government shutdown hinges, in part, on ACA subsidies. GOP officials are making \"a political mistake and a policy mistake,\" Emanuel told me. \"It reinforces the brand that Republicans don't care about people.\"\n\nEmanuel's most potent weapon -- both for himself and for his party -- may be his sheer relentlessness, which he can calibrate to be either scorched-earth or supple. As Biden's ambassador to Japan, he once asked to join a meeting between the president and the Japanese prime minister. The National Security Council nixed Emanuel's request; such small, high-level meetings typically would not include an ambassador. Yet when Biden and his aides showed up, there was Emanuel, waiting alongside the Japanese delegation, which he had persuaded to bring him.\n\nThe question now is whether he can sweet-talk -- or bulldoze -- his way into the room yet again.\n\nThe case against Rahm Emanuel, according to critics: He's not progressive enough. His only ideology is winning. He's more of a tactician, less of a principal (though he's long exuded main-character energy). He's too short (he claims 5 foot 8) or too old, at least for voters who want to get away from septuagenarian presidents (he'll be 69 on Inauguration Day 2029). He has a problem with Black voters, stemming from his mayorship (more on that in a bit). He's too Jewish; his middle name is Israel, though he has called Benjamin Netanyahu's \"collective punishment\" of Gazans morally and politically \"bankrupt\" and previously confronted the prime minister over Israeli settlements (Haaretz reported that Netanyahu dubbed Emanuel a \"self-hating Jew,\" though the prime minister has denied this).\n\nThe biggest knock against Emanuel may be that he's too enmeshed with the Democratic Party of the past to emerge as its future. Emanuel is \"a relic\" who made Democrats cave to Big Pharma when writing the Affordable Care Act, Adam Green, a co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, told me. Green's group was among those Emanuel called \"fucking retarded\" for considering running ads against conservative Democrats who were reluctant to support the ACA. To Emanuel, the Democratic Party has morphed from a big-tent results machine into a circular firing squad of activists.\n\nEmanuel is \"the exact wrong answer\" to what the Democratic Party needs right now, because he prioritizes corporate interests, says Cenk Uygur, a co-host of the progressive news program The Young Turks. Uygur believes that Emanuel's power stems from his friendly relationships with the donor class and political reporters, who've been ornamenting his reputation for decades. \"In almost all the profiles, I read about how charming Rahm Emanuel is,\" Uygur told me, but \"from our perspective, all we see is a disastrous ogre, not this charming Shrek guy.\"\n\nRegarding his stance on transgender rights, Parker Molloy wrote in The New Republic in July that Emanuel is \"picking on the people least able to defend themselves and calling it pragmatism.\" Emanuel told me that he'll protect the most vulnerable -- as mayor, he ensured that Chicagoans could use the bathroom consistent with their gender identity -- while not focusing on trans issues. \"Sound is not always fury,\" he often says, meaning the loudest voices do not always amplify the foremost issues. Or, as he put it in a Wall Street Journal op-ed earlier this month: \"We've spent the past five years debating pronouns without noticing that too many students can't tell you what a pronoun is.\"\n\nSome progressives, especially in Chicago, are unwilling to forget or forgive the central test of his mayorship.\n\nIn October 2014, weeks before Emanuel kicked off his reelection campaign, a Black 17-year-old named Laquan McDonald was shot 16 times by a Chicago police officer. Video of the shooting wasn't released until 13 months later. McDonald had not lunged at officers, as the police-union spokesperson had claimed; he'd been shot in the back while walking away. The incident ignited national outrage and accusations of a cover-up by the Chicago Police Department and Emanuel, and some former constituents are still angry. It remains a stain on Emanuel's legacy, and would be easy fodder for any 2028 opponent.\n\n\"He's the mayor. He could have just released it,\" Tracy Siska, the executive director of the Chicago Justice Project, told me. \"The Chicago police had murdered a Black kid for no reason in front of a bunch of cops, and no one did a damn thing.\"\n\nEmanuel has said that he needed to let the official process play out. \"If the mayor weighs in, you're basically compromising those investigations,\" he told me, adding that his intervention could have jeopardized the prosecution of the shooter, who was ultimately convicted of second-degree murder.\n\nShortly after the video was released, Emanuel delivered an emotional apology before the Chicago City Council, his voice cracking as he accepted responsibility for the tragedy. He ultimately pushed through several reforms, including body-worn cameras for all police and a more timely video-release policy. He apologized to and earned the support of Marvin Hunter, McDonald's great-uncle and a Chicago pastor who served as the family's representative. The two regularly speak, and Hunter endorsed Emanuel during his confirmation process to be ambassador.\n\n\"There is more to this individual than the caricature that is presented in the public,\" Hunter wrote to the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations in 2021. \"I felt what is in his heart and I know him to be a decent and honorable man who is willing to listen, eager to learn and show a deep level of compassion.\"\n\nFor as prickly as he can be, Emanuel is skilled at smoothing things over. As mayor, he closed 50 underperforming Chicago schools, in mainly Black and Latino neighborhoods. Janice Jackson, who became the CEO of Chicago Public Schools after the closures, told me that the schools needed to be closed -- because of declining enrollment and budgetary shortfalls -- but communities reeled at the speed of the decision and the brusqueness of the execution. Later in Emanuel's tenure, when he was further consolidating high schools, he did more community outreach, and with a more empathetic tone. \"Did I learn something? Yeah, of course I did,\" he told me, when I asked about the changed approach.\n\nEmanuel points to data from Stanford showing that Chicago-public-school students under his tenure appeared to be learning faster than those in any other of the 100 largest school districts in the country. As Jackson told me, \"I have never met an elected official who cares more about education.\"\n\nEmanuel does care. Even if he doesn't always seem caring. I felt this duality myself as I spent time with him. One humid Tuesday evening in July, I wobbled up to CNN's D.C. studio on an electric scooter, with no helmet. Emanuel was early for our appointment, as usual, and from the look on his face, I could tell that he was waiting with a reprimand.\n\n\"You have three kids,\" Emanuel said, with a mix of stern disappointment and genuine concern, pointing to my unprotected head. \"What are you doing?\"\n\nThis was the paternal, less visible side of Emanuel that I'd heard about: the steady husband who, when his kids were younger, prioritized family dinners with his wife of 31 years, Amy Rule. The devoted father of three who can choke up when talking about his family -- he said he speaks daily with each of his kids -- and who regularly asks about others'. The fervent believer in the promise of America, who prizes loyalty, and inspires it, and sometimes ends phone calls -- even tirades -- with \"I love you.\"\n\n\"Distinguish the caricature from the character,\" Emanuel had told me. When I asked people who had worked for Emanuel if they'd join his presidential campaign, several were open to the idea. And when I asked people for their best Rahm stories, much of what I heard went beyond dead-fish antics and fuck-yous.\n\nSarah Feinberg, who worked for Emanuel at the DCCC and as a senior adviser in the Obama White House, was once mugged at gunpoint. \"Rahm literally checked on me constantly,\" Feinberg told me. \"He had me call him every night when I got home -- not to have a conversation, but so he knew I was home.\"\n\nEmanuel is a boss who'll call on weekends and at all hours, but he's also a boss who encourages work-life balance. Michael Negron, Emanuel's policy director when he was mayor, told me that if Rahm called and heard his kids in the background, \"he'd say, 'Call me when you're free.'\"\n\nRahm Emanuel: It's time to hold American elites accountable for their abuses\n\nShortly after Chicago was named host of the 2024 Democratic National Convention, a local hospitality union reached a contract impasse with a major hotel operator. Karen Kent, the president of the union, called Emanuel, who happened to be at Camp David. He was ambassador to Japan at the time but told her, simply, \"I got it.\" \"Two days later,\" Kent told me, \"those hotel guys called and settled.\"\n\nEmanuel said he'd urged the hotel operator to consider the long term: The convention would bring a ton of business to the city, and the hotel shouldn't be left on the outside because of short-term worries. \"Figuring out what people needed and getting it for them, I think, was always one of his talents,\" Zeke Emanuel told me, explaining how Rahm had honed certain skills as the middle child of three competitive brothers.\n\nA former aide had described Emanuel to me as \"very Tony Soprano-esque\" in the way that his animus is often laced with affection, and vice versa. The week after Rosh Hashanah, I received this text from Emanuel: \"First I start the new year with being nice to you. Will try. Harder.\" Emanuel asked whether I'd reached out to a couple of people he thought I should speak with for this profile. Through an aide, he'd previously sent me a list of a dozen people to call, from his mayoral days. \"Speaker in Virginia said never heard from ashley,\" he texted. \"True?\" When I replied that the people he was now asking about were not on his original list, he responded, \"Don't attack the messenger,\" and then sent me their contact info.\n\nSo I called Don Scott, the first Black speaker of the Virginia House of Delegates, who told me that Emanuel \"helped me navigate the political scene\" in the state. Scott sees in Emanuel a thorny sincerity that can't be faked. \"All these people are being coached on how to be themselves and be real,\" Scott said, \"and Rahm came out of the womb using a motherfucker here and a motherfucker there.\"\n\nAt the end of our call, Scott and I wondered if Emanuel would finally stop pestering us, now that we had connected. But Emanuel was also querying people I'd already interviewed, and then asking me if I was going to use what they'd said.\n\nEmanuel's desire for control manifested even in the photo shoot for this article. Our photographer said in an email that Emanuel had been generous with his time but \"refused most of my location choices,\" \"called me a 'little prick' when I suggested some posing directions (multiple times) and told me he 'knew where I lived in case he didn't like what was printed.'\" Emanuel had done this in his avuncular, shit-giving tone, which had made the photographer laugh but also complicated his assignment.\n\nWaiting with Emanuel in the CNN greenroom before his TV hit, we ran into a reporter we both know, who -- amused to have stumbled upon a profile-in-process -- began snapping photos of us on his phone.\n\nI joked with Emanuel that we could keep the pictures for posterity, to remember the good times in the event that this profile comes out, he hates it, and I'm forever dead to him. He responded by switching to caricature. \"You won't fuck this up,\" Emanuel said, faux-menacing, jabbing four-and-a-half fingers at me, \"because if you do, your kids won't have a mother anymore.\"\n\n\"Just who is the Rahm voter?\" I repeatedly asked people, and the answers were varied: moderates and centrists. Progressives who care about winning the general election. Biden-Trump voters. Washington insiders, yes, but also the working class. Or maybe there's no constituency that could make him a front-runner.\n\nEmanuel, meanwhile, complained to me that I was trying to pigeonhole him. \"You're trying to figure out what box I fit,\" he said, \"and I don't fit a box.\"\n\nCase in point: Emanuel chats with a range of people who would make certain heads explode. The billionaire Republican Ken Griffin, a Chicagoan, supported Emanuel when he ran for Congress and mayor, and the two collaborated to revitalize the Chicago Lakefront Trail. Last month, Emanuel met with the New York mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, a democratic socialist who has provoked centrist Democrats, to talk about how to staff a city administration and turn goals into results. And over the summer, Emanuel met with a few billionaire tech titans: Peter Thiel, whose fortune helped J. D. Vance win his Senate race, and the venture capitalists Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz, whom Emanuel has known for years. Emanuel said that he'd asked Andreessen and Horowitz about improving research funding at universities and in the defense industry.\n\nA few weeks ago, I traveled with Emanuel to the proving ground of Iowa, where his trip's stated purpose -- to campaign and fundraise for Democrats -- collided with its subtext: to test his own prospects.\n\nRose Green, a Des Moines resident, immediately recognized Emanuel at the September 26 homecoming game at Roosevelt High School. \"I heard him on a podcast a few months ago,\" Green told me, \"and I said, 'He's sounding very presidential. He's willing to say what he thinks, and I like that right now.'\" She asked Emanuel if he was going to run for president, and he gave a version of his standard response: He's still thinking about it.\n\nBut he's clearly acting the part. In his 33 hours in Des Moines, Emanuel had coffee with a group of teachers, ate Italian food with fellow politicians, and worked the homecoming crowd at Roosevelt High, where one dad told me, \"I'm a big fan of Obama, so if Obama trusts him, that just gives me good vibes.\" Emanuel also toured a business incubator in a low-income neighborhood, ate two tacos ahogados at a tiny Mexican restaurant, soapboxed at a fish fry hosted by State Representative Sean Bagniewski, and befuddled at least one police officer who, after shaking hands with Emanuel, turned to a colleague and asked, \"Who'd he say he was?\"\n\nBefore Emanuel's day of Iowa campaigning on Saturday, he and I met for breakfast in the lobby of his hotel (again, black coffee and yogurt with berries). Emanuel believes that Kamala Harris lost mainly because she presented herself as a continuation of the Biden administration rather than as a candidate of change, and that she erred by focusing too much on threats to democracy. Yet since Emanuel and I had last spoken, Charlie Kirk had been assassinated in front of thousands of college students, and the Justice Department had begun prosecuting Trump's perceived enemies, such as former FBI Director James Comey. I asked: Did he now find the issue more salient?\n\nEmanuel deflected. \"I think, by 2027, the country is going to be: We've got to get past Trump. We're exhausted,\" he told me. If voters want revenge via a Democratic version of Trump, Emanuel added, then he's not their guy. And over the past several months, Emanuel has repeatedly argued that the 2028 election will not be a referendum on Trump, and that Democrats will need to affirmatively stand for something. Emanuel, in nearly all of his remarks, stands for education and affordability.\n\nHe talks about making homeownership more achievable by giving first-time buyers a $24,000 tax credit or favorable interest rates. He wants to rethink our nation's education system, in part by nationalizing what he did in Chicago, such as free community college for public-high-school graduates with at least a B average. Before entering politics, Emanuel wanted to be a teacher; when he was mayor, his staff would sometimes treat a bad mood with an impromptu visit to a school, which always made him sunnier.\n\nDuring Emanuel's coffee with Iowa educators, a teacher said that he would love to bring Chicago innovations -- such as requiring high-school seniors to have an official \"day after\" graduation plan in order to get their diploma -- to Des Moines.\n\nEmanuel fist-bumped the teacher while addressing a theoretical student: \"You want to be a plumber? Great! You want to be in the Air Force? Great! You want to go to Iowa Technical? Great! But,\" he said, \"we're not letting you go until we know what you're doing.\"\n\nAt the Iowa fish fry, Emanuel began his remarks in a folksy style that struck me as slightly Clintonian, his voice lapsing into a light twang for the first few minutes. At 65, Emanuel still presents as impish: a bit fidgety, a bit smart-ass. His hair has been going gray since the Clinton era, but his skin retains a glow. (The former aide told me that Emanuel is a devotee of Kiehl's face lotion: \"He was very militant about that.\")\n\nMost Iowans I chatted with after they met Emanuel seemed open to the idea of him as a candidate. They liked his candor; one woman told me that she liked how he \"cussed.\" They liked his diagnosis of -- and prescriptions for -- the Democratic Party: that it must focus on delivering results instead of culture squabbles. Emanuel has a whole riff about three 21st-century moments that shattered trust in government -- the Iraq War, the Great Recession, and the response to COVID -- but one line that got heads nodding in Iowa was far simpler: \"The American dream is unaffordable, it's inaccessible, and we as Democrats -- that's unacceptable to us.\"\n\nEarlier this year, Emanuel returned to an investment-banking firm as a senior adviser. Although not yet a candidate, Emanuel has six people working with him on his nascent campaign, and he plans to announce more early next year. In a hypothetical field for a primary season that's two years away, it's impossible to forecast Emanuel's chances. He could bend his party's trajectory once again, or maneuver his way into a Cabinet position or even the vice presidency. Or he could flame out before a single primary vote is cast.\n\nAll his life, failure has been unimaginable, almost physically unbearable. But Emanuel says that he's different now. As he sees it, this would be his last political race, he's already had a full career, and nearly everyone thinks he's a very long shot. So he says he's liberated himself to not care if he loses, and to have fun even if he does. That seems unrealistic, but Emanuel has long practiced the art of spin, and it's possible that he's successfully spun himself.\n\nFor now, he's focused on influencing his own party. Democrats, after all, are in their \"Why the hell not?\" era, and part of Emanuel's pitch is: Why the hell not me?", "url": "https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/10/mayor-rahm-emanuel-2028-presidential-election/684611/"}

Doug LaMalfa made a last-ditch plea to conservative voters to turn in their ballots and reject a plan to redraw the US House map favoring Democrats\n\nCHICO, Calif. -- California Rep. Do...", "content": "Republican Rep. Doug LaMalfa made a last-ditch plea to conservative voters to turn in their ballots and reject a plan to redraw the US House map favoring Democrats\n\nCHICO, Calif. -- California Rep. Doug LaMalfa made a last-ditch plea Wednesday for Republicans to vote 'no' on a ballot measure aimed at pushing him out of office.\n\n\"It's really a blatant power grab,\" he said at a news conference in Chico, a city at the southern end of his district that covers a vast, rural swath of Northern California.\n\nVoting ends Tuesday on Proposition 50, which would create partisan U.S. House maps outside of normal once-a-decade redistricting handled by an independent commission. It's an effort by Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom to counter a Trump-backed plan in Texas to gain five more Republican seats. The new California map aims to dilute Republican voting power by redrawing districts that help Democrats win five more seats.\n\nNewsom says it's a necessary step to defend democracy, but California Republicans call it a power grab that will disenfranchise voters. Republicans currently hold nine of the state's 52 congressional seats.\n\nIf the measure passes, the new maps would be in place for the 2026, 2028 and 2030 midterm elections.\n\nAfter the 2030 Census, the measure promises to give map-drawing power back to the independent commission that typically handles redistricting. But LaMalfa warned it's just the first step toward a permanent, partisan process.\n\n\"If Sacramento is emboldened by this passing, what will stop them?\" he said, noting Democrats hold supermajorities in both chambers in the Legislature.\n\nLaMalfa appeared alongside local elected officials and farmers in his district, which is known for farms that grow rice, olive and other tree nuts, as well as ranching. The new map would split his district, which includes counties that went strongly for President Donald Trump in the last three presidential elections. Parts of his district would the merge with more liberal districts near the coast.\n\nLaMalfa's new district would have many more Democratic voters, making his reelection bid increasingly challenging. But he said Wednesday he plans to seek reelection no matter what. He was first elected to Congress in 2013.\n\nLaMalfa, as well as a handful of other Republican congressmen who could see their districts dramatically reshaped, have mostly stayed away from the campaign spotlight. Voters in Redding, another city in LaMalfa's district, said they have heard little from him leading up to the election.\n\nThe fight for U.S. House control in California has become lopsided in recent weeks as opponents ran low on campaign ads and options. TV advertisements opposing the measure -- a key investment in the sprawling state -- have largely dried up. Newsom told Prop 50 supporters this week they can stop donating to the campaign.\n\nRegistered Democrats in California, who outnumber Republicans by nearly 2-to-1, are also returning nearly twice as many ballots. Even if the conservative strongholds in the Northern part of the state come out strong against the measure, it's unlikely they'll be able to compete with millions of Democratic voters in Los Angeles and the Bay Area.\n\n\"The optimist in me wants to believe we could defeat it,\" said Geri Byrne, a Modoc county supervisor and chair of the Rural County Representatives of California, who appeared with LaMalfa.\n\nA Public Policy Institute of California statewide poll, released Wednesday, found that 56% of likely voters would support the proposition if the election was held today. The poll from the nonpartisan institute said 43% were opposed.\n\nLaMalfa said there's still a fighting chance for Republican voters, and his campaign will continue reaching voters through text messages and social media campaigns. All Californians are mailed a ballot, and he urged people to turn their ballots in now. That's despite Trump urging people not to vote early or by mail in a recent post on his social media site Truth Social.\n\n\"No mail-in or 'Early' Voting, Yes to Voter ID! Watch how totally dishonest the California Prop Vote is!\" he posted Sunday.\n\nLaMalfa said voters should get their ballot in whenever they can.\n\n\"Why would you want to wait till then?

He says it's too late for his family to move back, but he hopes others can stay in a city where the average monthly rent for a one-bedroom is $3,500.\n\n\"That would just make for a better city overall,\" said Murphy, \"and the reason is because city kids just grow up being exposed to more. They're exposed to all the cultures of San Francisco, which makes a more well-rounded person.\"\n\nTiny, colorful San Francisco -- just seven miles squared -- embraces its image as a city that welcomes all. But its inability to build more housing has made it one of the world's toughest places to find a home, risking the diversity it prides itself on.\n\nLurie hopes to change that, with a plan to allow for denser and taller buildings throughout much of the city, including the westside Sunset neighborhood of single-family homes and the tourist friendly Haight-Ashbury, which is studded with classic Victorian and Edwardian homes.\n\nThe issue has roiled the city, and threats of recall loom over San Francisco supervisors who go along with Lurie. At a recent housing rally, the mayor who won a rare reprieve from President Donald Trump's threats to send in federal forces struggled to be heard over angry chants of \"shame!\" and \"liar.\"\n\nProtesters demanded the city invest in 100% below-market rate housing and accused him of being a gentrifier and a Republican.\n\n\"I truly believe that this has San Franciscans' best interests at heart. Are some people going to be fearful? Absolutely. I get it. Change is scary,\" said Lurie, who is a centrist Democrat. \"But the status quo is not working. There's an affordability crisis right now.\"\n\nThe city's estimated 830,000 residents are passionate over both land use and equity. Housing projects have died as pressure to create more affordable units made potential developments unprofitable. Residents also want their stunning views.\n\nBut San Francisco is under pressure from the state to adopt a new zoning plan allowing for 36,000 more homes by 2031 -- or else the state will decide what gets built where -- and the mayor likely has the votes to pass his \"Family Zoning Plan.\"\n\nSupporters say it's a matter of supply and demand, and that more homes will bring down the overall cost of housing.\n\nCritics say such trickle-down economics will not work in a city like San Francisco, which is in such global demand that some foreign investors buy properties sight-unseen. They say developers will only build luxury housing that's too costly for most workers, while displacing tenants and destroying the character of entire neighborhoods.\n\n\"There's a herd of elephants in the room that no one will address,\" says Eric Jaye, a Democratic political consultant who opposes the plan.\n\nMuch of the housing push has come from Democrats, including a former city mayor, Gov. Gavin Newsom, who signed into law a proposal by San Francisco state Sen. Scott Wiener to build more homes near transit.\n\nThe city has made enormous strides in recent years, with whole districts of tall condo buildings cropping up around downtown, says Rafael Mandelman, president of the Board of Supervisors. But he acknowledges that people come to San Francisco for its more intimate neighborhoods and access to green space.\n\n\"San Francisco, historically, was the city for people who didn't love cities,\" Mandelman said.\n\nKatherine Roberts, 72, initially welcomed construction of an affordable housing complex near the three-story Edwardian she labored to buy in the Haight-Ashbury neighborhood two decades ago.\n\nBut at 160 units and eight stories high, the massive building has shattered her peace of mind, dominating her view.\n\n\"I'm looking out and it's like I'm living in East Germany. How can you build something this inappropriate in a historic neighborhood like the Haight-Ashbury?\" Roberts said. \"What about all the people who already live here? What are we supposed to do?\"\n\nFor the most part, the new zoning plan allows for more housing to be packed into the space of a single-family home -- say a duplex with a studio -- without exceeding the city's height limit of roughly four stories for such properties. At least 15% of new housing must be below-market rate.\n\nBuildings on neighborhood commercial corridors could double to eight stories. Busier thoroughfares could see high-rises of 10 stories and more, and in a few spots, on Van Ness Avenue, heights could hit 650 feet (200 meters), rivaling some downtown skyscrapers.\n\nPassage of Lurie's proposal won't necessarily lead to more homes in a city with high labor and construction costs and \"notoriously complex and cumbersome\" approval processes, as the state said in a scathing 2023 review.\n\nAnd so city dwellers make do with overcrowded -- and sometimes awkward -- living situations.\n\nLaura Foote, executive director of \"yes in my backyard\" YIMBY Action, wound up living with the man who is now her husband -- and the woman he was divorcing -- in a one-bedroom apartment for about six months, until his ex could find another rental.\n\n\"We didn't kill each other,\" Foote said, \"but it went on longer than it would have in a well-functioning housing market.\"\n\nSupervisors are still negotiating amendments to the zoning plan, which could be voted out of committee on Monday for consideration by the full board. Some supervisors want to exempt historic properties, or all buildings currently used for housing. The mayor agreed to exempt buildings with at least three rent-controlled units.\n\nThe compromise was a major relief for Phyllis Nabhan, 78, who lives in the Richmond neighborhood, between the Golden Gate Bridge and Golden Gate Park. She fears becoming homeless if a developer scoops up the property she's called home for 47 years, starting with a rent of just $350 a month.\n\nBut Nabhan still objects to the proposal. She says it would ruin her neighborhood's \"cozy and wonderful\" feel, and blames the state for forcing the city to change.\n\n\"I think that this mayor is trying,\" she said. \"It's a horrible job, I wouldn't want to be mayor.\"", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/san-francisco-mayor-proposes-denser-housing-tackle-affordability-127006740"}

Gavin Newsom is pushing a ballot measure to counter the president's own effort to rejigger the congressional map to elect more Republicans.\n\nThat announcement was followed with a pre-emptive attack by Trump on the legitimacy of California's elections. The post on his own social media platform echoed the baseless allegations he made about the 2020 presidential election before he and his allies tried to overturn his loss in a campaign that culminated in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.\n\n\"Watch how totally dishonest the California Prop Vote is!\" Trump wrote last weekend on Truth Social, referring to Proposition 50, the lone issue on the state's special election ballot. \"Millions of Ballots being 'shipped.'\"\n\nThe combination has prompted responses from several prominent Democrats, who were already bracing for Trump to use his presidential powers to tilt next year's midterms to his side.\n\n\"It's a bridge they're trying to build the scaffolding for, all across this country, in next November's elections,\" Newsom said in a video in which he also predicted the administration will send masked immigration agents to polling stations next week.\n\nDuring early voting so far, there has been no indication that troops or federal officers have shown up near polling sites or ballot drop boxes in any state. Despite the warnings from some Democrats, millions of voters already have cast ballots through early in-person or mail voting, a process that has produced no significant problems.\n\nTrump has long accused the Biden administration of trying to interfere in last year's presidential election after the Justice Department filed federal charges against him related to his attempts to overturn the 2020 results and his retention of classified documents after leaving office.\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson, using the president's favorite derogatory nickname for California's governor, said in a statement on Wednesday: \"Newscum ought to stop fearmongering to score political points with the radical left flank of the Democrat party that he is courting ahead of his doomed-to-fail presidential campaign.\"\n\nTuesday's elections are purely state-based, with no federal offices on the ballot. Trump has no ability to change the outcome in any way, experts said.\n\n\"Voters who go to vote in the 2025 election are going to find a very safe and secure process,\" said David Becker, a former Department of Justice voting rights attorney who now runs the Center for Election Innovation & Research. \"For example, I'm 100% confident that whoever wins the statewide elections in Virginia and New Jersey, regardless of what the president says, will take office.\"\n\nThe relatively low-profile off-year elections are headlined by the races for governor in New Jersey and Virginia, California's redistricting question and the mayor's race in New York City.\n\nTwo of the states where voting already is underway are considering measures that have major implications for next year's midterms.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, voters will decide whether three Democratic justices keep their seats on the state's supreme court. If they're removed, the court will have a 2-2 ideological split and potentially be unable to resolve disputes over voting and election procedures next year in the critical swing state.\n\nIn California, voters will decide whether to temporarily override an independent redistricting process and allow the Democratic-controlled Legislature to redraw the state's congressional districts. If voters pass the measure, it could create five new seats Democrats could win to counter Trump's push for Texas and other Republican-led states to redraw their districts and increase the number of winnable Republican House seats.\n\nThat's one reason the administration's decision to send monitors drew so much attention. It's not unusual for the federal government to send monitors to observe voting and ballot counting in certain areas, but it's typically done in consultation with local jurisdictions. That did not happen this time.\n\nInstead, the Trump administration announced the monitors solely in response to requests from local Republican parties.\n\nFederal monitors are only allowed to observe, are prohibited from talking to voters or even poll workers, and have no way to influence the counting of votes, said Becker, who has served as a monitor and also trained them.\n\n\"I don't think voters are ever going to notice or see any of these people,\" he said.\n\nStill, the Democratic attorneys general in California and New Jersey raised alarms, with New Jersey's Matt Platkin calling it \"highly inappropriate\" and California's Rob Bonta saying the move is especially concerning given Trump's record.\n\n\"These are not normal times,\" Bonta said in a call with reporters this week. \"We have to look at the broader context here about what the Trump administration is saying and what they are doing.\"\n\nThe action follows a monthslong campaign by Trump to use the powers of his office to boost his party's political prospects ahead of the midterms, where the incumbent party traditionally loses seats in Congress. The president has pushed states where Republicans control the redistricting process to redraw their boundaries to create more conservative-friendly seats. He also has directed his administration to investigate Democratic politicians, fundraisersand donors.\n\nNewsom and his Illinois counterpart, Gov. JB Pritzker, have warned that Trump's attempts to send the U.S. military into their states' most populous cities -- Los Angeles and Chicago -- are precursors to deploying the military or federal agents to polling places in Democratic-leaning cities next year.\n\nThey and other Democrats also have alluded to how some Trump allies in 2020 used manufactured claims of election fraud to propose using the military to seize voting machines.\n\nAt the same time, the Justice Department is demanding detailed voter data from the states and Trump issued an executive order trying to reshape how elections are run, which has been largely halted by the courts because the Constitution gives that power to the states, and, in some cases, Congress. It spells out no role for the president in setting election rules.\n\nUntil fairly recently, Trump had been relatively quiet about the 2025 elections, mostly taking steps that other presidents have made in election years, such as supporting his party's nominees in key races.\n\nHannah Fried, executive director of the voting rights group All Voting is Local, said the Nov. 4 election will provide \"an important set of data points\" about issues that could crop up in future elections, especially next year.\n\n\"That's the big dog,\" Fried said of the midterms. \"Everybody in the country's going to be voting in 2026. This is about control of Congress. As a country, we all have a stake in that.\"", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/trump-ramps-involvement-years-elections-preview-midterms-pressure-127006659"}

I really believe it is Code Red. It's five alarm fire,\" Newsom told ABC News' Jonathan Karl.\n\n\"We won't have a country. We won't have an election that's fair and free if we don't stand up. We won't. There will not be a fair and free election. It'll be a Putin election. Was it 87% or is it 87.3%? That's what Trump wants.\"\n\n\"All the pardoning, all the, this, this great grift -- the biggest, most corrupt administration in history. Not just the $400 million plane, but the billion dollars of your tax money, as we're cutting food stamps to pay for the damn plane so he can take that toy home with his foundation when he's 93 or whatever he's done with his fourth or fifth term.\"\n\n\"I'm deeply concerned about it. And guys like [former Trump adviser Steve] Bannon, they're not screwing around. They're not screwing around.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid we're going to lose our country. And where the hell is everybody? Why aren't we standing up to principle?\" Newsom asked.\n\n\"I'm disgusted what's happened in this country. I'm disgusted by the supine Congress. I'm disgusted by how the private sector is conducting themselves. I'm disgusted by universities selling their soul and law firms. I'm disgusted that people are not more outraged. Forgive me,\" Newsom continued.\n\nNews contrasted the \"childishness\" of Trump to former President Joe Biden, who he called \"one of the most successful presidents in the last century.\"\n\nNewsom told Karl that while he did have disagreements with the former president on issues such as the border, the governor celebrated Biden's long list of accomplishments that he said are being wiped out by Trump.\n\n\"I will defend that to my grave in terms of the CHIPS and Science Act. The infrastructure bill, the work he did on the IRA. The fact that he had a worker-centered industrial policy, and the fact that those are the right policies for this country,\" Newsom said in the interview that aired Wednesday on ABC News Live.\n\nThe governor slammed Trump for his policy actions but expressed more anger at the trolling Trump has done on social media and in interviews.\n\nThe two-term Democrat cited the president posting a photoshopped image of himself as the Pope and Superman and on Mount Rushmore as some of the wildest examples.\n\nNewsom said he's countering the president by putting \"a mirror up to Trump and his childishness\" through his own social media trolling over the last few months. The governor has posted images on his social media accounts belittling Trump's appearance on a Time magazine cover, and another that depicted the president as Marie Antoinette.\n\n\"To put a mirror up to this absurdity to call people out for their complicity. I mean, this is the president of the United States. These are mirroring what he has done, and people have allowed this to be normalized,\" he said.\n\nNewsom said he's not worried about retribution from the president, noting that Trump has already punished California by cutting back on federal funding for projects such as high-speed rail.\n\n\"He's gone after us like no other state, and that's when [his and Trump's] state of mind was collaborative,\" he noted.\n\nStill, the governor said that he and Trump get along \"extraordinarily well,\" particularly in past private conversations.\n\n\"He doesn't want interpersonal confrontation. Rare is that the case,\" Newsom said.\n\n\"But he'll attack in public when you're not there,\" Karl asked.\n\n\"Yeah, and then he'll lie about things,\" the governor responded. \"There's nothing except it's not. It's more the same.\"\n\nNewsom reflected on how the Democrats lost last year's election and some of their missteps, including handling the border. The governor noted there was a \"point of real friction\" between the Biden administration and himself and other governors who saw an influx of migrants.\n\n\"As I was working with the Biden administration, I said, 'You need to wake up to what's going on,'\" he said.\n\n\"Folks in Colorado, in Illinois and New York and elsewhere were expressing that frustration. I think we took the wrong lessons from the midterm where we overperformed, and that was a tactical mistake, but it's also wrong, period, on policy,\" he added.\n\nNewsom remained confident about the future of his party, saying that it is \"now appearing to be back on their toes, not their heels.\" He pushed other leaders to aggressively stand up to Trump as he continues to \"attack every single institution of independent thinking.\"\n\n\"[Trump is] succeeding because we're still playing by the old set of rules. And so my party needs to focus first and foremost on recognizing that. And then we'll reconcile, be more culturally normal, more reform-oriented, talk about service and patriotism,\" he said.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/newsom-us-faces-5-alarm-fire-warns-country/story?id=126994453"}

Earlier on Wednesday, the Maryland state Senate chose \"not to move forward\" with mid-decade redistricting, according to a letter obtained by ABC News.\n\nA new lawsuit filed Monday seeks to redraw New York's congressional maps in favor of Democrats, with plaintiffs arguing that the current lines are unconstitutional for misrepresenting Black and Latino votes, according to The Associtated Press.\n\nLegislators in Republican-controlled Kansas and Florida have also indicated that they are considering mid-decade redistricting.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/majority-california-voters-support-prop-50-poll-shows/story?id=126993031"}

Those agents have been the ones tackling people to the ground, tearing them from cars and snatching them from their places of work, detaining citizens and noncitizens alike.\n\nOne of the most notorious figures behind this operation is Greg Bovino. He's a senior official with U.S. Customs and Border Protection, a DHS agency that is seen within the Trump administration as more willing than other agencies, like the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, to go along with the most aggressive parts of the president's mass-deportation scheme.\n\nIn many ways, Bovino has become the face of this project. Most folks first heard of him over the summer as the guy overseeing CBP operations during the federal invasion of Los Angeles. In July, agents in armored vehicles and on horseback disrupted a children's summer camp in MacArthur Park. After Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass and California Gov. Gavin Newsom both objected to that dangerous stunt, Bovino went on TV to tell them both, effectively, to take a hike.\n\n\"The federal government is not leaving L.A.,\" he told the local Fox affiliate. \"I don't work for Karen Bass, the federal government doesn't work for Karen Bass. We're going to be here until that mission's accomplished, as I said, and you better get used to us now because this is going to be normal very soon.\"\n\nBovino has since moved on to the administration's operations in Chicago, where he was caught on camera personally throwing a can of tear gas at civilians during a raid on a parking lot last Thursday.\n\nAccording to a legal filing, on that same day, one of Bovino's agents pointed a gun at a protester, a U.S. veteran, and said, \"bang bang\" and \"you're dead, liberal.\"\n\nIt is worth noting that there is an existing temporary restraining order from Oct. 9 prohibiting federal agents from using chemical munitions in Chicago against civilians and journalists who do not pose a threat.\n\nHowever, it doesn't appear that federal agents are abiding by that order. In addition to that incident from last Thursday, residents and demonstrators over the weekend confronted Border Patrol agents near a Halloween parade after they arrested an undocumented construction worker who came to the U.S. as a child. According to witnesses and videos taken at the scene, federal agents then started lobbing tear gas, just minutes before the start of the scheduled parade.\n\n\"You had parents on the street literally taking their kids to this Halloween parade when this happened,\" one resident told a local news station. \"And I didn't see anybody with a weapon. I didn't see anybody make physical contact with these agents.\"\n\nBovino was hauled into court in Chicago on Tuesday to answer for that behavior. And the court obviously believes he needs to be reined in -- the judge ordered Bovino to appear in court every day this week to provide a status report on his actions in Chicago.\n\nHe will also be forced to turn over use-of-force reports and accompanying body camera footage. (He and his agents are now required to use body cameras.)\n\nWhile Bovino was being admonished in court, we learned that there is a purge happening within Homeland Security to strengthen its most violent, reactionary tendencies. Those in favor of what's called more \"targeted\" immigration enforcement are being pushed out, so that Bovino can more easily undertake Trump adviser Stephen Miller's draconian vision of mass deportation.\n\nAs NBC News reports:\n\nIn short, Trump's top aides think ICE leadership is too soft and want to replace it with Border Patrol leaders, who are seen as more aggressive and willing to go along with whatever this administration asks.\n\nBut believe me, this is just the beginning. After Republicans provided Homeland Security with an unprecedented surge in funding, the agency is spending billions to recruit thousands more agents, with aggressive marketing campaigns and signing bonuses. Trump wants them to be, effectively, his federal police force, wreaking havoc on the streets of this country.\n\nThat may be especially true heading into next year's midterm elections. Several experts in elections and democracy spoke to The Atlantic about their fears that Trump will deploy armed agents to polling places to sow chaos and intimidation and to maintain power.\n\nThis is a plan, it is worth noting, that the president's ally Steve Bannon is openly bragging about. \"They're petrified over at MSNBC and CNN that, 'hey, since we're taking control of the cities, there's going to be ICE officers near polling places,'\" Bannon said on his podcast earlier this year. \"You're damn right.\"\n\nBannon has also doubled down on his threat that Trump would run for a third term, telling The Economist that there's a \"plan\" in the works. \"Trump is going to be president in '28 and people ought to just get accommodated with that,\" he said.", "url": "https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-chicago-immigration-raids-greg-bovino-rcna240481"}

The result: a potential five-seat gain for the GOP with the hopes of bolstering their fragile majority in the U.S. House.\n\nCalifornia Democrats, led by Gov. Gavin Newsom, responded in kind. They've proposed a referendum, which is expected to pass next week, to sideline their own bipartisan commission -- once a model for reform -- in pursuit of maps that could deliver five seats to Democrats.\n\nThe dominoes continue to fall.\n\nRepublicans in Missouri and North Carolina have already redrawn their maps, and Indiana is expected to follow suit.\n\nMr. Wilder, 94, is a veteran of Virginia's political trenches and no stranger to the intricacies of redistricting.\n\nBefore he made history as the nation's first Black governor, he broke barriers as the first Black state senator in Virginia since Reconstruction.\n\nThere, he chaired the influential Privileges and Elections Committee, playing a central role in shaping legislative maps, years before Virginia voters weighed in on the creation of a redistricting commission through a 2020 referendum, which 66% of voters approved.\n\n\"I wasn't supportive of that change at the time,\" he said of establishing the bipartisan commission.\n\nHe said the Privileges and Elections Committee, much like the bipartisan commission, was also composed of Democrats and Republicans, and handled the redrawing of districts \"pretty well throughout the years.\"\n\n\"So to say that you are going to allow now a bipartisan commission is saying you're gonna capitalize what you had, rather than leave it in small letters,\" he said.\n\nMr. Wilder stressed that dismantling the redistricting commission won't be easy, noting that it's now embedded in the state Constitution, a structural hurdle that complicates any effort to remove it.\n\n\"It's more difficult to change the Constitution than it is to change statutory language,\" he said. \"But I think it was a mistake to begin with.\" He added, \"What is the best way to correct that mistake? That is what we are talking about now.\"", "url": "https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2025/oct/29/doug-wilder-americas-first-black-governor-backs-scrapping-virginias/"}

Instead, they said, the agency is planning to keep it on hand to respond to natural disasters.\n\nSENATE GOP DIVIDED AS MILLIONS RISK LOSING FOOD AID IN SHUTDOWN STANDOFF\n\nStates warned in the lawsuit Tuesday that halting the SNAP payments, even in the near-term, threatens disproportionate harm for the roughly 42 million Americans that currently receive SNAP aid beginning on Nov. 1, when the food assistance is slated to expire.\n\n\"Shutting off SNAP benefits will cause deterioration of public health and well-being,\" state leaders said in the lawsuit.\n\n\"Ultimately, states will bear costs associated with many of these harms,\" they added. \"The loss of SNAP benefits leads to food insecurity, hunger, and malnutrition, which are associated with numerous negative health outcomes in children, such as poor concentration, decreased cognitive function, fatigue, depression, and behavioral problems.\"\n\nNEW YORK ATTORNEY GENERAL LETITIA JAMES ENTERS PLEA IN FEDERAL MORTGAGE FRAUD CASE\n\nThe lawsuit was filed by a coalition of attorneys general and governors from Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, D.C., Hawaii, Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin.\n\nIn the near-term, the states asked U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani, the federal judge in Massachusetts assigned to the case, to order the Trump administration to release the USDA contingency funds to help ensure there is not a lapse in SNAP program benefits beginning Nov. 1.\n\nJudge Talwani will hear from both parties during an emergency status hearing Wednesday,during which she will weigh the states' request for an emergency order to force USDA to release a portion of its emergency funds to SNAP recipients.\n\nSCHUMER AGAIN BLOCKS GOP BID TO REOPEN GOVERNMENT AS AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS GO UNPAID\n\nThe USDA, for its part, has not yet shared details on the policy decision or decision not to funnel the contingency funds to SNAP beneficiaries.\n\nA note on its website states simply that, \"[T]he well has run dry.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"At this time, there will be no benefits issued November 01,\" the agency said.", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/politics/states-sue-trump-admin-over-billions-looming-cuts-snap-food-stamps"}

To enforce it, Character.AI said, over the next month the company will identify which users are minors and put time limits on their use of the app. Once the measure begins, those users will not be able to converse with the company's chatbots.\n\n\"We're making a very bold step to say for teen users, chatbots are not the way for entertainment, but there are much better ways to serve them,\" Karandeep Anand, Character.AI's chief executive, said in an interview. He said the company also planned to establish an A.I. safety lab.\n\nThe moves follow mounting scrutiny over how chatbots sometimes called A.I. companions can affect users' mental health. Last year, Character.AI was sued by the family of Sewell Setzer III, a 14-year-old in Florida who killed himself after constantly texting and conversing with one of Character.AI's chatbots. His family accused the company of being responsible for his death.\n\nThe case became a lightning rod for how people can develop emotional attachments to chatbots, with potentially dangerous results. Character.AI has since faced other lawsuits over child safety. A.I. companies including the ChatGPT maker OpenAI have also come under scrutiny for their chatbots' effects on people -- especially youths -- if they have sexually explicit or toxic conversations.\n\nIn September, OpenAI said it planned to introduce features intended to make its chatbot safer, including parental controls. This month, Sam Altman, OpenAI's chief executive, posted on social media that the company had \"been able to mitigate the serious mental health issues\" and would relax some of its safety measures.\n\n(The New York Times has sued OpenAI and Microsoft, claiming copyright infringement of news content related to A.I. systems. The two companies have denied the suit's claims.)\n\nIn the wake of these cases, lawmakers and other officials have begun investigations and proposed or passed legislation aimed at protecting children from A.I. chatbots. On Tuesday, Senators Josh Hawley, Republican of Missouri, and Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, introduced a bill to bar A.I. companions for minors, among other safety measures.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom this month signed a California law that requires A.I. companies to have safety guardrails on chatbots. The law takes effect Jan. 1.\n\n\"The stories are mounting of what can go wrong,\" said Steve Padilla, a Democrat in California's State Senate, who had introduced the safety bill. \"It's important to put reasonable guardrails in place so that we protect people who are most vulnerable.\"\n\nMr. Anand of Character.AI did not address the lawsuits his company faces. He said the start-up wanted to set an example on safety for the industry \"to do far more than what the regulation might require.\"\n\nCharacter.AI was founded in 2021 by Noam Shazeer and Daniel De Freitas, two former Google engineers, and raised nearly $200 million from investors. Last year, Google agreed to pay about $3 billion to license Character.AI's technology, and Mr. Shazeer and Mr. De Freitas returned to Google.\n\nCharacter.AI allows people to create and share their own A.I. characters, such as custom anime avatars, and it markets the app as A.I. entertainment. Some personas can be designed to simulate girlfriends, boyfriends or other intimate relationships. Users pay a monthly subscription fee, starting at about $8, to chat with the companions. Until its recent concern about underage users, Character.AI did not verify ages when people signed up.\n\nLast year, researchers at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign analyzed thousands of posts and comments that young people had left in Reddit communities dedicated to A.I. chatbots, and interviewed teenagers who used Character.AI, as well as their parents. The researchers concluded that the A.I. platforms did not have sufficient child safety protections, and that parents did not fully understand the technology or its risks.\n\n\"We should pay as much attention as we would if they were chatting with strangers,\" said Yang Wang, one of the university's information science professors. \"We shouldn't discount the risks just because these are nonhuman bots.\"\n\nCharacter.AI has about 20 million monthly users, with less than 10 percent of them self-reporting as being under the age of 18, Mr. Anand said.\n\nUnder Character.AI's new policies, the company will immediately place a two-hour daily limit on users under the age of 18. Starting Nov. 25, those users cannot create or talk to chatbots, but can still read previous conversations. They can also generate A.I. videos and images through a structured menu of prompts, within certain safety limits, Mr. Anand said.\n\nHe said the company had enacted other safety measures in the past year, such as parental controls.\n\nGoing forward, it will use technology to detect underage users based on conversations and interactions on the platform, as well as information from any connected social media accounts, he said. If Character.AI thinks a user is under 18, the person will be notified to verify his or her age.\n\nDr. Nina Vasan, a psychiatrist and director of a mental health innovation lab at Stanford University that has done research on A.I. safety and children, said it was \"huge\" that a chatbot maker would bar minors from using its app. But she said the company should work with child psychologists and psychiatrists to understand how suddenly losing access to A.I. companions would affect young users.\n\n\"What I worry about is kids who have been using this for years and have become emotionally dependent on it,\" she said. \"Losing your friend on Thanksgiving Day is not good.\"", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/29/technology/characterai-underage-users.html"}

Rural voters would be outnumbered, making it unlikely for a Republican candidate to prevail.\n\n\"Most of us see it as, you know, just massive gerrymandering, taking what little representation that we had away and now we'll have absolutely nothing,\" Patrick Jones, a former Shasta County supervisor, said in a recent interview in his family's gun shop.\n\nVoting concludes Nov. 4 on the measure, which would create partisan U.S. House maps outside of normal once-a-decade redistricting handled by an independent commission. It's an effort by Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom to counter a Trump-backed plan in Texas to gain five more Republican seats. He says it's necessary to defend democracy, but California Republicans call it a power grab that will disenfranchise voters. Republicans currently hold nine of the state's 52 congressional seats.\n\nIn Redding, one of the largest cities north of Sacramento, bright yellow signs urging residents to defend fair elections and rural representation dot the highway. A local man recently led a one-person protest in front of City Hall, while more than 150 others showed up at a rally to reject what they see as a scheme by Democrats to take away their voices.\n\nBut they face an uphill battle in the state where registered Democrats outnumber Republicans by nearly 2-to-1. Democrats have returned nearly twice as many ballots. Labor unions and other Democratic allies have mobilized hundreds of volunteers to reach voters in solidly blue areas like Los Angeles with millions of voters. Two weeks before Election Day, just about 7,000 ballots had been returned in Shasta County, county clerk Clint Curtis said. He expects lower turnout than normal.\n\nTV advertising opposing the measure -- a key investment in the sprawling state -- has largely dried up. Some residents in Redding say they've heard little from Republican Rep. Doug LaMalfa about a plan to fight the measure, though he's scheduled an event Wednesday in another city in his district.\n\nUnder the new maps, voters in Shasta, Siskiyou and Modoc counties -- all conservative strongholds in the rural north -- would be in the same congressional district with Marin County, which sits just across the Golden Gate Bridge from San Francisco.\n\nLaMalfa's current district includes farms that grow rice, olive and other tree nuts, and ranching is prevalent in the farthest northern reaches. Lassen National Volcanic Park, historic Shasta Dam and snow-capped Mt. Shasta are defining features. Redding has a population under 100,000. Distrust of government and belief in election conspiracies are common. In 2024, 67% of voters in Shasta County supported Trump.\n\nMarin County, meanwhile, went 80% for Democrat Kamala Harris. The median household income tops $140,000 -- roughly double that of Shasta County. It's part of a district that runs north up the Pacific coastline to Oregon and is known for redwood forests, wine production and cannabis farms. It's represented by Democratic Rep. Jared Huffman.\n\nLaMalfa, a rice farmer, opposes the proposition and has spent at least $63,000 from his campaign fund to reach voters through text messages and yard signs. He also gave $50,000 to a statewide \"no\" campaign. Brenda Haynes, who works in LaMalfa's district office, said the congressman has joined residents waving flags on highway overpasses. His campaign declined a request for a reporter to shadow him on the trail.\n\n\"I think he's done phone calls and stuff, but I haven't really heard from him,\" said Toby Ruiz, a retired state worker who's lived in the area for most of his life.\n\nLaMalfa's supporters say they appreciate his conservative stances and push for an important new water storage project.\n\n\"I pretty much love the guy,\" said Bob Braz, a Redding area native who owns a bait shop. \"I stand for almost all the things that he's done.\"\n\nThose who don't know much about LaMalfa's record said they trust him because of his background.\n\n\"I don't hear much about him but he's a farmer,\" said Liz Jacobs, who moved from the Bay Area to Redding 20 years ago. She added: \"I don't know about somebody from the Bay Area with their progressive ideas.\"\n\nNewsom and other Democrats say the measure is a tool to fight Trump's agenda and counter Republican efforts to pickup seats elsewhere. Even if it passes and Democrats win five more seats, it may not help the party retain the House. Republicans in Missouri, North Carolina and Indiana are joining Texas in trying to draw more winnable seats in the 2026 midterms. Lawmakers in Virginia, meanwhile, are back in session to work on a map more friendly to Democrats. All of the efforts are sure to face legal challenges.\n\n\"This is not the fight we want to fight. This was not our battle,\" Newsom said in a recent virtual campaign event. \"This is in reaction to something unprecedented that happened.\"\n\nBut voters in Redding see it as another way to silence their voices.\n\nThey have long felt neglected by the Democratic-controlled Legislature in Sacramento, which they blame for raising the cost of living and infringing on local control. Lawmakers, for example, banned counties from hand-counting ballots in most cases after Shasta County leaders voted to get rid of their vote-counting machines in 2023.\n\nSome said they worry that national Republicans won't put up a fight to hold the seats if the measure passes.\n\n\"You would have to spend a huge amount of money to reach your base,\" said Jones, the former county supervisor. \"And they're just simply not going to want to waste that amount of money because it would be better spent throughout the country elsewhere.\"\n\nNot all voters are dreading a change.\n\nWarren Swanson, a Redding resident of more than 40 years, called LaMalfa \"Do Nothing Doug.\" His wife, Tara Swanson, also voted \"yes\" on the measure, partly because it promises to give map-drawing power back to the independent commission after the 2030 Census.\n\n\"Do two wrongs make a right? It's a tough one for those of us who think along those lines,\" Tara Swanson said.\n\nSome liberal voters in Mt. Shasta in Siskiyou County are hoping to oust LaMalfa over his vote for Trump's sweeping tax and spending bill that will overhaul health care and food assistance programs. Mothers, families and older adults in town could go hungry because of changes to food assistance programs, said Colleen Shelly, a Mt. Shasta resident who works with the state food assistance program.\n\nBut the fight is far from over for Republican voters in California, said Walter Stephen Rubke, a 38-year-old who moved to Redding last year. Many young people are supporting conservatives, he said, and he expects continual resistance from GOP voters even if the measure passes.\n\n\"I see a hard path ahead,\" he said. \"But I feel confident.

It's about serving those that are hungry,\" he said.\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson pushed back sharply, accusing the governor of hypocrisy.\n\n\"It's preposterous that Newsom, who shuttered churches during COVID and recently derided the power of prayer, is now attempting to manipulate religion to fit his own political agenda,\" Jackson said in a statement to Fox News Digital.\n\n\"President Trump wants the government open -- the Democrats' insistence on keeping it shut down is hurting the American people, but they could prevent these harms by simply reopening the government.

In government-speak, that means she is an attorney providing legal counsel to the governor and state agencies.\n\n\"Michele brings to our office more than 20 years of legal experience and invaluable knowledge of the law,\" said Tara Gallegos, a spokeswoman for Mr. Newsom. \"Trump's loss is California's gain.\"\n\nThe White House referred a request for comment on Ms. Beckwith's new role to the Department of Justice, which declined to comment on the matter.\n\nThe New York Times first reported last month that Ms. Beckwith had been quietly fired less than six hours after emailing Gregory Bovino, the Border Patrol chief based in Southern California, that he would have to abide by court orders and the Constitution while conducting a planned operation in her district.\n\nShe sent the email to Mr. Bovino on July 15 after he had notified her that he was headed to Sacramento for an immigration operation. She said she wanted to ensure he knew about court orders in her district requiring that Border Patrol agents could only detain people if they had a reasonable suspicion that those people were violating federal immigration law.\n\nThat afternoon, Ms. Beckwith received an email from the White House stating that her employment with the Department of Justice was terminated \"on behalf of President Donald J. Trump.\" Her phone and computer went dark, and she was marched out of the office.\n\nTwo days later, Mr. Bovino and his agents raided a Home Depot parking lot in Sacramento. He posted a video on X in which he said: \"Folks, there is no such thing as a sanctuary city. There is no such thing as a sanctuary state.\"\n\nMr. Bovino said in an emailed statement last month to The New York Times, \"The former Acting US Attorney's email suggesting that the United States Border Patrol does not ALWAYS abide by the Constitution revealed a bias against law enforcement.\"\n\nMr. Bovino's tactics have come under scrutiny in Chicago, where a federal judge admonished him on Tuesday after the agency apparently violated her orders restricting the use of force and tear gas.\n\nMs. Beckwith's firing was an early example of the president's ousting of top federal prosecutors who did not carry out his agenda. After firing her, he fired a U.S. attorney in Virginia who had determined there was not enough evidence to indict James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director, and Letitia James, the New York State attorney general, both of whom are political targets of the president. The replacement U.S. attorney later indicted both of them.\n\nThere are 93 U.S. attorneys who oversee federal prosecutions in districts around the country. Ms. Beckwith, a career prosecutor, had been working as the No. 2 attorney in the office when her boss, who had been appointed by the Biden administration, resigned shortly before Mr. Trump was inaugurated. She then kept doing her old job while filling in as acting U.S. attorney.\n\nMr. Trump not only removed her as acting U.S. attorney but also ended her career as a federal prosecutor, a move experts said was unusual.\n\nMs. Beckwith, who started her new job last week, said in an interview that she was still getting acclimated and was looking forward to \"a very interesting year.\"\n\n\"To me, it's not political -- it's existential for our country,\" she said. \"So if there's something I can do to assist in keeping our democracy and Constitution alive, that is what I am happy to do.\"", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/28/us/trump-fired-us-attorney-michele-beckwith-new-job.html"}

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.\n\nThe National Park Service (NPS) announced that three people have been convicted of illegal BASE jumping in a national park, as the agency warns would-be outlaws it's still enforcing the law despite the federal shutdown.\n\n\"We do not tolerate illegal activity in Yosemite National Park,\" Yosemite Superintendent Raymond McPadden said. \"Our law enforcement rangers remain efficient, effective and vigilant 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. These convictions demonstrate the professionalism and dedication of Yosemite's protection team in upholding federal regulations and ensuring the safety of both visitors and first responders.\"\n\nThough Yosemite was once a hub for the sport in the 1970s, BASE jumping has been banned in national parks since the 1980s. The activity, an acronym for Building, Antenna, Span and Earth, involves jumping from fixed objects with a parachute. It has been linked to numerous injuries, fatalities and risky rescue operations, endangering both jumpers and emergency personnel.\n\nViolators can face fines up to $5,000 or jail time under federal law. Offenders also risk losing their equipment and can be banned from park lands. Despite the ban, enthusiasts have continued to jump in secret, often at dawn or dusk to avoid detection.\n\nSQUATTERS TAKE OVER YOSEMITE AS SHUTDOWN LEAVES POPULAR NATIONAL PARK WITH FEW RANGERS: REPORT\n\nIn recent weeks, several videos and images circulating on social media appear to show BASE jumpers leaping from El Capitan, unauthorized campers occupying closed areas and climbers scaling Half Dome's cables without permits -- all in violation of park regulations.\n\nWhile the number of federal employees currently working at Yosemite during the government shutdown remains unclear, the NPS contingency plan states that essential staff will continue duties related to law enforcement and emergency response.\n\nThe Department of the Interior (DOI), which oversees the NPS, told Fox News Digital it is aware of reports of illegal activity and is investigating.\n\n\"We are aware of reports of BASE jumping in Yosemite and investigate all reports,\" a department spokesperson said. \"BASE jumping is illegal in all national parks, including Yosemite, due to the significant safety risks it poses to participants, the public and first responders.\"\n\nThe department emphasized that, despite the shutdown, the National Park Service will continue to keep parks as accessible as possible during the lapse in appropriations.\n\nTHOUSANDS OF ILLEGAL HIDDEN MARIJUANA PLANTS REMOVED FROM NATIONAL PARK ALONG WITH GUN, DANGEROUS CHEMICALS\n\n\"Critical functions that protect life, property and public health will remain in place, including visitor access in many locations, law enforcement and emergency response,\" the spokesperson said. \"We have 100% of our law enforcement rangers on duty. They are highly trained and, as in any other year at this time, are handling both front-country and backcountry patrols as needed.\"\n\nThe DOI said Yosemite continues to see normal seasonal visitation levels and that law enforcement rangers are responding to incidents as they normally would. Since the start of the shutdown, there have been three reported and documented BASE jumping complaints, which remain under active investigation.\n\nThe department also noted that the use of unmanned aircraft, or drones, is prohibited in Yosemite without a special permit. Violations can result in fines of up to $5,000 or six months in jail.\n\nOfficials said drone violations have increased in recent years, driven by the availability of consumer models. In response, Yosemite has expanded signage at entrances and visitor areas to remind the public of these restrictions. During the current shutdown, there have been sporadic reports of unauthorized drone use, and law enforcement rangers are responding as normal.\n\nThe DOI disputed some recent claims circulating online about deteriorating park conditions.\n\nYOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK RANGER REPORTEDLY FIRED AFTER DRAPING MASSIVE TRANS PRIDE FLAG ACROSS EL CAPITAN\n\n\"Our on-the-ground teams confirm that these reports do not accurately reflect current operations or visitor conditions,\" the spokesperson said. \"There has been no increase in vandalism, trash buildup or visitor misconduct unique to the shutdown period. Visitor cooperation and volunteer stewardship remain strong, and we appreciate the public's continued care for these sites.\"\n\nThe department added that it is \"proud of the dedicated employees and partners who continue to serve the public during this challenging time,\" and said teams are \"working hard to keep parks accessible, safe and welcoming.\"\n\n\"Like many across the federal government, we look forward to a resolution that allows all staff to return to work supporting the park's mission,\" the statement added.\n\nThe latest convictions, which were announced on Friday, stem from three separate cases between 2020 and 2024, including one involving a serious injury.\n\nThis was Nunn's second conviction for illegal BASE jumping; he previously pleaded guilty to a similar offense in 1998.\n\nINTERIOR DEPARTMENT ADOPTS NO-TOLERANCE POLICY FOR HOMELESS ENCAMPMENTS IN WASHINGTON, DC\n\nConservation advocates say the incidents reflect a larger pattern of disorder that can arise when national parks operate without full staffing.\n\nDuring the 2018-2019 shutdown, Yosemite and other parks suffered vandalism, illegal off-roading and waste accumulation that took months to repair, according to park advocates.\n\n\"This is exactly what we warned about. And this is why national parks need to be closed until the government re-opens,\" Emily Thompson, executive director of the Coalition to Protect America's National Parks, said in a previous statement. \"This shutdown is making an already bad situation at national parks and public lands far worse. The situation is dangerous and reckless for our parks, public lands and the visitors who love them.\"\n\nThe coalition, made up of more than 40 former NPS leaders, has urged Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to close all 433 park sites during any lapse in federal funding, citing ongoing staffing shortages.\n\nCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"Leaving national parks open without National Park staff to help protect visitors and resources is not only irresponsible -- it's dangerous. We don't leave museums open without curators, or airports without air traffic controllers and we should not leave our National Parks open without NPS employees,\" Thompson wrote.\n\nYosemite typically welcomes about four million visitors each year, with roughly three-quarters arriving between May and October, according to the National Park Service. During the current funding lapse, the Interior Department's contingency plan says parks will offer only basic services using retained recreation fees, while law enforcement and emergency operations continue.\"\n\nFox News Digital reached out to California Gov.

Gavin Newsom on Wednesday at 8:30 p.m. ET on ABC News Live and streaming on Disney+ and Hulu.\n\nTrump has mused several times about running for president again, including as recently as Monday, when he told reporters on Air Force One that he would \"love to do it\" despite it being barred by the Constitution.\n\nThe 22nd Amendment expressly forbids a president from being elected to office more than twice.\n\nLast week, Steve Bannon, the former Trump White House adviser and conservative media provocateur, said in an interview with The Economist that \"there's a plan\" and Trump \"is going to get a third term\" though he didn't share any details.\n\nHere's a transcript of the exchange between Newsom and Karl in the interview that will air on Wednesday in which Newsom talks about his meeting with Trump in the Oval Office in February.\n\nKARL: \"Bannon is talking Trump running again 2028 and you said Trump was talking about his fourth term?\"\n\nNEWSOM: \"He was showing me a photo of -- I turned around, he was at the Resolute [Desk], and he goes, 'Look over there.'

Do you think he is going to try to stay in office?\"\n\nNEWSOM: \"What I've noticed, what we all have experienced, I hope we're absorbing in our souls, because we're talking about the soul of America, is, I don't think he takes himself seriously, but he iterates. He throws things out. And he plays with it, and he sees how people react, and it manifests. Meaning, once a mind is stretched, it never goes back to its original form. And that's my concern. The more we're talking about this -- and we need to be. Look at what he's doing with masked agents. Look what he's doing federalizing the Guard. Look what he's doing to intimidate and voter suppression. Look what he's going to do with the DOJ. Look what he's trying to do to rig the elections: North Carolina, Missouri, down there, next Florida, not just in Texas. Look what he's doing in terms of the $230 million that is, apparently, his from his DOJ. All the pardoning, all the this -- this great grift, the biggest, most corrupt administration in history. Not just the $400 million plane, but the billion dollars of your tax money as we're cutting food stamps to pay for the damn plane so he can take that toy home with his foundation when he's 93 or whatever he's done with his fourth or fifth term.

(iStock)\n\nWith the nation's primary anti-hunger program on the verge of running out of money, a group of 23 Democratic attorneys general sued the Agriculture Department on Tuesday to force it to make billions of dollars in contingency funds available to help feed the most vulnerable individuals and families.\n\nSNAP, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program commonly known as food stamps, needs $9.2 billion to pay benefits in November. The Trump administration has said there's no money for next month because of the government shutdown, which started Oct. 1 and doesn't appear close to ending.\n\nUSDA has $5.5 billion on hand in contingency funds for the program, enough to cover more than half of the month's costs, but it cannot pay them, a senior administration official told The Washington Post on Monday.\n\nThat money is meant to be held in case of natural disasters or other catastrophes, not used to cover for a lapse in government funding, said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nBut the state attorneys general argue in their lawsuit that withholding the contingency funds violates federal spending laws and that the administration should be required to disburse the money, even if it covers only partial payments for the month.\n\nAround 42 million people rely on SNAP benefits each month; the average benefit is $332 per household, according to federal data.\n\n\"Millions of Americans are about to go hungry because the federal government has chosen to withhold food assistance it is legally obligated to provide,\" New York Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement. \"There is no excuse for this administration to abandon families who rely on SNAP, or food stamps, as a lifeline. The federal government must do its job to protect families.\"\n\nThe federal government pays the full cost of SNAP benefits, meaning states do not have a budget to fund the mass-scale program, though states do implement the payments. If benefits lapse Saturday, it would mark the first time in the program's 60-year history where the federal government fails to make the food-assistance payments because of a pause in appropriations.\n\nIn a memo to states sent Friday, USDA officials argued that \"contingency funds are not legally available to cover regular benefits.\"\n\n\"It has never been used to complement benefits,\" the senior administration official said. \"We've never had a lapse in appropriations like this. It's something that has not been tested, but precedent is for times of disaster.\"\n\nDuring previous shutdowns, USDA said states could use the contingency fund to pay for SNAP, including during the longest-ever closure, which ran from December 2018 into January 2019 in the first Trump administration. At that time, the administration told states through USDA memos that they could access the funds to pay for SNAP.\n\nA USDA spokesperson, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of agency policy, said Democrats were responsible for the looming crisis.\n\n\"We are approaching an inflection point for Senate Democrats,\" the spokesperson said in a statement. \"Continue to hold out for the Far-Left wing of the party or reopen the government so mothers, babies, and the most vulnerable among us can receive timely WIC and SNAP allotments.\"\n\nWIC payments, which go to low-income families and children under 5, are continuing despite the shutdown, funded by tariff revenue under a long-standing provision in the law.\n\nEven though USDA has said it will not refund states for sending food-assistance payments to residents if SNAP funding is halted, some states have made plans to keep funds flowing regardless. In New York, for example, Gov. Kathy Hochul (D) allocated $30 million for food aid and $11 million for food banks and pantries as a stopgap effort. But the funds don't cover even a week of what the state typically distributes in monthly SNAP benefits -- which regularly total about $650 million.\n\nOther governors, like California's Gavin Newsom (D), have said they will help their states' food banks as they struggle with extra demand caused by the missing payments. Other states, however, have not yet presented a stopgap plan.\n\nLawmakers from both sides of the aisle have raised the alarm over SNAP funding cuts. Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Missouri) introduced legislation meant to keep SNAP funded next month. The bill is co-sponsored by 10 other Republicans and one Democrat, Sen. Peter Welch (Vermont). In an X post announcing the bill, Hawley blamed Democrats for the potential lapse in funding, saying it could happen because they \"REFUSE to fund the government.\"\n\nBut Democrats blame Republicans and President Donald Trump for the uncertainty, accusing them of holding food stamps hostage. Democratic Sen. Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n, who represents New Mexico, the state with the highest SNAP participation rate, said that the shutdown has not stopped Trump from sending tens of billions of dollars to \"his political allies in Argentina,\" or $300 million to build the White House ballroom.\n\n\"But when it comes to feeding our fellow Americans, his administration is choosing to play politics,\" Luj\u00e1n said in a statement. \"The administration must release the available SNAP funds immediately to ensure millions of Americans don't go hungry.\"\n\nThe administration has also moved money around to cover other spending during the shutdown, including pay for military personnel and law enforcement agents in the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nAdvocates and experts have voiced skepticism over the legality of the USDA memo blocking states from accessing the contingency funds.\n\n\"This is unprecedented,\" said Gina Plata-Nino, the interim SNAP director at the Food Research and Action Center, arguing that Congress has not withdrawn the funds and that until those are repealed, the agency can't block states from accessing them.\n\nThe memo, she said, \"is not a policy memo. It looks more like a political memo.\"\n\n\"The [Congress] archive still says that they could use contingency funding in order to ensure that SNAP benefits are not delayed,\" she said.", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/10/28/snap-payments-shutdown-lawsuit-trump/"}

They intend to replace it with one that would give them at least nine House seats.\n\nTo do so, Democratic lawmakers would have to pass legislation to put a replacement map on the ballot. They would have to re-pass that legislation in their regular session early next year, then rush the measure to voters in a special election to approve the new map for use in November 2026.\n\nThose who fought hard for bipartisan commissions to take the politics out of redistricting have been disheartened by how quickly the commitment crumbled when the politics got rough.\n\n\"This is an arms race to the bottom,\" said Brian Cannon, who helped lead Virginia's effort to establish a commission. \"President Trump got it going with Texas, and [California Gov.] Gavin Newsom followed, and now we are seeing the ripple effects across the country.\"\n\nVirginia Democrats would be overriding a map imposed by the Virginia Supreme Court, which acted after the state's bipartisan commission failed to agree on a map after the 2020 census.\n\nOne after the other\n\nThe commonwealth is following California, whose Legislature is also controlled by Democrats and where voters are being asked to approve a similar referendum to scrap their commission-drawn lines in favor of a map that could nearly wipe Republicans out of the state's 52-seat delegation.\n\nCalifornia said it is responding to Texas, whose GOP-controlled Legislature redrew its lines to secure up to five new House seats for Republicans.\n\nRepublican-led Missouri has also redrawn its lines, and Republicans in Indiana will attempt to draw a new map next month.\n\nUsually, maps are drawn only once after each census. But mid-decade redistricting is not unheard of. Ohio redrew its lines seven times from 1876 to 1892, changing as control of the Legislature flipped back and forth.\n\nWhat makes this year different is the move to overturn the bipartisan commissions that were all the rage over the last two decades, particularly in blue states.\n\nRep. Morgan Griffith, a Republican who previously served in Virginia's House of Delegates, noted that nearly two-thirds of voters in his state approved the commission system in 2020.\n\n\"To come in now in the middle of an election and say, 'we want to change the rules because non-partisanship does not suit your current partisan needs' -- that's wrong,\" Mr. Griffin said. \"It's just, it's just brazen partisan politics in a process that the voters of Virginia overwhelmingly approved.\"\n\nVirginia state Delegate Lee Ware, a Republican, criticized the partisan push, arguing Monday on the floor of the House of Delegates that it runs counter to the commonwealth's political traditions.\n\n\"Candor requires admitting that this bad idea of mid-decade redistricting did get its 2025 launch by the president,\" Mr. Ware said. \"However, just because a bad idea was proposed and even taken up by a few of our sister states, such as North Carolina or California, is not a reason for Virginia to follow suit.\"\n\nHe concluded with a sharp rebuke: \"In short, it is to belatedly attach Virginia to the tail of a bandwagon that is unworthy of her history and unworthy of this body's long heritage.\"\n\nA week before statewide elections, Virginia's redistricting has spilled over into the governor's race.\n\nDemocratic nominee Abigail Spanberger, a former member of Congress and polling frontrunner, has appeared to shift her stance from initially declaring she had \"no plans to redistrict Virginia\" to now expressing openness to the initiative advanced by the Democrat-controlled General Assembly.\n\nLt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, the Republican nominee who has consistently backed the independent redistricting commission, chastised the special session and the Democrats' motivations.\n\nMeanwhile, the special session has disrupted the plans of state delegates seeking re-election, forcing them to return to Richmond during what would have been their final full week of campaigning before Election Day.\n\n'A break-glass moment'\n\nMr. Trump looms large over Democrats' reversal on redistricting, said Stephen J. Farnsworth, a political science professor at the University of Mary Washington.\n\n\"Remember, Democrats are looking at the fact that Donald Trump, even now, refuses to accept that he lost the 2020 election,\" Mr. Farnsworth said. \"The world is very different when you think about the way that both parties accepted whether they won or lost elections before 2020.\"\n\nHe also said Democrats now feel the commissions amount to \"unilateral disarmament\" in the face of GOP gains in Texas.\n\nMr. Cooper, who pushed the commission idea in Virginia, said even some of those he worked with are now embracing the overturn effort because having Mr. Trump in office with a GOP-led Congress is too much.\n\n\"For them, this is a break-glass moment for all sorts of reasons,\" he said.\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican who as governor of California led the push for that state's commission, was dismayed by his state's reversal.\n\n\"You know, Texas started it. They did something terribly wrong, and then all of a sudden, California says, 'Well, then we have to do something terribly wrong,'\" he said on CNN's \"State of the Union\" over the weekend.\n\nMr. Schwarzenegger dismissed the notion that the changes would be short-lived, arguing advocates would \"find an excuse\" to make revised maps permanent.\n\nPolls show the California measure is poised to pass.\n\nBut the jury is out on Democrats' effort in Virginia, where they hold a narrow 21-19 majority in the state Senate and a 51-48 majority in the state House.\n\nThe change could also face legal hurdles. The state's constitution requires that ballot referendums be approved by the Legislature in two separate sessions, with an intervening election.\n\nRepublicans argue that the current election cycle is already underway, with early voting beginning on Sept. 19, so the measure couldn't be put to voters until after next November.", "url": "https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2025/oct/28/redistricting-reversal-virginia-democrats-move-ditch-bipartisan-map/"}

Rural voters would be outnumbered, making it unlikely for a Republican candidate to prevail.\n\n\"Most of us see it as, you know, just massive gerrymandering, taking what little representation that we had away and now we'll have absolutely nothing,\" Patrick Jones, a former Shasta County supervisor, said in a recent interview in his family's gun shop.\n\nVoting concludes Nov. 4 on the measure, which would create partisan U.S. House maps outside of normal once-a-decade redistricting handled by an independent commission. It's an effort by Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom to counter a Trump-backed plan in Texas to gain five more Republican seats. He says it's necessary to defend democracy, but California Republicans call it a power grab that will disenfranchise voters. Republicans currently hold nine of the state's 52 congressional seats.\n\nIn Redding, one of the largest cities north of Sacramento, bright yellow signs urging residents to defend fair elections and rural representation dot the highway. A local man recently led a one-person protest in front of City Hall, while more than 150 others showed up at a rally to reject what they see as a scheme by Democrats to take away their voices.\n\nThey face an uphill battle in the state where registered Democrats outnumber Republicans by nearly 2-to-1. Democrats have returned nearly twice as many ballots. Labor unions and other Democratic allies have mobilized hundreds of volunteers to reach voters in solidly blue areas like Los Angeles with millions of voters. Two weeks before Election Day, just about 7,000 ballots had been returned in Shasta County, county clerk Clint Curtis said. He expects lower turnout than normal.\n\nTV advertising opposing the measure -- a key investment in the sprawling state -- has largely dried up.\n\nUnder the new maps, voters in Shasta, Siskiyou and Modoc counties -- all conservative strongholds in the rural north -- would be in the same congressional district with Marin County, which sits just across the Golden Gate Bridge from San Francisco.\n\nMr. LaMalfa's current district includes farms that grow rice, olive and other tree nuts, and ranching is prevalent in the farthest northern reaches. Lassen National Volcanic Park, historic Shasta Dam and snow-capped Mt. Shasta are defining features. Redding has a population under 100,000. Distrust of government and belief in election conspiracies are common. In 2024, 67% of voters in Shasta County supported Mr. Trump.\n\nMarin County, meanwhile, went 80% for Democrat Kamala Harris. The median household income tops $140,000 -- roughly double that of Shasta County. It's part of a district that runs north up the Pacific coastline to Oregon and is known for redwood forests, wine production and cannabis farms. It's represented by Democratic Rep. Jared Huffman.\n\nMr. LaMalfa, a rice farmer, opposes the proposition and has spent at least $63,000 from his campaign fund to reach voters through text messages and yard signs. He also gave $50,000 to a statewide \"no\" campaign.\n\nMr. LaMalfa's supporters say they appreciate his conservative stances and push for an important new water storage project.\n\n\"I pretty much love the guy,\" said Bob Braz, a Redding area native who owns a bait shop. \"I stand for almost all the things that he's done.\"\n\nThose who don't know much about Mr. LaMalfa's record said they trust him because of his background.\n\n\"I don't hear much about him but he's a farmer,\" said Liz Jacobs, who moved from the Bay Area to Redding 20 years ago. She added: \"I don't know about somebody from the Bay Area with their progressive ideas.\"\n\nMr. Newsom and other Democrats say the measure is a tool to fight Mr. Trump's agenda and counter Republican efforts to pick up seats elsewhere. Even if it passes and Democrats win five more seats, it may not help the party retain the House. Republicans in Missouri, North Carolina and Indiana are joining Texas in trying to draw more winnable seats in the 2026 midterms. Lawmakers in Virginia, meanwhile, are back in session to work on a map more friendly to Democrats. All of the efforts are sure to face legal challenges.\n\n\"This is not the fight we want to fight. This was not our battle,\" Mr. Newsom said recently. \"This is in reaction to something unprecedented that happened.\"\n\nBut voters in Redding see it as another way to silence their voices.\n\nThey have long felt neglected by the Democratic-controlled Legislature in Sacramento, which they blame for raising the cost of living and infringing on local control. Lawmakers, for example, banned counties from hand-counting ballots in most cases after Shasta County leaders voted to get rid of their vote-counting machines in 2023.\n\nSome said they worry that national Republicans won't put up a fight to hold the seats if the measure passes.\n\n\"You would have to spend a huge amount of money to reach your base,\" said Mr. Jones, the former county supervisor. \"And they're just simply not going to want to waste that amount of money because it would be better spent throughout the country elsewhere.\"", "url": "https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2025/oct/28/gop-voters-northern-california-prepare-loss-representation-fight-us/"}

We're thinking, 'Okay. In the long run, these volumes will go back up to what they were pre-COVID conditions or just go back to regular volumes, and we'll be back in business.' But what happened? The complete opposite happened,\" he said. \"They went down and stayed down, and we never knew, as truckers, what was the problem.\"\n\nWHITE HOUSE SAYS CALIFORNIA GRANTED LICENSE TO ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT TRUCKER CHARGED IN FATAL DUI CRASH\n\nNow, with recent revelations from the Trump Department of Transportation and Secretary Sean Duffy about rampant illegal alien truckers on American roads, Kucharski said the truth is finally out.\n\nDuffy issued a bombshell report on Thursday accusing California of violating federal law by issuing a commercial driver's license to a foreign asylum seeker whose semi-truck crash killed three people last week.\n\nThe report alleges that Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom's administration ignored a federal order to halt noncompliant licenses and revoke improperly issued credentials, a failure that, according to Duffy, cost \"three innocent souls.\"\n\nFederal regulators uncovered flaws in how California licenses were obtained by certain commercial truck drivers. The 2025 Annual Program Review and the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) concluded that the state's commercial driver's license (CDL) system suffered from \"systemic policy, procedural, and programming errors\" when it came to handling non-domiciled licenses.\n\nIn an audit letter dated Sept. 26, 2025, investigators also discovered that California had issued CDLs to non-domiciled drivers that were valid even after their federal work authorization expired.\n\nBLUE STATE INVESTIGATES HOW ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT TRUCKER GOT LICENSE BEFORE DEADLY FLORIDA CRASH\n\nKucharski explained further that, though a heavily regulated industry, illegal alien truck drivers can exploit a \"loophole\" in the system by obtaining non-domiciled commercial drivers' licenses from states such as California and New York. They are then able to outcompete legitimate trucking businesses by charging lower prices, leading to the demise of many American small businesses in the industry.\n\n\"As a business owner, I was thinking, 'Well, who is taking all these loads?' Now I could figure it out that this is another shockwave that's hitting the truck industry after COVID and violent volatility, these [non-domiciled] drivers are coming in and doing it for cheaper because they don't care, and ... they don't have social security numbers, and I assume they're probably not filing for taxes. So, if you're not going to pay all your bills, of course, you can do it cheaper and keep on trucking.\"\n\n\"All our truckers are fighting for the same load, and it goes to the lowest bidder,\" he went on. \"If you have these drivers coming in that are non-domiciled, they have no family here, they have no home, they live in their truck ... They're saying, 'Okay, look, all the market's doing for $2,000, we'll do it for $1,700.' So, it's putting small trucking businesses out of business every day.\"\n\n\"We're over-regulated, honestly, in the trucking industry. And if you're overregulated, you think, 'Well, there's no way that this could happen, and it is happening, right now as we speak,\" he said. \"It's eye-opening, disturbing and jaw-dropping.\"\n\nKucharski called on Duffy as well as other industry leaders to take action.\n\nAlong with the report last week, the U.S. Department of Transportation issued an emergency interim final rule that tightened standards for non-domiciled CDLs nationwide. In the rule, stipulations changed and limited eligibility to applicants holding certain employment-based visas. It requires every state to verify their legal status through the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE) database.\n\nUnder the new rule, any non-domiciled commercial learner's permit or CDL must expire no later than the end date on the driver's federal immigration record or after one year, whichever comes first. It also maintains that states must keep proof of their lawful presence on file for at least two years.\n\nILLEGAL IMMIGRANT TRUCK DRIVER IN FATAL CALIFORNIA CRASH SHOULD NEVER HAVE HAD LICENSE: DOT REPORT\n\nIn response to Kucharski's criticisms, a spokesperson for Newsom told Fox News Digital that \"California continues to follow federal rules regarding CDLs.\"\n\n\"Lost in the immigrant-bashing is the fact that drivers holding a California-issued CDL are involved in fatal crashes at a rate far lower than the national average. If the focus were on safety, California should be a poster child, not a scapegoat,\" the spokesperson said.\n\n\"Consistent with federal law, California issued commercial driver's licenses only to drivers if the federal government confirmed their legal presence,\" the spokesperson went on, adding, \"The Trump administration didn't like these federal rules and just recently changed them to restrict refugees, DACA holders, and others from being able to apply for a CDL.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"This is a very serious crisis issue,\" Kucharski said. \"The trucking industry depends on trust. That means ensuring every driver on the road is properly licensed, well-trained, and mentally and physically fit to operate heavy equipment.\"\n\n\"All I can say is strategies like this remind us that reform isn't just about policies, [its] about human lives. And it's on all of us, from the regulators to the fleet owners, to the driver trainers, to ensure the system works the way it should.\"\n\nFox News Digital also reached out to Hochul's office for comment but did not immediately receive a response.", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/politics/whistleblower-warns-illegal-immigrants-sending-shockwave-through-crucial-industry"}

He explained that while he does not believe such a horrific event could recur in America, those who endured it can recognize echoes of authoritarianism emerging under Trump's leadership.\n\nWallace added that equating Trump to Hitler is \"not a partisan analysis,\" recalling how current Vice President JD Vance once questioned whether Trump could be \"America's Hitler.\" She praised Pritzker for articulating a thoughtful argument about the troubling historical similarities between Trump's America and Nazi Germany.\n\nWHITE HOUSE RESPONDS TO LIBERAL PODCAST HOST CALLING STEPHEN MILLER A 'NAZI JEW'\n\n\"You put sort of the intellectual architecture behind the parallels that involve all of us, and you've talked about -- the first thing you said was 'people being asked for their papers,' American citizens being asked to show up with papers, street vendors being asked to produce passports, rounding people up, and good people looking the other way, thinking 'that's not about me.'

James Clyburn, D-S.C., has been comparing Trump to Hitler for years, including his first term, when he said, \"I can only equate one period of time with what we experience now, and that was what was going on in Germany around 1934, right after the 1932 elections when Adolf Hitler was elected chancellor.\"\n\nWhile he went on to relent and said that Italian dictator Benito Mussolini might be a better comparison, he has continually compared Trump's presidency to Hitler, such as when he spoke to Fox News host Neil Cavuto.\n\n\"Are you envisioning another Hitler?

He said the problem \"seems to be more pronounced with the brothers.\"\n\nMr. Obama scolded: \"And you are thinking about sitting out? Part of it makes me think -- and I'm speaking to men directly -- part of it makes me think that, well, you just aren't feeling the idea of having a woman as president, and you're coming up with other alternatives and other reasons for that.\"\n\nHe mansplained how \"women in our lives have been getting our backs this entire time,\" and \"When we get in trouble and the system isn't working for us, they're the ones out there marching and protesting.\"\n\nMr. Obama's pleas didn't move the needle for Ms. Harris. President Trump nearly doubled his support among Black voters in 2024 from his 2020 results, increasing from 5% to 10% among women and from 12% to 21% among men, according to a Pew Research analysis.\n\nInterestingly, Mr. Obama isn't making the same argument on behalf of Winsome Earle-Sears, a Black Republican and U.S. Marine Corps veteran running for Virginia governor. However, lacking a clear leader of the Democratic Party, Mr. Obama is stepping up his visibility in November's political races, believing he still has the influence to sway voters on the campaign trail.\n\nThat gamble may backfire. The hope and change Mr. Obama ran and won on in 2008 and 2012 didn't result in a better America.\n\nMr. Obama's signature health care achievement, the Affordable Care Act, continues to need repeated taxpayer bailouts because of its unaffordability. His focus on racial bias fostered an anti-police climate, which led to communities becoming less safe. His economic policies led to a slow recovery for many working- and middle-class families, stagnant wages and a drop in the labor force participation rate to its lowest point since the 1970s. Mr. Obama's foreign policy of \"leading from behind\" led to a more bellicose Iran and emboldened Russia to invade Ukraine.\n\nSince Mr. Obama's departure from political office, his speeches have become less inspiring and more condescending and patronizing. He consistently blames American voters for not recognizing his achievements or being able to move beyond their racial, sexist and moral biases. He wasn't able to boost Democratic turnout in 2024, yet he believes he can sway voters a year later.\n\nFour days ago, Mr. Obama joined California Gov. Gavin Newsom to promote California Democrats' redistricting effort. This Saturday, he is set to rally with Virginia's Democratic gubernatorial candidate, Abigail Spanberger, in Norfolk, and New Jersey's gubernatorial candidate, Mikie Sherrill, in Newark.\n\nMr. Obama has decided to enter a more \"political and public-facing role than he once envisioned\" this year, The Washington Post reported last week, because of the \"anxieties he harbors about Trump's second term.\"\n\n\"The ex-president has grown especially worried that some lawmakers and voters are not confronting Trump with the same urgency they showed during his first term -- and that major institutions, including universities and law firms, have too often capitulated to Trump's demands, said a person familiar with [Mr. Obama's] thinking,\" The Post reported.\n\nOn a podcast this month, Mr. Obama said Mr. Trump's policies have led to \"masked folks with rifles and machine guns patrolling our streets\" and \"kangaroo courts and trumped-up charges.\" He said there needed to be \"a few folks standing up and giving courage to other folks.\" He decried that the country is \"being tested right now\" and urged people to \"take a stand.\"\n\nRich, coming from Mr. Obama, who, during his tenure, targeted conservative organizations through the IRS, used the Espionage Act to put a record number of reporters' sources in jail and green-lit his intelligence agencies to investigate the 2016 Trump campaign's (phony) ties to Russia.\n\nInstead of building up a new generation of Democratic leaders, Mr. Obama's administration obliterated the party while he served in the White House. During his presidency, the Democratic Party lost a net total of 13 governorships and 816 state legislative seats, the most of any president since Dwight D. Eisenhower.\n\nSo, as a Republican, I welcome Mr. Obama's renewed presence in the public domain. He paved the way for Mr. Trump's ascendency but is still too arrogant, nearly a decade later, to even contemplate the thought.", "url": "https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2025/oct/27/obama-overestimates-political-sway/"}

She has previously written for The Daily Beast, Newsweek and amNewYork.\n\nIndiana's Republican governor on Monday said he would be calling a special session to consider redrawing the state's congressional map, following in the footsteps of other GOP states -- although the state Senate president cautioned that \"the votes still aren't there.\"\n\nGov. Mike Braun posted on X that he will be \"calling a special legislative session to protect Hoosiers from efforts in other states that seek to diminish their voice in Washington and ensure their representation in Congress is fair.\" He said the special session will work to conform \"Indiana's tax code with new federal tax provisions.\"\n\nThe session is set to start on Nov. 3 and by law it can only run for 30 session days, or 40 calendar days. Indiana currently has seven Republicans and two Democrats in Congress, and the Republicans are hoping to change the district lines to edge out the two Democrats.\n\nFiling for the 2026 midterm elections begins on Jan. 7 and closes on Feb. 6, with the primaries scheduled for May 5 -- which would give candidates only a few months to campaign under new district lines.\n\nRepublicans have a supermajority in both chambers, but Indiana Senate President Rodric Bray's office said in a statement Monday morning that \"the votes still aren't there for redistricting.\"\n\nSenate Democratic Leader Shelli Yoder said in a statement that Democrats will fight the \"illegitimate session with every tool, every vote and every ounce of moral clarity we have.\"\n\nPresident Trump won Indiana by 19 points, but there has been hesitation from Republican lawmakers on redrawing the state's congressional lines, which were set in 2021. Republican leaders have met with Mr. Trump at the White House, and Vice President JD Vance has visited Indiana at least twice and also met with Republican lawmakers in D.C.\n\nRepublicans have been seeking to redistrict in red states nationwide as Mr. Trump has tried to solidify the GOP majority in the House. Over the summer, Mr. Trump called on Texas Republicans to redraw their congressional maps to give the party up to five seats. That push garnered national attention, especially when Democrats in the state legislature fled the state to deny Republicans a quorum, dragging the issue into a second session until it eventually succeeded.\n\nIn response, California's Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, pushed an effort to redraw his state's congressional districts to garner up to five seats for Democrats. A new map was passed by the Democratic-controlled Assembly, and it now will go before voters on Nov. 4 as a ballot measure known as Proposition 50. A CBS News poll conducted between Oct. 16 and 21 found that 62% of California voters plan to support it.\n\nOther Republican-led states have taken on redistricting efforts, even though the net outcome would just be one seat in each state. Missouri lawmakers approved a new map in September to edge out longtime Democratic Rep. Emanuel Cleaver in Kansas City, and North Carolina followed earlier this month with the General Assembly passing a map intended to force out Rep. Don Davis.\n\nDemocrats have filed lawsuits against many of these efforts.", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/indiana-redistricting-special-session-republicans/"}

But these developments have also set off alarms among free speech advocates, as the Trump administration pushes to punish speech it dislikes and to impose its patriotic vision of American history on schools.\n\nAdam Laats, a historian of education at Binghamton University, noted that school curriculum had been restricted before, notably during the Red Scares of the last century. But the current political pressure is unique, he said: \"Never before has this kind of fervor from the right owned the Oval Office.\"\n\nAs recently as last year, many social studies teachers reported success in withstanding political pressure. Now, there is growing evidence that the landscape is shifting. In a September poll, more than half of the teachers who responded said that political pressure had caused them to modify their curriculums or classroom discussions, a sharp increase from March.\n\nChristopher Rufo, a conservative activist who has led the push for changes in education, said President Trump's return to office accelerated a cultural shift that was already underway. Over the last five years, more than 20 states have passed laws restricting classroom discussions on race, gender and American history.\n\n\"Even center-left Democrats are starting to pull away from left-wing ideologies they had endorsed a few years before,\" he said. \"The reason for this is quite simple. America has a center-right culture and the gap between the public and these elite ideologies became a political liability.\"\n\nLesson Plans Are Disappearing\n\nThis spring, as Brown University was under intense pressure from the Trump administration, it shuttered Choices, the university's 30-year-old high school social studies curriculum, overseen by its history department.\n\nChoices reached one million students annually, and was especially popular in advanced courses and at independent private schools. The program was known for bringing college-level concepts into high schools and for lesson plans that were rich in primary sources, on topics from the American Revolution to the riot at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nAfter the start of the Israel-Hamas War in 2023 and the rise of the pro-Palestinian campus protest movement -- which was heavily active at Brown -- Choices was scrutinized by advocacy groups supportive of Israel. Critics argued that a unit on the Middle East fed antisemitism by focusing on Israel's occupation of Palestinian land and downplaying Palestinian terrorism against Israelis.\n\nNow Choices materials have largely been wiped from the internet.\n\nBrown had been reconsidering Choices since the summer of 2024 for budgetary reasons. The final decision to shutter the program was made this past spring, as Brown faced a potential federal funding freeze. The White House eventually moved to withhold $510 million in grants, accusing Brown of allowing antisemitism to fester during campus protests. (The university has since made a deal with the government to restore its funding.)\n\nBrian Clark, a Brown spokesman, said the closure of Choices was based \"exclusively\" on the program's financial outlook, and had nothing to do with debates over its content or pressure from the White House. He acknowledged in an email, however, that the market for Choices materials had weakened, in part because of \"recent pressures to eliminate curricula that consider race, gender, colonialism, etc.\"\n\nBrown decided not to allow other publishers to acquire Choices lesson plans, according to internal communications reviewed by The New York Times. It also declined to maintain the Choices archives on the university's website, and refused to allow the program's staff to distribute over $200,000 worth of lesson plans that had already been printed.\n\nDoing so would have created \"legal and financial exposure,\" Mr. Clark said.\n\nHigh school teachers, worried about losing access to materials that they relied on for years, have used social media to circulate some Choices units.\n\nAnother group that has withdrawn curriculum is the Anti-Defamation League, a nonprofit that historically focused on antisemitism and a broad range of other civil rights issues, while also strongly supporting Israel. The A.D.L.'s educational resources reach more than 1.6 million students annually, according to Todd Gutnick, a spokesman for the group.\n\nOver the past two years, the A.D.L. has removed dozens of lesson plans from its website, according to a review of archived web content. Some were about transgender identity, sexism against women who have run for president and sexist tropes in video games.\n\nThe deleted lessons also included several that dealt with police violence against Black men, one on microaggressions, and a lesson on Frederick Douglass and voting rights.\n\nIn a written statement, Mr. Gutnick said that some of the lessons had been retired and others were \"temporarily removed\" for revisions.\n\nA statement on the A.D.L.'s website says the group is choosing to focus its educational resources on antisemitism, the Holocaust and Jewish identity. \"While we are no longer hosting many of our broader anti-bias resources, we remain deeply committed to fostering inclusive school communities,\" it states.\n\nLast year, the group phased out a 40-year-old program for schools called A World of Difference Institute, which sought to \"actively challenge prejudice, stereotyping and all forms of discrimination.\"\n\nThe A.D.L. continues to offer No Place for Hate, an anti-bullying curriculum that includes material on identity-based bias.\n\nTeachers Are Avoiding Basic Civics\n\nThe organization iCivics was founded by Sandra Day O'Connor, the former Supreme Court justice, to provide free, nonpartisan curriculum materials. The group estimates that its lessons reach about nine million students annually.\n\nThis fall, though, staff members noted a significant decline -- up to 28 percent -- in the number of page views recorded for some popular lessons, including those dealing with separation of powers, consent of the governed and other constitutional principles.\n\niCivics does not yet have a full picture of why this is happening.\n\nBut Emma Humphries, the group's chief education officer, said that in her travels across the country to train teachers, many have said they were fearful of having classroom discussions veer into politically fraught territory -- like questions from students about why Mr. Trump appeared to be violating constitutional norms.\n\nSocial studies teachers typically receive much less training from their school districts than teachers of English and math, the subjects covered by state tests. As a result, some teachers may have had little guidance on how to tackle controversial topics.\n\nFurther complicating matters, many teachers work in states that have adopted broadly written laws that limit what can be said in the classroom.\n\niCivics offers training in how to teach students about American government without walking into political minefields, including by using primary sources like the Constitution and Supreme Court rulings. Dr. Humphries said teachers should explain to students that questions like the limits of presidential power have been debated for centuries, and that presidents from all parties have tried to stretch the limits to increase their authority.\n\n\"The concern is that teachers will avoid certain topics altogether, or just revert to boring pedagogy, like reading the textbook the district approved,\" she said. \"That is not a good way to teach. The kids deserve better than that, and our democracy deserves better.\"\n\nA Democratic-Led State Shifts Right\n\nCalifornia was once a leader in adopting a left-leaning approach to social studies. In 2021, Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a law requiring all high school students to take a course in ethnic studies, an activist discipline that focuses on the histories and cultures of Latinos, Black Americans, Asian Americans and Native Americans. Ethnic studies lessons often criticize settler colonialism, naming Israel as the prime contemporary example.\n\nResearch has shown that ethnic studies classes can raise attendance and grades for students who are at risk of dropping out.\n\nBut after some Jewish groups mounted a legal and political fight against ethnic studies -- saying its critiques of Israel were fostering antisemitism -- the consensus around the state's mandate unraveled. This spring, Mr. Newsom presented and signed a budget that did not include funding for the classes. Districts are not currently required to offer the course, according to the state board of education.\n\nIn some school systems that are continuing to offer ethnic studies, there are new restrictions. San Francisco teachers must use a single textbook that does not discuss the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Supplemental materials must be approved by administrators.\n\nMr. Newsom signed two bills this month that were intended to prevent antisemitism and other forms of discrimination in schools. The laws establish a state office to handle complaints, and require teachers to abstain from \"advocacy, opinion, bias or partisanship\" in the classroom.\n\nTeachers' unions, the American Civil Liberties Union and Muslim groups raised concerns about the potential for chilled speech and increased litigation. But the bills passed unanimously in the heavily Democratic legislature.\n\nMr. Rufo, the conservative activist, argued that the new laws do not threaten free speech, noting that public-school teachers do not have a legal right to academic freedom in their classrooms.\n\nKairi Hand, a 15-year-old sophomore at Burton Academic High School in San Francisco, said ethnic studies had been a favorite course. Israel was not a focus in her class, she recalled. What stayed with her, she said, were lessons on the Chinese Exclusion Act and the way in which the Disney movie \"Pocahontas\" differed from the true history of English encounters with Indigenous Americans.\n\nShe also understood why the class was controversial. \"There is a lot of controversy going on in the whole world. Especially,\" she said, \"things taught in schools.\"", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/27/us/history-lessons-ethnic-studies-retreat.html"}

Newsom has also led a campaign to redraw California's own maps to add five Democratic U.S. House seats in response to the changes in Texas. Voting is underway on the so-called Proposition 50 and concludes Nov. 4.\n\n\"I'm looking forward to who presents themselves in 2028 and who meets that moment. And that's the question for the American people,\" he said in the interview that aired Sunday.\n\nThe feud between Trump and Newsom does not seem like it's going away anytime soon. On Thursday, Trump acknowledged he had agreed to halt a planned show of federal force planned for this weekend in San Francisco after appeals from tech executives and the mayor. Newsom was mayor of San Francisco between 2004 and 2011.\n\nIn the interview, Newsom described Trump as an \"invasive species.\"\n\n\"He's a wrecking ball. Not just the symbolism and substance of the East Wing,\" Newsom said, referring to the demolition of that part of the White House to build a ballroom. \"He's wrecking alliances, truth, trust, tradition, institutions.\"\n\nEarlier this year, Newsom launched a podcast in an effort to brand himself as a centrist. During the show, he has held conversations with influential figures all across the political spectrum, from late conservative Charlie Kirk, who was assassinated on a college campus tour, as well as former Trump strategist Steve Bannon, to Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, who was former Vice President Kamala Harris' 2024 running mate, and U.S. Rep.

Gavin Newsom has refused to comply with U.S. Department of Transportation rules that require the state to stop issuing such licenses and review those already issued.\n\n\"So, one, I'm about to pull $160 million from California,\" Duffy said. \"And, as we pull more money, we also have the option of pulling California's ability to issue commercial driver's licenses.\"\n\nNewsom's press office did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment on the matter Sunday, but California has defended its practices previously. When Duffy threatened to revoke funds last month, a spokesperson for Newsom dismissed the attack and noted that CDL holders from California have a significantly lower rate of crashes than both the national average and the Texas average, which is the only state with more licensed commercial drivers.\n\nLast month, the Transportation Department tightened commercial driver's license requirements for noncitizens after three fatal crashes that officials said were caused by immigrant truck drivers. Only three specific classes of visa holders will be eligible for CDLs under the new rules and states must verify an applicant's immigration status in a federal database. The licenses will be valid for up to one year unless the applicant's visa expires sooner.\n\nDuffy said last month that California should never have issued 25% of 145 licenses investigators reviewed. He cited four California licenses that remained valid after the driver's work permit expired -- sometimes years after. The state had 30 days to come up with a plan to comply or lose funding.\n\nA nationwide commercial driver's license audit began after officials say a driver in the country illegally made a U-turn and caused a crash in Florida that killed three people. It found licenses that were issued improperly in California, Colorado, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Texas and Washington.\n\nDuffy said Sunday that California has unlawfully issued tens of thousands of these licenses to noncitizens.\n\n\"So you have 60,000 people on the roads who shouldn't have licenses,\" Duffy said. \"They're driving fuel tankers, they're driving school buses, and we have seen some of the crashes on American roadways that come from these people who shouldn't have these licenses.\"\n\nDuffy said earlier this month that he would withhold $40 million from California because it is the only state that is failing to enforce English language requirements for truckers. California defended its practices in a formal response to the Transportation Department, but federal officials were not satisfied.\n\nThe investigation launched after the Florida crash found what Duffy called significant failures in the way California is enforcing rules that took effect in June after one of President Donald Trump's executive orders. California had issued the driver a commercial license, but these English rules predate the crash.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/transportation-secretary-hell-pull-160m-california-noncitizen-truck-126881595"}

Gavin Newsom of California, who has positioned himself as one of President Trump's most visible Democratic antagonists, said on Sunday he will consider running for president after the 2026 midterm elections.\n\nMr. Newsom, a Democrat, has long been considered a potential candidate for 2028 by many political observers. But on \"CBS News Sunday Morning,\" he addressed the issue more directly when he was asked whether he would give a presidential run serious thought after the midterms.\n\n\"Yeah,\" he said, adding that saying otherwise, \"I'd just be lying, and I can't do that.\" The interview was taped on Thursday in San Jose, according to CBS.\n\nMr. Newsom is currently serving in his second term as governor, which ends in January 2027, and is not eligible for re-election. He has acted as a foil to Trump administration policies and political maneuvering, pushing back against the presence of federal troops in Los Angeles, leading the effort to redraw the state's congressional maps to counter similar Republican efforts in Texas and even mocking the president's social media style.\n\nHis remarks on Sunday were not the first indication Mr. Newsom could run in 2028. In July, he met with Democratic voters in South Carolina, a pivotal primary state, which some saw as an early attempt to lay the groundwork for a run.\n\nIn the CBS interview, Mr. Newsom said he enjoyed that trip to South Carolina. \"I'm in the right business,\" he said. \"I love people.\"\n\nBut Mr. Newsom, who was one of President Joseph R. Biden's strongest allies on the 2024 campaign trail, made it clear that nothing was set in stone.\n\n\"I'm looking forward to who presents themselves in 2028 and who meets that moment,\" he said. \"That's the question for the American people.\"\n\nThe Democratic field for the next presidential race is still a long way from taking shape, but ambitious politicians with eyes on 2028 are beginning to make the kinds of trips that feel out, or potentially set up, official announcements.\n\nAnd at least two other party figures have acknowledged that they could be running in 2028.\n\nRahm Emanuel, the former Chicago mayor who served as the Biden administration's ambassador to Japan, is weighing a run.\n\nAnd former Vice President Kamala Harris suggested in an interview aired on Saturday that she was considering running again after falling short in 2024.\n\n\"I am not done,\" she told the BBC.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/26/us/politics/gavin-newsom-2028-race.html"}

Arnold Schwarzenegger expressed deep concern over the growing trend of partisan redistricting across the United States, calling it a troubling shift from democratic principles.\n\nDuring an appearance on CNN's \"State of the Union,\" Mr. Schwarzenegger lamented that political parties are now focused on trying to cheat their way to victory rather than winning the battle of ideas.\n\n\"There's this war going on all over the United States. Who can out-cheat the other one?\" Mr. Schwarzenegger, a Republican, said Sunday from Gold's Gym in Venice, California. \"You know, Texas started it. They did something terribly wrong, and then all of a sudden, California says, 'Well, then we have to do something terribly wrong.'\"\n\n\"Now other states are jumping in, and now this is spreading like wildfire all over the country, and it saddens me to see that we're going in the opposite direction, rather than having an independent commission draw the district lines,\" he said.\n\nMr. Schwarzenegger, an actor who championed the creation of California's independent redistricting commission in 2008, has spoken out against recent efforts to redraw congressional maps for partisan advantage -- including those unfolding in his own state.\n\nThe redistricting battle began after President Trump pressed the Republican-led Texas Legislature to redraw its maps to add as many as five Republican seats, viewing it as key to defending the slim Republican majority in the midterm elections next year.\n\nIn response, California Democrats, led by Gov. Gavin Newsom, have proposed Proposition 50 -- also known as the Election Rigging Response Act.\n\nThe ballot measure, set for a vote this fall, would temporarily unwind part of the Schwarzenegger legacy by authorizing changes to the state's congressional maps in hopes of gaining five seats for Democrats.\n\n\"This is a revolution that's going on in real time in our country,\" Mr. Newson recently said. \"We need to wake up. Prop 50 is foundational if we're going to save this republic.\"\n\n\"So I would say to those that are opposed to it, wake up to these spare me the moral high ground,\" he said.\n\nPublic polls suggest the proposal is poised to pass.\n\nRepublicans in North Carolina and Missouri have also adopted new maps.\n\nVirginia could be next. Democrats have called a special session this week where they are expected to jumpstart the legislative process on a referendum question that would go to voters next year.\n\nMr. Schwarzenegger said he is skeptical of claims that California's proposed changes would be temporary.\n\nAlthough the referendum states the new maps would expire after the 2030 elections, he warned that such promises rarely hold.\n\n\"They're going to say, wait a minute, there's still gerrymandering going on in Texas. There's still gerrymandering going on in Ohio. There's still gerrymandering going on in Florida. We have to continue with the gerrymandering,\" he said. \"This is what's going to happen. They will find an excuse. So, therefore, I don't think it is temporary.\"", "url": "https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2025/oct/26/arnold-schwarzenegger-ex-ca-gov-criticizes-nationwide-surge/"}

Gavin Newsom, who has become one of President Trump's most high-profile adversaries, told \"CBS News Sunday Morning\" in an exclusive interview that he will consider whether to run for president after the 2026 midterm elections.\n\nIn an interview taped Thursday in San Jose, Newsom was asked whether he would give \"serious thought\" to a White House bid once next year's midterm elections are over.\n\n\"Yeah, I'd be lying otherwise,\" Newsom replied. \"I'd just be lying. And I'm not -- I can't do that.\"\n\nNewsom, whose term ends in January 2027 and is prevented from running again due to term limits, cautioned that any decision is years away.\n\n\"Fate will determine that,\" he said, when asked about whether he is moving closer to working out a reason for a national candidacy.\n\nNewsom, 58, has made trips to key battleground states, including a visit this past July to South Carolina, which as of now is slated to host the first Democratic primary in the 2028 presidential election, although that could change.\n\nDuring that trip, which featured multiple stops and was covered by \"CBS News Sunday Morning,\" Newsom met with state Democratic leaders and stopped by a coffee shop to rally activists and help employees serve espresso drinks.\n\n\"I happen to, and thank God, I'm in the right business,\" Newsom said in the interview, when asked about his evident enjoyment in meeting Democrats in South Carolina. \"I love people. I actually love people.\"\n\nNewsom said talk of him possibly running for president, after facing challenges throughout his life, including dyslexia, is a reminder to him that lives can go in surprising directions.\n\n\"I have no idea,\" Newsom said of whether he will decide to run. \"The idea that a guy who got 960 on his SAT, that still struggles to read scripts, that was always in the back of the classroom, the idea that you would even throw that out is, in and of itself, extraordinary. Who the hell knows? I'm looking forward to who presents themselves in 2028 and who meets that moment. And that's the question for the American people.\"\n\nNewsom said his focus now is on passing Proposition 50, a California ballot measure he has championed that would allow state Democrats to temporarily change the boundaries of U.S. House districts and make them more favorable to the party. Newsom has cast his effort, which will be decided in a special election next week, as a response to Mr. Trump's push for Republican-controlled states, like Texas, to change their congressional maps so the GOP has a better chance at holding on to its narrow House majority next year.\n\n\"I think it's about our democracy. It's about the future of this republic. I think it's about, you know, what the Founding Fathers lived and died for, this notion of the rule of law, and not the rule of Don,\" Newsom said.\n\nTensions have run high ahead of the vote, with both parties seeing redistricting efforts as critical to achieving their goal of winning the U.S. House majority next year. Whichever party holds control of the House has subpoena and oversight powers over the Executive Branch.\n\n\"We've got hundreds and hundreds, ICE and Border Patrol,\" Newsom told Proposition 50 supporters on Thursday at a labor event, referring to federal agents in the state. Newsom predicted their presence might increase ahead of the Nov. 4 special election.\n\n\"Don't think for a second we're not going to be seeing more of that through Election Day,\" Newsom said. \"These guys are not screwing around.\"\n\nIn recent days, the Justice Department said it would send its own monitors to supervise the special election in California and the gubernatorial election in New Jersey. Newsom has denounced the move, calling it a Trump administration move to intimidate Democrats. The goal, according to the Justice Department, is \"to ensure transparency, ballot security, and compliance with federal law.\"\n\nWhile Newsom has long been a fixture in California, his foray into presidential politics generated intense interest last year when he was a fierce defender of President Joe Biden, especially in the wake of Biden's debate performance against Mr. Trump, which prompted many Democrats to call for Biden to exit the 2024 race.\n\nNewsom, however, never wavered on Biden's candidacy. In the days before Biden dropped out of the race, Newsom stumped for him nationwide, including in New Hampshire.\n\nSpeaking with \"CBS News Sunday Morning\" there in July 2024, about a week before Biden left the race, Newsom said he was \"all in\" on Biden.\n\n\"No daylight,\" Newsom said of his alliance with Biden at the time.\n\nAccording to sources close to both Newsom and Biden, the two men are close and have stayed in touch since Biden left the White House. Newsom is also friendly with former President Barack Obama, who has offered support for Proposition 50 and joined Newsom and volunteers on a video call last week.", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/newsom-says-he-will-consider-white-house-run-after-2026-elections/"}

(Ted Soqui/Sipa USA/AP)\n\nWhen California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) launched a podcast seven months ago, he was tapping into a broader trend. Politicians, who once saw podcasts as fringe or risky, now see them as an opportunity to connect with voters in a more casual setting and relish the chance to talk for hours at a time without a filter.\n\nNot all of the politician-hosted pods are must-listens -- unless you love awkward dad jokes, groveling interviews with donors and fellow elected officials, and a heavy dose of self-promotion. Many don't last long. Former presidential candidates Pete Buttigieg, Nikki Haley, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Vivek Ramaswamy are among those who abandoned their podcasts, as are countless members of Congress.\n\nIs anyone listening? It depends. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) draws the largest audience, with an average 1.8 million downloads and views per month. Others have far fewer listeners: A podcast co-hosted by Rep. Gil Cisneros (D-California) averages only 23, according to totals pulled by the podcast analytics firm Podscribe as of earlier this month.\n\nThat hasn't stopped people from trying. No fewer than six potential presidential candidates now host their own shows, with the majority launching just this year.\n\nAndy Beshear: The supportive dad with business guy friends\n\nKentucky Gov. Andy Beshear (D) frames his feel-good podcast -- launched in April -- as a way for listeners to process the onslaught of news. The show features friendly interviews with Democratic governors, members of Congress, influencers, celebrities, athletes and musicians, and one big donor -- often ending with rapid-fire softball questions like guests' favorite sports, foods, teams, playlist picks, fashion mistakes or secret super powers.\n\nThe SiriusXM podcast has a focus on listener self-care and comes with a list of rules -- to be authentic (\"You be you, boo\"), talk like a real human being, no debating reality, tell your why and have fun. For Beshear and his fellow middle-aged friends, that equates to a recurring segment where they learn such Gen Z slang as \"skibidi\" or \"clock it\" from Beshear's children or the show's intern. The results are as corny as you'd imagine.\n\n* Key quote: \"Make sure if you're overwhelmed you take a minute to breathe, reach out to your friends, process with them just like you do on this podcast. You're important, we care about you.\"\n\n* The Jo(h)ns: Beshear's first guest on the show was Democratic megadonor John Morgan, the billionaire founder of Morgan & Morgan, who announced this year that he is starting a new political party. He's not the only Morgan & Morgan affiliate to make an appearance: The podcast includes a regular segment where Beshear and two friends -- Morgan & Morgan attorney Jon Rabinowitz and insurance company owner John McConnell -- discuss the news of day.\n\n* The sponsors: Ads on the podcast include those for a website that shares information on ingredients in drinks, Andy Cohen's podcast, JPMorgan Chase, the Marines and Comcast.\n\nTed Cruz: The traditional conservative talk show\n\n\"Verdict with Ted Cruz\" launched during President Donald Trump's first impeachment trial in 2020, and the show -- co-hosted by Ben Ferguson -- has become the most downloaded and viewed of those hosted by potential 2028 candidates. The iHeartRadio podcast expanded this spring with a new weekend radio show, making Cruz the only sitting senator with a talk radio show and a mainstay in the GOP podcast space.\n\nThe podcast is unapologetically partisan, offering insight into conservative thinking about the latest news out of Washington and sharp criticism and mocking of Democratic elected officials. Cruz also offers a behind-the-scenes look at the daily work of a senator, recapping trips to El Salvador and his latest back-and-forth with reporters in the halls of the Capitol in between the typical news of the day breakdown.\n\n* The sponsors: Ads include those for gold and silver dealers, \"less lethal\" defense pistols, dog supplements and Patriot Mobile.\n\n* Newsmaker: Cruz sometimes makes news on the show, like he did when he said Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr's threat to revoke ABC's license over a monologue by late-night host Jimmy Kimmel was \"dangerous as hell.\"\n\n* Most viewed: The most viewed YouTube versions of the vlogcast is a two-part interview with Elon Musk taped at the White House, where they discussed life on Mars and killer robots. (Cruz: \"How real is the prospect of killer robots annihilating humanity?\" Musk: \"Twenty percent likely, maybe 10 percent.\")\n\nRon DeSantis: The Florida man\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R), whose presidential ambitions were complicated in part by his awkwardness, is the latest GOP podcaster to hit the scene. Like in his campaign and governorship, DeSantis is wonkish and cerebral in the show hosted on his official gubernatorial YouTube page, discussing issues like \"Bidenflation\" and property taxes.\n\nThe show is like a pro-Florida news conference, featuring friendly interviews with political allies about the policies that have defined DeSantis's political brand. At times the show feels like a throwback to the early days of his presidential campaign: His first episode, released in May, is a conversation with Florida Surgeon General Joseph A. Ladapo, with the governor immediately mentioning Anthony S. Fauci, vaccine passports, covid jabs and mask hysteria.\n\n* Guest list: Florida, Florida, Florida -- state chief financial officer Blaise Ingoglia, Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd and the new lieutenant governor, Jay Collins.\n\n* Sports zone: DeSantis (a former college baseball player) likes to talk Marlins, Gators, Seminoles and Hurricanes, and he has hosted retired pitcher Tom Glavine.\n\n* Cold open: \"Hello. Do you ever really own your own home? In America, local jurisdictions impose property taxes on individuals land and private residences, which raises the question, if you buy a house and you live on it, you consider that your own private property. And yet you have to continue writing a check to the government every year just for the privilege of being able to use property that you supposedly already own. And that's different than how we normally do things in America.\"\n\nGavin Newsom: The people pleaser\n\n\"This Is Gavin Newsom\" is the most listened to and downloaded podcast by a Democratic elected official, by far. The podcast is centered on \"debating without demeaning\" and has proved controversial since its launch on iHeartRadio in March, with some Democrats upset that Newsom has held friendly chats with MAGA Republicans like Charlie Kirk, Stephen K. Bannon, Sean Spicer and Newt Gingrich.\n\nMost episodes focus on biographical interviews featuring politicians, influencers and Hollywood celebrities like writer and director Ryan Murphy. Newsom frequently asks guests about how Democrats lost, and he is particularly interested in why young men left the party. He has devoted multiple episodes to conversations with gender scholars and researchers who study men.\n\n* 2028 watch: Newsom and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz (D) debated Newsom's decision to have conversations on the podcast with the Republican personalities whom Walz called \"bad guys.\" Newsom argued that it's foolhardy to \"deny they exist\" and that \"we have to first understand what their motivations are.\" Walz joked about putting them \"back under a rock\" and questioned what their motivations are beyond racism and misogyny.\n\n* The sponsors: Ads include Toyota, Simply Safe, Saks Off Fifth and podcasts like \"On Purpose\" with Jay Shetty.\n\n* Not his first rodeo: Before launching the show, Newsom co-hosted an iHeart podcast earlier this year called \"Politickin'\" with football player Marshawn Lynch and agent Doug Hendrickson.\n\nStephen A. Smith: The confrontational centrist\n\nLongtime sports commentator Stephen A. Smith, who has spurred presidential buzz, launched his political show \"Straight Shooter with Stephen A.\" in September on SiriusXM's POTUS channel. Despite downplaying his political ambitions, he fielded questions in his first episode about what he would do first as president and framed hosting a politics show as his \"destiny.\"\n\nSmith opened with a lengthy explanation of his personal politics, positioning himself as an independent voice and promising: \"I hit everyone. I don't pull punches for liberals or conservatives.\" If Smith chooses to launch a celebrity bid for the White House -- particularly if he runs as a Democrat -- his show provides plenty of fodder for future opponents. He delivers frustrated rants against party leaders and praise for Republicans. He is critical of Trump, but at his most passionate when expressing his exasperation at Democrats -- sparing his two favorites for 2028, Govs. Josh Shapiro (D-Pennsylvania) and Wes Moore (D-Maryland).\n\n* The goal: \"I'm trying to help. That's all I'm trying to do. I'm trying to prevent the Democratic Party from drifting into oblivion, never to return.\"\n\n* Guest list: The first episode featured Shapiro, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina) and Utah Gov. Spencer Cox (R), with friendly surprise calls from pals Sean Hannity and Chris Cuomo.\n\n* Ears are burning: Smith has said House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries needs to do a better job at resonating with the American people, questioned the tactics of Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-New York) and Jasmine Crockett's (D-Texas) name calling, expressed skepticism about Newsom's presidential prospects, and predicted the end of Vice President Kamala Harris's political career.\n\nDonald Trump Jr.: The MAGA warrior\n\nOn Donald Trump Jr.'s \"Triggered with Don Jr.\" -- launched in 2023 -- the president's son directly takes the MAGA message to the base with his typical combative but conversational approach. The guest list regularly features the biggest Trumpworld celebrities of the moment, including members of Congress, Cabinet members, foreign leaders and GOP influencers. The hyper-partisan show focuses on culture war issues and is framed as a direct communication method that can bypass the mainstream media. It frequently revisits major Trump moments like the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol and the Russia investigation.\n\nTrump uses the show to defend his father's agenda and sometimes offers behind-the-scenes stories about being a member of the first family, as he did when he recalled a recent trip to Scotland where he and his children watched Trump negotiate a trade deal and open a golf course, which he deemed \"epic.\" Some episodes sound more like infomercials than a typical podcast, like a recent one featuring Eric Trump promoting American Bitcoin, a cryptocurrency company partially owned by the two brothers.\n\n* The sponsors: A nonlethal self-defense weapon company, gold, an automated ammunition stockpiling service, a Rumble-affiliated coffee company branded as \"fuel for the Anti-Woke Folk.\"\n\n* Key quote: \"We are the last line of defense against a completely destructive leftist agenda at home and abroad.\"", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/10/26/cringy-dad-jokes-donor-interviews-your-guide-2028-political-podcasts/"}

She then mused on her political future, saying she still sees herself having one.\n\n\"I am not done,\" Harris said. \"I have lived my entire career as a life of service and it's in my bones.\"\n\nWhen asked whether she would consider another presidential run, Harris didn't commit, but didn't rule it out, saying \"possibly,\" and adding, \"I'm not focusing on that right now.\"\n\nHowever, when CBS News polled residents in her home state of California this week on whether Harris or Gov.

Harris said in an interview that she \"possibly\" will run for president, adding an early twist to what is already likely to be a hard-fought and complicated race for the 2028 Democratic presidential nomination.\n\nSpeaking to the BBC for a segment that will air Sunday, Harris said she has not yet decided whether to seek the White House for a third time.\n\nBut when she was asked if her nieces would see a woman president, Harris said, \"In their lifetime, for sure,\" and then asked if it might be her, she added, \"Possibly.\"\n\n\"I am not done,\" Harris said in the interview, part of a tour she is conducting in conjunction with the publication of her book, \"107 Days,\" about her lightning-fast campaign for the presidency last year after President Joe Biden ended his reelection campaign.\n\n\"I have lived my entire career a life of service, and it's in my bones ... There are many ways to serve. I have not decided yet what I will do in the future beyond what I am doing right now.\"\n\nHarris appeared to bristle when the interviewer, BBC's Laura Kuenssberg, suggested that Harris has not performed well in early polls for the 2028 Democratic primary race.\n\n\"I think there are all kinds of polls that will tell you a variety of things,\" the former vice president said. \"I never listen to polls. If I had listened to polls, I never would have run for my first office or my second office, and I certainly wouldn't be sitting here in this interview.\"\n\nWhile many Democrats insist they will not focus on the 2028 race until after next year's congressional elections, party leaders are privately engaged in intense conversations over what kind of image and message they should present to voters after last year's devastating second loss to President Donald Trump.\n\nAmong those considered potential candidates are several prominent governors, including California's Gavin Newsom, Illinois' JB Pritzker, Pennsylvania's Josh Shapiro, Maryland's Wes Moore and former Kentucky governor Steve Beshear. Other figures -- including former Chicago mayor Rahm Emanuel, former Transportation secretary Pete Buttigieg, Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Rep. Ro Khanna of California -- are also said to be considering running.\n\nThe race promises to be a fight between a variety of figures with vastly different ideas on how the Democratic Party can recover from the Trump era. It will feature an unusually blunt debate over what the party should be in the years to come, given the broad rejection of the Democrats by large majorities of rural voters and those without college degrees. In the meantime, the party has been slow to complete a thorough autopsy of what went wrong in 2024.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, Harris presents a complex figure for Democrats. She is appreciated by many in the party as the first woman to serve as either president or vice president, and the first Black and Asian American person to fill that role.\n\nWhen Biden abruptly ended his reelection effort in July of last year, Harris picked up the mantle and ran what many Democrats believe was an impressive campaign under very difficult circumstances.\n\nMany in the party are eager to look forward and shed any ties with the Biden era, and Harris is a reminder of a presidency that ended with voters deeply concerned about Biden's age and abilities. Harris's book is in part an effort to deal with that reality.\n\nThe former vice president wrote that it was \"recklessness\" to leave Biden to decide, along with first lady Jill Biden, whether he should have sought reelection at age 80.\n\nShe acknowledged that she \"perhaps\" should have weighed in, but she said she worried it would have looked \"incredibly self-serving\" and disloyal for her to do.\n\n\"The stakes were simply too high,\" Harris wrote in her book. \"This wasn't a choice that should have been left to an individual's ego, an individual's ambition. It should have been more than a personal decision.\"\n\nHarris's 2020 campaign for president was a notable failure, as she was forced to withdraw early in the primary season, only to be chosen as Biden's running mate once he won the nomination.\n\nHer loss last year was traumatic for many Democrats, who viewed Trump as an existential threat to American democracy. The Democratic National Committee this year has been paying down millions in debt that the Harris campaign amassed during her run.\n\nAlthough Harris says she has yet to make a decision about a 2028 run, she has taken steps that make such a candidacy possible.\n\nIn July, she said that she would not run for governor of California, passing up a race where she would have had a strong chance of victory and pointedly leaving open the door for a White House run.\n\n\"I look forward to getting back out and listening to the American people, helping elect Democrats across the nation who will fight fearlessly, and sharing more details in the months ahead about my own plans,\" she said at the time.\n\nHarris's book has given her the opportunity to not only to clarify her role in Biden's initial decision to seek reelection, but also to take shots at potential 2028 rivals, including Shapiro and Buttigieg, both of whom she considered as potential running mates last year before settling on Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/10/25/kamala-harris-2028-election/"}

Pricey Harrison (D) holds an alternative map on Wednesday in Raleigh as a redistricting bill is debated. (Chris Seward/AP)\n\nThe fight for House control in next year's midterm elections has shifted into unfamiliar terrain: state capitals and courthouses.\n\nRather than recruiting candidates and conducting early fundraising, political operatives on both sides are focused on drawing new, mid-decade congressional maps. Instead of happening every 10 years after new census figures come out, both parties are engaged in an arms race in up to a dozen state legislatures.\n\nAnd depending on the partisan leanings of the emerging proposals, lawsuits from Democrats or Republicans have already started and more are likely to come.\n\nRepublicans have been more aggressive so far, but Democrats are trying to play political catch-up in states where they dominate the legislature and typically have their party's governor in place.\n\nEach day seems to bring a new development. Virginia Democrats have just begun a bank-shot effort to boost their party in a couple of districts, while Indiana Republicans continue to be divided over pushing ahead with such a move.\n\nWhen House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-New York) held a news conference on Thursday on Capitol Hill premised on the government shutdown, almost half of the 10 questions he took concerned these redistricting efforts.\n\nHe accused Republicans of trying to \"rig the midterm elections,\" boasting that under the maps in place for this 119th Congress, Democrats would do far better than picking up just the three seats needed to win the majority next fall.\n\n\"Republicans know that if the election were held today, they would lose and lose decisively,\" Jeffries contended.\n\nMeanwhile, House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-Louisiana) said in a CBS interview in late July that Republicans had the \"most favorable\" map any majority has had to defend in many years, adding that before the latest wave of redistricting had started, there were 13 Democrats who held seats in which President Donald Trump won last year.\n\n\"I'm absolutely convinced we are going to grow the House majority,\" Johnson said. He also said he expected the newly gerrymandered maps in Texas would help Republicans. \"I think the outcome probably inures to our benefit,\" Johnson said.\n\nDespite so much talk, there's a distinct chance that once all the dust settles next year, the new maps will only add up to a handful of additional seats for Republicans. In addition to a redistricting referendum driven by California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) that could help Democrats gain up to five seats, Democratic-dominated legislatures in Illinois and Maryland are considering drawing up lines to help their party.\n\nIf all the back-and-forth math is confusing, the Cook Political Report With Amy Walter is frequently updating a \"redistricting tracker\" for the latest developments and analysis, with a simple estimate at the top. It's behind a paywall but Erin Covey, the top analyst on House races, wrote that the \"likeliest scenario\" would give Republicans an additional six to nine seats to add to their very slim majority of three seats.\n\nInside Elections with Nathan Gonzales estimates a similar range.\n\n\"The best case redistricting scenarios for each party look like Republicans gaining a significant advantage in 14 seats they don't currently hold, and Democrats gaining a significant advantage in seven seats they don't currently hold,\" Jacob Rubashkin, deputy editor for Inside Elections, wrote in September.\n\nThese analyses do not account for a perhaps bigger long-term loss for Democrats, as a conservative Supreme Court majority increases the likelihood that the Voting Rights Act could be tossed aside. The current law has led to many majority-Black districts in the South, and its gutting could cost Democrats a dozen or so seats, with most of those coming in the 2028 elections.\n\nThe question for next November is: Will the midterms be fought in a small number of battlegrounds, giving Republicans a chance of holding or potentially narrowly growing their majority? Or will the election gravitate toward the traditional shellacking of the president's party?\n\nAfter three vacancies are filled, likely by year's end, the House will be back to full strength with 220 Republicans and 215 Democrats.\n\nThe optimistic case for Republicans is recent history.\n\nThe past three elections -- 2020, 2022 and 2024 -- have offered 1,305 opportunities to choose a representative (435 every two years), and the split has been almost dead even: Republicans won 655 times, Democrats 650.\n\nIt's the first time since the 1790s that the House majority stayed in the single digits after three straight elections, according to Bruce Mehlman, a former Republican analyst. And for two of those elections back then, the House had fewer than 70 total seats.\n\nIf this is the new normal, in which congressional politics is a recurring fight over a small amount of turf, Republicans could retain their majority just by padding their margin with an extra seven or eight seats through redistricting.\n\nIn this scenario, Democrats would need to pick up 10 or 12 seats to win the majority. That can seem like a tall order considering that Republicans won just nine seats in 2022, barely claiming the majority in that midterm, and Democrats gained just two last year.\n\nThe problem for Republicans is if next year's election turns into a more traditional midterm.\n\nDuring the 23 midterm elections that began in 1934 during Franklin D. Roosevelt's first term, the president's party gained seats just three times, according to the American Presidency Project.\n\nEach of those years netted just single-digit gains and came under extraordinary circumstances. In 1934, Roosevelt was trying to pull the nation out of the Great Depression. In 1998, President Bill Clinton was historically popular even as he faced an unpopular impeachment. And President George W. Bush was riding wartime popularity in 2002 after the terrorist attacks the prior year.\n\nOf the other 20 midterm elections, 16 delivered losses of at least 10 seats to the president's party. In 10 of those years, the other party gained anywhere from 30 to 81 seats.\n\nThat's what occurred in 2018 during Trump's first midterm, when his deep unpopularity led to a 40-seat loss for the GOP and handed the majority to Democrats.\n\nWhile many analysts have noted that Trump is more popular now than at this stage of his first term, that overlooks how historically disliked he is in this term.\n\nGallup's monthly poll found 37 percent of Americans approving of his job performance in late October 2017, and now Gallup has Trump's approval at 41 percent. That's on par with where Joe Biden was at this stage of his presidency (42 percent approval), but well behind every other first-year president since Dwight D. Eisenhower.\n\nRubashkin and Gonzales of Inside Elections said in September that Trump's aggressive actions so far suggest he believes the last election gave him a political mandate.\n\n\"But his overall job rating doesn't reflect that voter support. His disapproval rating is higher than his approval rating by a dozen points and upside down on key issues. That's an important data point in an election when Republicans need voters to be confident in the direction of the country,\" they wrote.\n\nRepublicans should not expect Trump, who has never hit 50 percent approval in Gallup's presidential ratings, to turn himself into Clinton (who had a 65 percent approval rating in October 1998). And maybe that's why senior Trump advisers, including Vice President JD Vance, have aggressively pushed GOP-led states to draw new gerrymandered maps.\n\nIn the 2022 midterms, Democrats outperformed expectations because of the extreme policies of many GOP nominees. They actually gained one seat in the Senate but narrowly lost the House majority.\n\nDemocrats need to set their expectations lower than the 63 seats Republicans gained in 2010 during President Barack Obama's first midterm election. They should not expect the 30-seat pickup that came in 2006 during what was called Bush's \"six-year-itch\" midterm.\n\nTheir own historically poor popularity in opinion polls has left Democratic voters miserable, longing for new leadership, but the 2006 and 2010 elections demonstrated something.\n\n\"A divided party can still win elections, as long as the party in power is unpopular,\" Rubashkin and Gonzales wrote.", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/10/25/redistricting-house-trump-popularity/"}

Dhillon, who leads the Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department.\n\nHaving federal observers monitor elections is not unusual. The Justice Department posted observers throughout the country under Presidents Joe Biden, Barack Obama and George W. Bush. The 1965 Voting Rights Act allows federal examiners to ensure that voters who want to register and cast their ballots can do so.\n\nBut the DOJ announcement follows requests from the Republican state committees in the two Democratic-led states asking the Justice Department to intervene, and expressing concern about transparency in those counties.\n\nIn a letter on Monday, the New Jersey Republican State Committee asked the Justice Department to send federal observers to ensure an accurate vote count in Passaic, expressing concern about mail-in ballots -- a point of obsession for Trump despite evidence that there is negligible fraud committed through mailed ballots. The California Republican State Committee made a request the same day asking the Justice Department to intervene, according to the Associated Press.\n\nThe Justice Department's announcement also comes the day before centers open in California for early voting on Proposition 50 -- a proposal backed by Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) to redraw the state's congressional districts in favor of Democrats after Texas redrew its districts this year to favor Republicans. It also comes amid a close gubernatorial race in New Jersey.\n\nDemocratic leaders in the two states have questioned the department's motives, saying they appear designed to suppress the vote or disrupt voting at the polling stations.\n\n\"Trump is sending the DOJ to California to 'monitor' the election,\" Newsom said on social media. \"His intentions are clear -- he wants to suppress the vote. And when we win, he will falsely lay claim to fraud. We will not be intimidated. California will defend free and fair elections.\"\n\nIn an emailed statement, New Jersey Attorney General Matthew J. Platkin (D) said the Justice Department decision was \"highly inappropriate,\" and that the Constitution gives \"states, not the federal government, the primary responsibility for running elections.\"\n\n\"We are committed to ensuring that every eligible voter is able to cast their ballot and make their voices heard, and we are considering all of our options to prevent any effort to intimidate voters or interfere with our elections,\" he said.\n\nTrump has sought to create a political landscape that favors Republicans ahead of next year's midterms. He has encouraged attempts to create new red seats in Missouri, Indiana and Ohio, and to carve out as many as five in Trump's home state of Florida.\n\nTrump has also pledged to end mail-in voting, which he has tended to view as favoring Democrats, despite polls showing that a majority of Republican voters are now confident in the integrity of that form of voting. More than 70 percent of Republicans expressed confidence in mail-in ballots in the 2024 election, compared with 19 percent in 2020, according to a Pew Research Center report released in December 2024.\n\nCalifornia's Proposition 50 has gained support from Democrats, who see the proposal as a legitimate way to impede Trump's efforts. But it has also garnered opposition from moderate Republicans despite their opposition to Trump's maneuvers.\n\n\"Two wrong behaviors don't make a right behavior,\" former California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger (R) said in September.", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/10/25/doj-trump-prop-50-gavin-newsom/"}

President Trump has pushed the Justice Department to pursue parts of his agenda, including going after his political enemies, which has eroded its traditional independence. Mr. Trump also blamed his 2020 election loss on rigged voting, although there was no evidence of widespread voter fraud.\n\nVoter fraud is exceedingly rare, but Mr. Trump and other Republicans have since claimed it is rampant, particularly voting by mail, which is how most Californians vote. Democrats have called the argument a ruse for voter suppression.\n\n\"This administration has made no secret of its goal to undermine free and fair elections,\" Brandon Richards, a spokesman for Gov. Gavin Newsom of California, said in a statement. \"Deploying these federal forces appears to be an intimidation tactic meant for one thing: suppress the vote.\"\n\nBoth California and New Jersey are led by Democrats and have key races or issues on the ballot that could affect the balance of power between the parties.\n\nIn New Jersey, Representative Mikie Sherrill, a Democrat, and Jack Ciattarelli, a Republican, are running in a close race to succeed Gov. Phil Murphy.\n\nIn California, Democrats are looking to a ballot measure, Proposition 50, to improve their chances of regaining control of the House in next year's midterm elections. The measure asks voters to revise California's congressional districts to favor Democrats in response to recent redistricting measures by Republican-led states such as Texas to favor their party.\n\nThe Justice Department's announcement followed complaints last weekend by the New Jersey Republican Party that Democratic members of the Board of Elections in Passaic County had blocked the use of security cameras in ballot storage areas and refused to require a sign-in log for workers with access to mail-in ballots.\n\nThen on Monday, the chairwoman of the California Republican Party, Corrin Rankin, wrote to the Justice Department, complaining that the party had received \"reports of irregularities\" in some counties that they feared \"will undermine either the willingness of voters to participate in the election or their confidence in the announced results of the election.\"\n\nThe letter asked for monitors to be sent to five counties where, the party asserted, some voters had received incorrect ballots in past elections and where Republicans had raised concerns about the maintenance and accuracy of voter lists.\n\nThe Justice Department said in a news release that personnel from the agency's Civil Rights Division would be stationed at polling places and offices of registrars of voters \"to ensure transparency, ballot security, and compliance with federal law.\"\n\nThe department said those workers would coordinate with the local U.S. attorney's offices, but it did not specify how many observers would be deployed or the types of irregularities they would seek.\n\n\"This Department of Justice is committed to upholding the highest standards of election integrity,\" Attorney General Pamela Bondi said in a statement. \"We will commit the resources necessary to ensure the American people get the fair, free, and transparent elections they deserve.\"\n\nCalifornia mails ballots to all registered voters, and most votes are cast by mail, with polling locations where voters can drop their ballots off in person if they prefer not to send them. In last November's election, 81 percent of voters in California voted by mail, according to the Secretary of State's office.\n\nDemocrats greeted the announcement with skepticism, saying the move was a politically motivated effort to disrupt consequential votes in November.\n\nShirley Weber, California's secretary of state, said that the Justice Department provided no justification for deploying monitors \"in what is a nonfederal special election.\"\n\n\"We will not permit tactics masquerading as oversight to erode voter confidence or intimidate Californians,\" she said. \"Our voters have earned the right to cast their ballots free from surveillance or interference -- from anyone.\"\n\nThe Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department enforces a range of statutes that protect the right to vote, and election officials say such monitoring has been conducted in the past under both Republican and Democratic administrations.\n\nIn 2022, under the Biden administration, the department monitored compliance with federal voting rights laws in 64 jurisdictions in 24 states for that year's general election. In 2024, it sent monitors to elections in 86 jurisdictions, including all of the major swing states.\n\nSince 2020, when President Trump falsely claimed that he had lost because Democrats had stolen the election, MAGA Republicans have maintained a relentless focus on voter fraud and have trained election observers to aggressively search for possible irregularities at polling places.\n\nScores of recounts, audits and studies, some conducted by Republicans, in the wake of Mr. Trump's loss in 2020 turned up no evidence of widespread problems with the vote, nor has any evidence materialized in more recent elections.\n\nNonetheless, in recent months, the Justice Department has sued at least a half-dozen states, including California, demanding detailed voter data, ostensibly to ensure that ineligible voters were being removed from official rosters.\n\nIn California, federal officials said monitors would be stationed in Los Angeles, Orange and Riverside Counties -- three of the most heavily populated areas of Southern California -- and across Fresno and Kern counties in the Central Valley. The targeted counties represent a population of some 17 million people and include some of the most heavily Latino areas of the state.\n\nDean Logan, the registrar-recorder for Los Angeles County, said in a statement that federal monitors, \"like all election observers,\" were welcome to observe election activities at designated locations. He added that \"the presence of election observers is not unusual and is a standard practice across the country.\"\n\nIn New Jersey, Justice Department officials said they would monitor polling in populous and immigrant-heavy Passaic County.\n\n\"If there's nothing to hide or wrong, why the concern in having the DOJ observe the elections departments?\" the California Republican Party asked in a social media post on Friday that tagged Mr. Newsom's office. \"Isn't transparency a good thing that only strengthens trust in our process, system, and government?\"", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/24/us/politics/doj-election-monitors-california-new-jersey.html"}

The department has not said why it wants the data.\n\nBrandon Richards, a spokesman for Gov. Gavin Newsom, said the DOJ has no standing to \"interfere\" with California's election because the ballot contains only a state-specific initiative and has no federal races.\n\n\"Deploying these federal forces appears to be an intimidation tactic meant for one thing: suppress the vote,\" he said in an email.\n\nBut Orange County Registrar of Voters Bob Page said it's common to have local, state, federal and even international observers and welcomes anyone who wants to watch the county's operations.\n\nLos Angeles County Clerk Dean Logan said election observers are standard practice across the country and that the county, with 5.8 million registered voters, is continuously updating and verifying its voter records.\n\n\"Voters can have confidence their ballot is handled securely and counted accurately,\" he said.\n\nMost Californians vote using mail ballots returned through the postal service, drop boxes or at local voting centers. But in pursuit of accuracy and counting every vote, the nation's most populous state has gained a reputation for tallies that can drag on for weeks - and sometimes longer.\n\nIn 2024, it took until early December to declare Democrat Adam Gray the winner in his Central Valley district, the final congressional race to be decided in the nation last year.\n\nCalifornia's request echoed a similar letter sent by New Jersey Republicans asking the DOJ to dispatch election monitors to \"oversee the receipt and processing of vote-by-mail ballots\" and \"monitor access to the Board of Elections around the clock\" in suburban Passaic County ahead of the state's governor's race.\n\nThe New Jersey Republican State Committee told Dhillon that federal intervention was necessary to ensure an accurate vote count in the heavily Latino county that was once a Democratic stronghold, but shifted to President Donald Trump's column in last year's presidential race.\n\nThe county could be critical to GOP gubernatorial nominee Jack Ciattarelli's hopes against Democrat Mikie Sherrill.\n\nThe letter, which cited previous voter fraud cases in the county and alleged a \"long and sordid history\" of vote-by-mail shenanigans, came after Republicans said Democratic members of the Passaic County Board of Elections voted against implementing additional security measures, including using cameras in ballot storage areas.\n\nIn 2020, a judge ordered a new election for a city council seat in Paterson - the largest city in Passaic County - after the apparent winner and others were charged with voter fraud.\n\n\"The reason that we have concerns about this is because there's been a significant history of fraud,\" said Kate Gibbs, executive director of the NJGOP, which is also weighing whether to request additional DOJ monitoring in a number of other counties.\n\nPlatkin said the state is committed to ensuring its elections are fair and secure. With the DOJ's announcement, he said the attorney general's office is \"considering all of our options to prevent any effort to intimidate voters or interfere with our elections.\"\n\nLocal election offices and polling places around the country already have observers from both political parties to ensure rules are followed. The DOJ also has a long history of sending observers to jurisdictions that have histories of voting rights violations to ensure compliance with federal civil rights laws.\n\nTrump has for years railed against mail voting as part of his repeated false claims that former President Joe Biden's victory in 2020 was rigged. He alleges it is riddled with fraud, even though numerous studies have found no evidence of widespread fraud in U.S. elections.\n\nEarlier this year, Trump pledged to ban vote-by-mail across the country, something he has no power to do under the U.S. Constitution.\n\nThe DOJ's effort will be overseen by Dhillon's Civil Rights Division, which will deploy personnel in coordination with U.S. attorney's offices and work closely with state and local officials, the department said.\n\nThe department also is soliciting further requests for monitoring in other jurisdictions.\n\nDavid Becker, a former DOJ attorney who has served as an election monitor and trained them, said the only federal laws the department has the jurisdiction to enforce in state elections are ones that prevent discrimination against racial minorities.\n\n\"It's a very high bar to justify Washington's intervention into state-only elections,\" said Becker, executive director of the Center for Election Integrity & Research.\n\nStill, Becker said that if monitors obey rules about not interacting with voters, poll workers or ballot counting, \"I don't think this is going to make any difference for voters.\"\n\n___\n\nColvin reported from New York.

Then conversations with some of the Bay Area's most prominent tech leaders and the mayor changed his mind.\n\n\"I got a great call from some incredible people, some friends of mine, very successful people,\" Trump told reporters Thursday at the White House, specifically referencing Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia, one of the world's most valuable tech companies, and Marc Benioff, CEO of software company Salesforce.\n\nHe said they told him San Francisco was working hard to reduce crime. \"So we are holding off that surge, everybody. And we're going to let them see if they can do it,\" Trump said. He said he could change his mind if it \"doesn't work out.\"\n\nTrump said the increased federal force had been planned for Saturday. He didn't specify whether he was just referring to National Guard troops, which he had threatened to send in, or if he would also halt a potential ramp up of immigration enforcement. U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents arrived at a U.S. Coast Guard base near the city on Thursday morning, drawing protesters.\n\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement informed Alameda County Sheriff Yesenia Sanchez that the operation had been called off for the entire Bay Area, a nine-county region of about 8 million people, Sgt. Roberto Morales, a spokesman for the sheriff, said Friday.\n\nOutreach from billionaire CEOs clearly had a hand in the rare reprieve Trump handed a Democrat-led city. But Trump also credited Mayor Daniel Lurie, who has worked to avoid direct confrontation with the Republican president since both took office in January. Lurie has governed as an earnest and relentless cheerleader of San Francisco, and repeatedly refused to weigh in on national politics or to mention Trump's name.\n\nInstead, he's focused on local issues - public safety, luring back business and reversing the city's pandemic-fueled decline. When Trump said repeatedly earlier this week that he'd send the National Guard into San Francisco to quell crime, Lurie noted overall crime is down 26% compared to last year and car break-ins are at a 22-year low.\n\n\"I told the mayor, I love what you're doing, I respect it, and I respect the people that are doing it,\" Trump said, referencing a phone call the two had Wednesday.\n\nAn heir to the Levi Strauss fortune and anti-poverty philanthropist, Lurie is a centrist Democrat who had never held office until he ousted then-Mayor London Breed in last November's election. He has stated no other political aspirations than to improve the city and has said that he will work with anyone who wants to do the same.\n\n\"I told him the same thing I told our residents,\" Lurie said at a Thursday afternoon news conference to address his call with the president. \"San Francisco is on the rise. Visitors are coming back, buildings are getting leased and purchased, and workers are coming back to the office.\"\n\nLurie said he told Trump that he welcomes the city's \"continued partnership\" with the Drug Enforcement Agency and other federal authorities to get illegal narcotics off the streets and contribute to San Francisco's falling crime rates. Fentanyl has been a major scourge on the city's streets.\n\n\"But having the military and militarized immigration enforcement in our city will hinder our recovery,\" Lurie said.\n\nFormer U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a San Francisco Democrat, praised Lurie on social media, saying that he \"has demonstrated exceptional leadership.\" Steve Kerr, Golden State Warriors head coach, called him an \"absolute superstar\" responsible for the good things happening in San Francisco.\n\nThe office of California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a former San Francisco mayor, said on X that, \"Trump, has finally, for once, listened to reason.\" Newsom, for his part, has repeatedly sparred with Trump, particularly after Trump deployed the California National Guard to Los Angeles against Newsom's wishes.\n\nBut others are skeptical that Trump will keep his word. Indeed, Trump said he was giving Lurie \"a chance\" to turn things around and said the federal government could \"take criminals out\" much faster.\n\n\"We cannot trust Trump,\" said San Francisco Supervisor Connie Chan, a progressive who runs politically left of Lurie but has a good working relationship with the mayor.\n\nSan Francisco Supervisor Jackie Fielder, who is also more politically liberal than Lurie, said in a statement that she disagrees with Lurie's desire to coordinate more with federal law enforcement, saying that \"is a dangerous invitation to a fascist administration.\"\n\nTrump said he received \"four or five calls\" from business leaders urging him not to send federal force and to let city leaders continue to work on reducing crime.\n\n\"They're the biggest people in the world, a lot of the high tech,\" he said at the White House. \"They want to do it. And I said, 'I am so honored to let you do it. And if it doesn't work out, we'll do it for you very quickly.'\"\n\nBenioff of Salesforce, who also owns Time magazine, told the New York Times earlier this month that he'd welcome Guard troops to help quell crime ahead of his major annual business conference. He quickly face backlash and then apologized, saying the troops weren't needed. He confirmed to The Associated Press that he spoke to Trump but did not provide more details. Nvidia declined to comment.\n\nIn announcing his decision to back off a surge, Trump did not mention other cities in the Bay Area, including Oakland, where he has also threatened to send in federal troops.\n\nSome other Democrats who have also taken a less combative approach to Trump have avoided his focus as he deploys Guard troops around the country. He has not, for example, focused on Detroit despite criticism of the city. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has tried to engage with Trump including with White House visits.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press journalists Mike Liedtke and Olga R.

Mayor Daniel Lurie and Gov. Gavin Newsom said it was unnecessary because crime is on the decline.\n\nSeparately, U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents began arriving at the Coast Guard base in the region earlier Thursday for a possible ramp up of immigration enforcement, a move that drew several hundred protesters.\n\nTrump said he backed off after speaking to the mayor and several prominent business leaders who said they're working hard to clean up the city.\n\nThat decision was in contrast to others made by Trump to send the military into Democratic-run cities over fierce resistance from mayors and governors.\n\nThe deployment of National Guard troops on the streets of Washington faced challenges in two courts on Friday - one in the nation's capital and another in West Virginia - while across the country a judge in Portland, Oregon, was considering whether to let Trump deploy troops there. Deployment remains blocked in the Chicago area.\n\nCoast Guard Island is a 67-acre (27-hectare) human-made island formed in 1913 in the Oakland Estuary between Oakland and Alameda.

The district attorney's office said he does not yet have a lawyer.\n\nSingh, of Yuba City, California, is from India and entered the U.S. illegally in 2022 across the southern border, Homeland Security said Thursday in a post on X.\n\nThat revelation prompted Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy to restate earlier concerns about who should be able to obtain commercial driver's licenses. Duffy and President Donald Trump have been pressing the issue and criticizing California ever since a deadly Florida crash in August was caused by an immigrant truck driver the federal government says was in the country illegally.\n\nThe Transportation Department significantly restricted when noncitizens can get commercial driver's licenses last month.\n\nDuffy said this week's crash wouldn't have happened if Newsom had followed these new rules.\n\n\"These people deserve justice. There will be consequences,\" he said in a statement.\n\nNewsom's office responded that the federal government approved Singh's federal employment authorization multiple times and this allowed him to obtain a commercial driver's license in accordance with federal law.\n\nCalifornia's Highway Patrol said in a release that traffic westbound on Interstate 10, about 26 miles (42 kilometers) west of San Bernardino, had slowed about 1 p.m. Tuesday when a tractor-trailer failed to stop, struck other vehicles and caused a chain-reaction crash.\n\nDashcam video from the tractor-trailer obtained by KABC-TV shows the truck slamming into what appears to be a small, white SUV in the freeway's center lane. It continued forward, plowing into several other vehicles, including another truck. It then crossed over two lanes before crashing into an already-disabled truck on the freeway's right shoulder.\n\nFlames can be seen erupting alongside the tractor-trailer as it crosses the two right lanes.\n\nCalifornia Highway Patrol Officer Rodrigo Jimenez says the agency has seen the KABC video and believes it is dashcam video from the truck that caused the crash.\n\n\"This tragedy follows a disturbing pattern of criminal illegal aliens driving commercial vehicles on American roads, directly threatening public safety,\" Homeland Security said Thursday in its X post.\n\nIn August, a truck driver made an illegal turn on Florida's Turnpike, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) north of West Palm Beach, and was struck by a minivan. Two passengers in the minivan died at the scene, and the driver died at a hospital.\n\nHomeland Security has said that truck driver, Harjinder Singh, was in the United States illegally. Florida authorities said he entered the U.S. illegally from Mexico in 2018.\n\nHomeland Security said Harjinder Singh obtained a commercial driver's license in California, which is one of 19 states, as well as the District of Columbia, that issue licenses regardless of immigration status, according to the National Immigration Law Center.\n\nThe Trump administration has pointed to the Florida crash while sparring with California's Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom.\n\nIn April, Trump issued an executive order saying truckers who don't read and speak the English language proficiently would be considered unfit for service.\n\n\"A driver who can't understand English will not drive a commercial vehicle in this country. Period,\" Duffy said the following month.\n\nUnder the new Transportation Department rules imposed last month, only noncitizen drivers who have three specific visas are allowed to qualify for commercial licenses. And states will be required to verify their immigration status. Only drivers who hold either an H-2a, H-2B or E-2 visa will qualify. H-2B is for temporary nonagricultural workers, while H-2a is for agricultural workers. E-2 is for people who make substantial investments in a U.S. business\n\nThe licenses will only be valid for up to one year unless the applicant's visa expires sooner than that.\n\nOn Thursday, Duffy called the California crash \"outrageous\" in a social media post.\n\n\"This is exactly why I set new restrictions that prohibit ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS from operating trucks,\" he wrote on X. \"@CAgovernor must join every other state in the U.S. in enforcing these new actions to prevent any more accidents and deaths.\"\n\nBhupinder Kaur, director of operations for UNITED SIKHS, said the New York-based humanitarian relief nonprofit, is alarmed by what it sees as growing bias involving immigrant drivers.\n\nIt was not immediately clear Thursday afternoon if Jashanpreet Singh is Sikh.\n\n\"Law enforcement and hasty social media posts constantly rush to name, photograph, and expose immigration status, while similar details about non-immigrant drivers remain withheld,\" Kaur told The Associated Press in an email Thursday. \"The discretion officials cite as 'privacy' elsewhere seems to vanish when the driver is an immigrant.\"\n\nImmigrant truckers make up nearly one in five long-haul drivers, Kaur continued, adding that most are fully licensed and law-abiding.\n\n\"Yet they face unequal scrutiny and coverage,\" Kaur said. \"Selective transparency distorts public understanding and can even influence legal outcomes.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Luis Andres Henao in Princeton, New Jersey, and Audrey McAvoy in Honolulu contributed.\n\n____\n\nThis story has been corrected to say that California is one of 19 states in as well as the District of Columbia, that issue standard driver's licenses regardless of immigration status, according to the National Immigration Law Center.", "url": "https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2025/oct/24/deadly-semitrailer-crash-california-renewing-federal-criticism/"}

On Friday, the agency said Singh should have been ineligible to keep his CDL days before the deadly crash under new emergency actions targeting noncitizens, including asylum-seekers.\n\nIn September, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced stricter eligibility requirements for noncitizens seeking CDLs. The new federal actions, which went into effect on Sept. 26, prevent all asylum-seekers from obtaining non-domiciled CDLs, according to the DOT.\n\nSingh was issued a restricted, non-domiciled CDL on June 27, according to the DOT.

It's an a...", "content": "The White House Correspondents' Dinner is a Washington tradition in which the president and members of the press get together, have a few drinks and tell a few jokes at each other's expense. It's an annual event, but the 2011 dinner was especially notable.\n\nThat was the year that then-President Barack Obama got up and absolutely roasted Donald Trump -- and there's one joke from that night that has a certain resonance today. At the time, Trump was mulling a run for president. During his set, Obama said that, if elected, Trump \"certainly would bring some change to the White House.\"\n\nObama joked about an alternative universe in which Trump found his way into the White House and mused about what the real estate developer would do to the historic building, sharing a mocked-up picture showing it fitted out with golden columns and a neon sign bearing Trump's name.\n\nFast-forward 14 years, and we are, of course, now living in that alternate universe that Obama conjured up that night. By now, you have seen the images of Trump's construction crews tearing down the entire East Wing of the White House to make room for a gaudy new ballroom that the president plans to build in its place.\n\nNow, it can be frustrating, even infuriating, to watch Trump destroy a building that belongs to all of us, without approval from Congress or anyone else, just because he feels like it. But in doing so, the president is literally making himself the punch line of a 14-year-old joke -- a joke about what might happen if a narcissistic real estate developer with horrible taste became the president of the United States.\n\nTrump is proving once again that he remains a captive of the very stereotype that's made him a target of ridicule for so many years. He just can't seem to help himself. In that way, Trump himself is a joke, a walking, talking parody.\n\nThat's not to say his actions in office aren't dangerous -- they are -- but here's the thing: Authoritarian leaders can become so caught up in projecting their own power that their levels of blatant public corruption just get more laughable as they go.\n\nLet me give you an example. On Thursday, Trump pardoned Changpeng Zhao, the head of a cryptocurrency exchange, who was convicted of violating money laundering laws after he allowed criminals to use his platform to finance everything from child sex abuse to drug trafficking to terrorism. It was an outrageous move, made all the more outrageous by the fact that the company he founded has major business ties to the Trump family's own crypto venture.\n\nWhen Trump was asked about that pardon, he lashed out in his typical way. First, he said he had no idea what the reporter was talking about, even though the company Zhao founded has been campaigning for a pardon for a year. Then, Trump seemed to remember who Zhao was and told reporters that \"a lot of people say that he wasn't guilty of anything ... He served four months in jail and they say that he was not guilty of anything.\" This is equally ludicrous, because he pleaded guilty.\n\nLook, recognizing the absurdity of that doesn't minimize the danger of Trump -- it minimizes Trump himself, it exposes him for the small man he is, and it makes it easier to push back against his corruption.\n\nSo now, a number of Trump's opponents are showing that it isn't so hard to stand up to an insecure bully. Ever since he retook office, the president and his allies in Congress have been targeting special counsel Jack Smith, investigating him and trying to paint him as some kind of devious criminal.\n\nOn Thursday, Smith punched back: His attorneys sent a letter to Congress proclaiming that \"Mr. Smith respectfully requests the opportunity to testify in open hearings before the House and Senate Judiciary Committees.\"\n\nIn other words, Smith is telling Trump and his cronies that he wants to have this fight, and to have it in public. Smith is calling their bluff because he knows that what he can expose about Trump is far worse than anything they can do to him.\n\nWe're seeing that same kind of fight from Democratic elected officials who are making the bet that it pays to stand up to Trump, like California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker. Both have taken the fight directly to the president, showing very effective ways of dealing with a bully.\n\nOn Thursday, Trump backed off his threats to send National Guard troops into San Francisco after just one call with the city's Democratic mayor. And while it remains to be seen what will happen in the end, the president has already blinked, and he's shown that he will back down.\n\nDemocrats can clearly sense that, and in so many different ways, they now feel emboldened to go on offense.\n\nFor weeks, the White House has been lobbying Republican states to redraw their congressional maps and to give the president's party a big advantage in the midterms. Trump's tactics have succeeded in a few states, like Texas and North Carolina.\n\nBut Democrats in California are pushing back with Proposition 50, giving voters a chance to stand up to Trump by voting to redraw their state maps to counter what Republicans did in Texas. And after a relentless pressure campaign from Trump and Vice President JD Vance, Republicans in Indiana still don't have the votes to redraw maps there and steal more seats. Meanwhile, activists in Missouri are working to make sure voters have a chance to overrule any new maps in that state at the ballot box.\n\nOn Thursday, Democrats in Virginia announced that they are initiating a plan to redraw maps there, potentially netting Democrats three new seats in Congress. That makes the state's gubernatorial election in less than two weeks all the more important, but luckily for Democrats, Trump is hugely unpopular in that state. A new poll from Suffolk University found the president underwater by more than 12 points.\n\nSo yes, Trump is cruel and corrupt, he's knocking down the White House for a ballroom, and he's shaking down American taxpayers while pardoning a crypto CEO who has been a huge proponent of his own crypto business. That is all true. But he is also weak. He is unpopular. He's a joke.\n\nDemocrats know that -- and they know that it pays to stand up to him.", "url": "https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-self-parody-white-house-renovations-crypto-unpopular-rcna239597"}

The goal, according to the DOJ, is \"to ensure transparency, ballot security, and compliance with federal law.\"\n\n\"Transparency at the polls translates into faith in the electoral process, and this Department of Justice is committed to upholding the highest standards of election integrity,\" Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement.\n\nElection monitoring is a routine function of the Justice Department, but the focus on California and New Jersey comes as both states are set to hold closely watched elections with national consequences on Nov. 4. New Jersey has an open seat for governor that has attracted major spending by both parties and California is holding a special election aimed at redrawing the state's congressional map to counter Republican gerrymandering efforts elsewhere ahead of the 2026 midterms.\n\nThe DOJ's efforts are also the latest salvo in the GOP's preoccupation with election integrity after President Trump spent years refusing to accept the results of the 2020 election and falsely railing against mail-in voting as rife with fraud. Democrats fear the new administration will attempt to gain an upper hand in next year's midterms with similarly unfounded allegations of fraud.\n\nThe announcement comes days after the Republican parties in both states wrote letters to the Justice Department requesting their assistance. Some leading Democrats in the states blasted the decision.\n\nNew Jersey Attorney General Matt Platkin called the move \"highly inappropriate\" and said the department \"has not even attempted to identify a legitimate basis for its actions.\"\n\nRusty Hicks, chair of the California Democratic Party, said in a statement that \"No amount of election interference by the California Republican Party is going to silence the voices of California voters.\"\n\nThe letter from the California GOP, sent Monday and obtained by the Associated Press, asked Harmeet Dhillon, who leads the DOJ's Civil Rights Division, to provide monitors to observe the election in the five counties.\n\n\"In recent elections, we have received reports of irregularities in these counties that we fear will undermine either the willingness of voters to participate in the election or their confidence in the announced results of the election,\" wrote GOP Chairwoman Corrin Rankin.\n\nThe state is set to vote Nov. 4 on a redistricting proposition that would dramatically redraw California's congressional lines to add as many as five additional Democratic seats to its U.S. House delegation.\n\nEach of the counties named, they alleged, has experienced recent voting issues, such as sending incorrect or duplicate ballots to voters. They also take issue with how Los Angeles and Orange counties maintain their voter rolls.\n\nCalifornia is one of at least eight states the Justice Department has sued as part of a wide-ranging request for detailed voter roll information involving at least half the states. The department has not said why it wants the data.\n\nElection integrity efforts were a focus of Dhillon's California law practice before she joined the Justice Department. Her practice sued over the state's election laws in the past, including a 2020 lawsuit on behalf of the California Republican Party challenging ballot collection efforts amid the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nBrandon Richards, a spokesman for Gov. Gavin Newsom, said the DOJ has no standing to \"interfere\" with California's election because the ballot contains only a state-specific initiative and has no federal races.\n\n\"Deploying these federal forces appears to be an intimidation tactic meant for one thing: suppress the vote,\" he said in an email.\n\nOrange County Registrar of Voters Bob Page said he welcomes anyone who wants to watch the county's election operations and said it's common to have local, state, federal and even international observers. He described Orange County's elections as \"accessible, accurate, fair, secure, and transparent.\"\n\nLos Angeles County Clerk Dean Logan said election observers are standard practice across the country and that the county, with 5.8 million registered voters, is continuously updating and verifying its voter records.\n\n\"Voters can have confidence their ballot is handled securely and counted accurately,\" he said.\n\nMost Californians vote using mail ballots returned through the postal service, drop boxes or at local voting centers, which typically leaves polling places relatively quiet on Election Day. But in pursuit of accuracy and counting every vote, the nation's most populous state has gained a reputation for tallies that can drag on for weeks -- and sometimes longer.\n\nIn 2024, it took until early December to declare Democrat Adam Gray the winner in his Central Valley district, the final congressional race to be decided in the nation last year.\n\nCalifornia's request echoed a similar letter sent by New Jersey Republicans asking the DOJ to dispatch election monitors to \"oversee the receipt and processing of vote-by-mail ballots\" and \"monitor access to the Board of Elections around the clock\" in suburban Passaic County ahead of the state's governor's race.\n\nThe New Jersey Republican State Committee told Dhillon that federal intervention was necessary to ensure an accurate vote count in the heavily Latino county that was once a Democratic stronghold, but shifted to Mr. Trump's column in last year's presidential race.\n\nThe county could be critical to GOP gubernatorial nominee Jack Ciattarelli's hopes against Democrat Mikie Sherrill. But the letter cited previous voter fraud cases in the county and alleged a \"long and sordid history\" of vote-by-mail shenanigans.\n\nIn 2020, a judge ordered a new election for a city council seat in Paterson -- the largest city in Passaic County -- after the apparent winner and others were charged with voter fraud.\n\nPlatkin said the state is committed to ensuring its elections are fair and secure. With the DOJ's announcement, he said the attorney general's office is \"considering all of our options to prevent any effort to intimidate voters or interfere with our elections.\"\n\nLocal election offices and polling places around the country already have observers from both political parties to ensure rules are followed. The DOJ also has a long history of sending observers to jurisdictions that have histories of voting rights violations to ensure compliance with federal civil rights laws.\n\nLast year, when the Biden administration was still in power, some Republican-led states said they would not allow federal monitors to access voting locations on Election Day.\n\nMr. Trump has for years railed against mail voting as part of his repeated false claims that former President Joe Biden's victory in 2020 was rigged. He alleges it is riddled with fraud, even though numerous studies have found no evidence of widespread fraud in U.S. elections.\n\nEarlier this year, Mr. Trump pledged to ban vote-by-mail across the country, something he has no power to do under the U.S. Constitution.\n\nThe DOJ's effort will be overseen by Dhillon's Civil Rights Division, which will deploy personnel in coordination with U.S. attorney's offices and work closely with state and local officials, the department said. The department is also soliciting further requests for monitoring in other jurisdictions.\n\nDavid Becker, a CBS News election law expert and political contributor who has served as an election monitor and trained them, said the work is typically done by department lawyers who are prohibited from interfering at polling places.\n\nBut Becker, the executive director of the Center for Election Integrity & Research, said local jurisdictions normally agree to the monitors' presence.\n\nIf the administration tried to send monitors without a clear legal rationale to a place where local officials didn't want them, \"That could result in chaos,\" he said.", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/justice-department-election-monitors-california-new-jersey/"}

But Trump's Makeover Is.", "description": "Presidents have always tailored the White House to their needs, but with the demolition of the East Wing, a $300 million ballroom and other changes, President Trump isn't wasting any time making it in...", "content": "Presidents have always tailored the White House to their needs, but with the demolition of the East Wing, a $300 million ballroom and other changes, President Trump isn't wasting any time making it into his own project.\n\nPresident Trump is far from the first president to put his mark on the White House, a building that has been changing almost since the day it opened in 1800.\n\nThomas Jefferson added a wine cellar, and James Monroe and Andrew Jackson put on porticos. Theodore Roosevelt erected the West Wing; Richard Nixon added a bowling alley; and Barack Obama adapted a tennis court to create a place to play hoops. Franklin D. Roosevelt put in a pool.\n\nYet for all of that, the images this week of the East Wing's tear-down have still been jarring, as Mr. Trump began construction on a $300 million ballroom that he promised would be big, beautiful and \"privately funded by many generous Patriots.\"\n\n\"Every President has dreamt about having a Ballroom at the White House to accommodate people for grand parties, State Visits, etc.,\" the president posted on Truth Social on Monday, adding, \"This Ballroom will be happily used for Generations to come!\"\n\nMr. Trump's second-term overhaul of the White House already ranks among its most extensive, as the president has forcefully exerted his executive -- and aesthetic -- privilege on the Oval Office, the Rose Garden and other spaces.\n\nExperts place the makeover beyond anything since the Kennedys' Camelot era -- when the Rose Garden, now covered in stone slabs, was renewed -- or even further back, to Harry S. Truman's tenure, when he basically saved the White House from collapsing in on itself.\n\nBut no one has seemingly been more determined to put his stamp on \"The People's House,\" as it's known, said Kate Andersen Brower, a journalist and the author of \"The Residence: Inside the Private World of the White House.\"\n\n\"Nobody has tried to reshape the White House into their happy place like what he's doing,\" she said.\n\nThe White House has defended the changes as part of a long tradition of presidential upgrades. But the demolition work has also led to the awkward optics of the president tearing down a singular symbol of American democracy, something that has inspired a furious outcry, including from some who lived there in the past.\n\n\"It's not his house. It's your house,\" wrote Hillary Clinton on X. \"And he's destroying it.\"\n\nExperts on the White House say the president's pad has, in fact, long needed more room for large events, including James A. Abbott, an author of \"Designing Camelot: The Kennedy White House Restoration and Its Legacy,\" who said a large state dining room had been \"needed for 60 years.\"\n\n\"The White House has to evolve for the needs of the office,\" Mr. Abbott said, noting that other presidential administrations had groused that the White House's capacity for state dinners was limited by space. The Obamas, for instance, used tents for some occasions, and the Kennedys divided guests up into separate rooms.\n\nAnd while Mr. Abbott said he did not agree with the Trumps' politics, or the planned location of the new ballroom, he defended the right to build it.\n\n\"Do not blame the Trumps,\" he said. \"What they're trying to do is make sure the accommodations fulfill the need.\"\n\nMr. Trump has offered practical justifications for some other changes to the premises, saying, for instance, that one of his reasons for placing slabs over the Rose Garden was that the grass footing was difficult to navigate for women in heels.\n\nStill, reviews of the ballroom's plans, and its splashy interior, have been decidedly mixed.\n\n\"It looks like the Bellagio without the craps tables,\" said Robert Klara, the author of \"The Hidden White House: Harry Truman and the Reconstruction of America's Most Famous Residence.\"\n\nArchitectural historians have expressed \"grave concern\" about the project, while others have noted that the construction does not have the approval of the National Capital Planning Commission, which oversees government buildings in Washington. On Tuesday, the National Trust for Historic Preservation urged a pause for the \"legally required public review process.\"\n\nThe demolition also seemingly contradicts the president's own pledge that it would not \"interfere with the current building.\"\n\nAnd with the government still shut down and many people still struggling, the ballroom construction has also been sharply criticized in economic terms.\n\n\"Oh you're trying to say the cost of living is skyrocketing?\" Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, wrote on X. \"Donald Trump can't hear you over the sound of bulldozers demolishing a wing of the White House.\"\n\nNone of which seems to bother a president who continues to challenge institutional norms, a position amplified by his backers.\n\n\"Losers who are quick to criticize need to stop their pearl clutching and understand the building needs to be modernized,\" said Steven Cheung, the White House communications director, in a post on X. \"Otherwise you're just living in the past.\"\n\nMr. Trump is not the only president who has been criticized for extravagance or the cost of upgrades. According to the White House Historical Association, Mr. Jefferson -- ever the sophisticate -- took some heat for adding pricey colonnades; Andrew Jackson's addition of the North Portico, around 1829-30, was also viewed as problematic because of the economic downturn at the time. Even the East Wing -- built out during Franklin D. Roosevelt's presidency and now being gutted -- was questioned because of its construction during wartime belt-tightening.\n\nExperts in psychology and design say Mr. Trump's motivations may lie in a mix of political and personal preferences, like his obsession with gold, including branding his administration \"a new Golden age.\"\n\nGlittering surroundings imply wealth, of course, and wealth implies power, social standing and sophistication. Rebecca Zorach, an art historian and co-author of \"Gold: Nature and Culture,\" noted that rulers had long used grandiose projects like Versailles to express \"ephemeral displays\" of political, spiritual and religious power.\n\nMr. Trump's ample use of gilt might also have a strategic motive, said Sally Augustin, a psychologist who has studied the mental impact of design. \"People are meant to be hyper-stimulated in that environment, which sort of puts them on their back foot,\" she said.\n\nThe ballroom renovation has raised sinister speculation from some Democrats as well. \"Who spends $200 million on a ballroom at their home and then leaves?\" said Gov. Gavin Newsom of California, at a Politico event in late August.\n\nThe makeovers are not completely surprising considering the president's background: a real estate mogul who has always loved a big project, building golf courses, hotels and skyscrapers all affixed with his name, though he has also had a series of projects fail and flop.\n\n\"I'm going to be building,\" Mr. Trump recalled saying to an associate in \"Art of the Deal,\" his 1987 memoir, \"when everyone else has gone bust.\"\n\nEven before construction began, Mr. Trump seemed excited by his latest project, spotted on the roof surveying the site.\n\n\"Nobody previously had any knowledge or experience in doing such things,\" the president wrote in June, of building. \"But I do.\"\n\nThe White House, however, is a different type of project, already built and in no need of branding, a symbol of both government and an actual museum, as well as a residence whose tenants are -- by dint of democracy and term limits -- always just passing through.\n\nMs. Brower said Mr. Trump's efforts had far outstripped those of his predecessors, noting, for instance, that while Ronald Reagan \"had a lot of western paraphernalia -- horse saddles and things like that.\" But, \"he wasn't trying to recreate the White House into a horse ranch like his ranch in California,\" she said. \"Kennedy wasn't trying to make it like Hyannis Port or Palm Beach.\"\n\nNot so for Mr. Trump, whose embrace of the South Florida sensibility extended into using striped yellow-and-white beach umbrellas -- like those at Mar-a-Lago -- on the Rose Garden, which he is calling the Rose Garden Club.\n\nKrystine I. Batcho, a professor of psychology at Le Moyne College in Syracuse who has written about the importance of home in human psychology, said renovations often came from the same place as big political and policy decisions: the urge to leave a legacy, particularly for people whose self-esteem is \"wrapped up in their success in the world.\"\n\nShe added: \"Their need is greater to put their mark, in external ways, both in their public life and their personal lives.\"\n\nMr. Klara, a critic of the ballroom's design, said that with other presidential changes, there was not a sense that \"they wanted people to look at those additions and think of them.\"\n\nMr. Trump's changes, though, seemed different.\n\n\"There's a self-aggrandizement to the scale that, to me, seems more about the builder than the building,\" he said.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/24/style/renovations-at-the-white-house-arent-unusual-but-trumps-makeover-is.html"}

More than 60% of those enrolled are seniors and children.\n\n\"It's not only challenging, it's a bit of a crisis,\" said Caitlyn Sly, CEO of the Food Bank of Contra Costa and Solano counties.\n\nThe food bank is already feeding 65,000 households a month, which makes up nearly 3 million meals, between the two Bay Area counties.\n\nSly anticipates many neighbors will be needing the food bank's help for the first time in light of the CalFresh delays.

We also know it could be you. It could be me. It doesn't take much to need food,\" said Sly.\n\nAnother layer to this, Sly says, is the economic impact of a CalFresh disruption.\n\n\"Grocers are going to be impacted. Food vendors, food producers, the people that drive the delivery trucks. It's all part of the ecosystem. For every $1.00 of CalFresh benefits that are put on somebody's EBT card, that generates $1.54 in local economic activity.

(AP) -- A major union announced a proposal Thursday to impose a one-time 5% tax on billionaires in California to address federal funding cuts to health care for low-income people.\n\nProponents, including the Service Employees International Union, hope to place the statewide measure before voters next year. The tax would be on the net worth of California's richest residents. A small portion of the money would also help fund K-12 education since the federal government has threatened to withhold grant money from public schools.\n\nBackers of the measure sent a request to Attorney General Rob Bonta this week to get approval to start collecting signatures. The proposal would have to receive more than 870,000 signatures by next spring to qualify for the ballot in November 2026. If it qualifies, it's not guaranteed to pass. Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, for example, has opposed tax hikes in the past, including those specifically targeting the rich.\n\nProponents of the initiative said it was critical to backfill cuts to Medicaid because lives are at stake.\n\n\"If we do not do this, millions of people are going to lose health care, an untold number of people will go without treatment and there will be tragedy after tragedy,\" said Dave Regan, president of SEIU-United Healthcare Workers West.\n\nBillionaires would have to pay for tax year 2026, and the money could start being appropriated in 2027. The tax would generate $100 billion in revenue for the state, backers say. The initiative says it's \"designed to make the State tax system more equitable.\"\n\nThe big tax and spending cuts law President Donald Trump signed earlier this year will cut more than $1 trillion over a decade from Medicaid and federal food assistance.\n\nThe California Budget and Policy Center, a think tank in Sacramento, estimated the state could lose $30 billion in federal funding a year for Medicaid, which would result in up to 3.4 million people losing their coverage.\n\nNewsom said earlier this month that people enrolled in Covered California, the state's health insurance marketplace, could see their monthly health care bills nearly double next year as a result of the spending cuts law.\n\n\"California has led the nation in expanding access to affordable health care, but Donald Trump is ripping it away,\" he said.\n\nProponents of the proposed ballot initiative say billionaires have an obligation to do their part.\n\n\"We hope that some and perhaps hopefully a large number of billionaires will recognize that it's important in the state where they've grown their fortune that they have a responsibility to society to preserve the future of California,\" said Emmanuel Saez, a professor of economics at the University of California, Berkeley.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/california-union-proposes-taxing-billionaires-offset-medicaid-cuts-126815207"}

Here's what to know.\n\nLower-income families who qualify for SNAP receive debit cards loaded each month by the federal government that work only for groceries at participating stores and farmers markets.\n\nThe average monthly benefit is $187 per person. Most beneficiaries have incomes at or below the poverty level.\n\nTime is running short to keep benefits flowing in November.\n\nCongress and President Donald Trump could strike a deal to end the federal shutdown that started Oct. 1.\n\nPHOTOS: States worry about how to fill the gap in food aid ahead of a federal benefits halt\n\nIt's also possible that the Trump administration would allocate money for the program even if the shutdown continues. The liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities estimates that about $5 billion is available in a contingency fund and is calling on the administration to use that for partial benefits in November, but it's not clear if that's being seriously discussed.\n\nThe USDA has not answered questions from The Associated Press about whether those funds might be tapped.\n\nStates have also indicated that there could be a delay in benefits even if a deal is struck to fund SNAP for November.\n\nOfficials from Alaska, New Mexico and North Dakota have said that they've considered using state money to keep the food aid flowing but fear a federal government directive may make that impossible.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees SNAP, told states earlier this month not to send information to the vendors who provide the debit cards because of uncertainty about whether the program would be funded in November.\n\nOfficials in the states say that federal control of the system appears to stand in the way of their attempts to fund the program on their own.\n\n\"Without action from USDA, I think it is highly unlikely that any states would issue November SNAP benefits,\" Carolyn Vega, a policy analyst at the advocacy group Share Our Strength, said in an email. \"On top of the technical challenges, states can't shoulder that cost, especially with the risk it wouldn't be refunded.\"\n\nSylvia Serrano gets $100 every month to help buy groceries for herself and the four grandchildren she's raising in Camden, New Jersey.\n\nTwo of her grandkids have autism, and because of their aversions to certain textures they eat only certain foods that are unlikely to be available at food banks.\n\nThe act of getting food could also be harder for her without SNAP. She now does her shopping while the kids are at school, using a grocery store that's close to home due to her not-so-reliable car.\n\nShe says that with SNAP, she can mostly stay up on her other expenses. Without it? \"I would have to send less payment into a bill or something in order to cover the needs and then the bills are going to get behind,\" Serrano said.\n\nVirginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, a Republican, said he was declaring a state of emergency to provide food benefits to SNAP beneficiaries, but didn't detail how.\n\nLouisiana Gov. Jeff Landry, another Republican, said he was making it a top priority to make sure \"seniors, individuals with disabilities, and children who rely on food stamps do not go hungry in Louisiana,\" but he has also not detailed how.\n\nNew Hampshire officials announced a plan to increase access to food through food banks and mobile pantries. It would require approval of a legislative committee in the GOP-controlled state.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, said this week that he would deploy the National Guard to help food banks. \"This is serious, this is urgent - and requires immediate action,\" he said.\n\nSome states are telling SNAP recipients to be ready for the benefits to stop.\n\nArkansas is advising recipients to identify food pantries and other groups that might be able to help, and to ask friends and family for aid.\n\nIt's unclear whether any benefits left on recipients EBT cards on Nov. 1 will be available to use. Arkansas officials suggest people who have balances on their cards to use it this month on shelf-stable foods.\n\nMissouri and Pennsylvania officials, on the other hand, expect previous benefits will remain accessible and are telling beneficiaries to save for November if they can.\n\nOklahoma is encouraging people who receive benefits to visit a state website that connects people with nonprofits, faith-based groups, Native American tribes and others that may be able to help with food.\n\nSeparate federal program cuts this year have already put food banks that supply food pantries in a tough spot, said George Matysik, the executive director of Share Food Program in Philadelphia.\n\nSo dealing with an anticipated surge in demand could be tough.\n\nMatysik said it's especially acute for his organization and others in Pennsylvania, where a state government budget impasse has meant at least a pause in another funding stream. He said the group has had to cut about 20% of its budget, or $8.5 million, this year.\n\n\"Any time we have a crisis, it's always the working class that feels the pain first,\" he said.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press reporters Sophie Austin in Sacramento, California; Scott Bauer in Madison, Wisconsin; Becky Bohrer in Juneau, Alaska; Jack Brook in Baton Rouge, Louisiana; Jack Dura in Bismarck, North Dakota; Susan Haigh in Hartford, Connecticut; John Hanna in Topeka, Kansas; Marc Levy in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania; Morgan Lee in Santa Fe, New Mexico; and Sean Murphy in Oklahoma City contributed to this article.", "url": "https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2025/oct/23/ahead-federal-benefits-halt-states-worry-fill-gap-food-aid/"}

Gavin Newsom should run for president in 2028, but among California's voters overall, that view is more split.\n\n(Nationally, of course, any entrant on the Democratic side would first need to appeal to the party's rank-and-file in the primaries across many states. The perspective of home-state voters on an elected official, either in opinions or in state race results, is often taken as a view from the voters who've presumably gotten to know their work more closely over the years.)\n\nNewsom's overall approval rating as governor is positive and a little higher than the percentage who want him to run in 2028.\n\nGiven that speculation, California voters tend to think Newsom right now is paying attention to both national and state issues -- though fewer feel he is paying mind to their local issues.\n\nBy comparison, more California Democrats say Newsom should run in 2028 than say that of former Vice President Kamala Harris, who previously represented California in the Senate.\n\nFewer than a third of the state's voters -- and just under half of California Democrats -- think she should run. She won her home state when she ran in 2024.\n\nMost independents don't think Newsom or Harris should run, but by comparison, they are much more likely to think Newsom should.\n\nAs Californians are thinking about Prop 50 in national terms, we also wanted to know how they saw the state, relative to the nation on other matters, too.\n\nCalifornians think the state sets a good example for the rest of the U.S. on technology and innovation, on culture, and for a slight majority, on environmental policy.\n\nBut few think it sets a good example on housing policy (most California voters also describe the cost of living in the state more generally as unmanageable), on tax policy, on economic policy or on its politics.\n\nPerhaps related, most Californians -- including many with higher incomes -- describe the cost of living in the state as either somewhat or very unmanageable.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, California's gubernatorial race will take place next year, with the primary also still many months off to establish the top two vote getters for the November 2026 general election.\n\nAs with any contest so distant, voters can and do consider multiple candidates or potential entrants, and long before having to make a single choice. That is reflected here. For many voters, they have not heard enough about many.\n\nIn all, current Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla of California is the most considered name (though he's not a candidate, there are reports he may be considering entering the race) and particularly so among Democrats. He's also won statewide office before and by comparison is best known to voters.\n\nFormer Rep. Katie Porter remains slightly more considered than other Democrats besides Padilla, but also has a somewhat higher number saying she's not being considered.\n\nAlso as a part of the early process, there is plenty of cross-consideration. Most of the voters considering Porter are also considering Padilla, and vice versa. Democratic voters are often considering a number of the Democrats running.\n\nThe overall number who haven't heard enough, and who are cross-considering, only emphasizes the point that in the minds of voters that this next-year contest is only just beginning to take shape.\n\nIn a state where voters of one party outnumber the other by such a wide margin, one dynamic to watch is who is seen as trying to earn votes or as taking them for granted. Neither party does especially well overall, with Democrats faring a little better than Republicans on being seen as trying to earn votes, but also worse on perceptions of taking votes for granted. A lot of independents are skeptical of both parties, with only about a quarter of them feeling that California's Democrats or its Republicans try to earn their votes.", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/poll-california-newsom-harris-to-run-president/"}

(Manuel Orbegozo/Reuters)\n\nPresident Donald Trump said Thursday that he has called off plans to send a \"surge\" of federal personnel into San Francisco this weekend to target crime, an announcement that came after he had a private conversation with Mayor Daniel Lurie.\n\nTrump made his announcement on social media, saying \"friends\" who live in the city, including Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang and Salesforce chief executive Marc Benioff, asked him not to go forward with the operation. He said he agreed in a phone call with Lurie (D) late Wednesday to give the mayor more time to address crime issues.\n\nThe president's decision came as Lurie and other San Francisco leaders had denounced the pending deployment of federal personnel; protesters gathered Thursday outside Coast Guard Base Alameda, where U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers began arriving.\n\n\"I spoke to Mayor Lurie last night and he asked, very nicely, that I give him a chance to see if he can turn it around,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social. \"I told him I think he is making a mistake, because we can do it much faster, and remove the criminals that the Law does not permit him to remove ... Great people like Jensen Huang, Marc Benioff, and others have called saying that the future of San Francisco is great. They want to give it a 'shot.' Therefore, we will not surge San Francisco on Saturday. Stay tuned!\"\n\nSkip to end of carousel\n\nICE increasingly targets undocumented migrants with no criminal record\n\nThe Trump administration is increasingly targeting unauthorized immigrants with no criminal record as it ramps up arrests, a Washington Post analysis of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement data shows.\n\nEnd of carousel\n\nIn a post on X, Lurie said he received assurances from Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi L. Noem that the president was \"calling off\" enhanced federal operations.\n\nIn their call, the mayor said, \"I told him the same thing I told our residents: San Francisco is on the rise. Visitors are coming back, buildings are getting leased and purchased, and workers are coming back to the office. We have work to do, and we would welcome continued partnerships with the FBI, DEA, ATF, and U.S. Attorney to get drugs and drug dealers off our streets, but having the military and militarized immigration enforcement in our city will hinder our recovery.\"\n\nNeither Lurie's office nor DHS responded to requests for further details.\n\nThe resolution appeared, for now, to decrease mounting tensions among San Francisco leaders and the Trump administration, which has targeted Democrat-led cities for increased immigration enforcement, including Los Angeles, Washington, Boston and Chicago. Trump has sent National Guard troops to several cities, while others, including Chicago and Portland, have won temporary reprieves in court against the president's Guard deployments.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) said this week that the state would sue the Trump administration if the president attempts to direct military troops into San Francisco.\n\nSan Francisco is one of the nation's longest-standing sanctuary jurisdictions, having approved policies in 1989 that limit local cooperation with civil immigration enforcement. Former city leaders, including Newsom, who served as mayor, and former vice president Kamala Harris, a onetime San Francisco city attorney, have used their positions to vault into national prominence, with both of them viewed as potential 2028 presidential candidates.\n\nLurie has sought to avoid directly antagonizing the president, a strategy that has engendered criticism from some civil rights groups who say he has not been forceful enough. He has sought to portray San Francisco as a city that has made significant strides in reducing violent crime and homeless encampments, mitigating the need for federal intervention.\n\nIn a live video address Wednesday, Lurie said he had signed an executive directive to ensure that local police abide by sanctuary policies that prohibit them from assisting in civil immigration and respect the free speech of residents who protest the Trump administration's actions. He warned that the administration was aiming to provoke \"backlash, chaos and violence\" in American cities.\n\nBenioff sparked outrage among San Francisco leaders two weeks ago by saying he would support sending National Guard troops to the city. He later apologized for the comments and said he no longer believes such tactics are needed to address safety issues.\n\nDemocratic Reps. Nancy Pelosi and Kevin Mullin, who represent California districts that cover San Francisco, warned that federal agents could face arrest if they break California law.\n\n\"California law protects communities and prevents federal agents from taking certain actions here that we have witnessed in other states. While the President may enjoy absolute immunity courtesy of his rogue Supreme Court, those who operate under his orders do not,\" they said in a statement Wednesday. \"Our state and local authorities may arrest federal agents if they break California law -- and if they are convicted, the President cannot pardon them.\"", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2025/10/23/san-francisco-trump-federal-deployment/"}

We're seeing him allow the Pentagon to restrict the way its staff and personnel engage with Congress.\n\nOn Wednesday, we learned that Trump carried out his eighth extrajudicial strike on a boat that he claimed, without evidence, was smuggling drugs. No trial, no investigation, no attempt by the Coast Guard to intervene -- just summarily executing people, guilty or not, because Trump said so.\n\nIf any of that was too subtle, this week the president began literally tearing apart the physical foundations of the executive branch -- demolishing the entirety of the historic East Wing of the White House without consultation with any review agency, without consultation with the American people and against even his own promise not to do exactly this.\n\nTo me personally, this is an absolute gut-punch. Not just because of the history of the building and the hundreds of thousands of guests who have visited the People's House and walked down the long hallway looking at the photos of former presidents and their families, but because Trump is only doing this because he is an insecure man-baby who wants a gaudy new ballroom that looks like a gilded event space from his club in Palm Beach, Fla., to boost his own fragile ego.\n\nTo paraphrase the president himself, nobody in our country has ever seen anything like this before. The kind of authoritarian power grab we're seeing from Trump right now is an entirely new challenge. That means it will require an entirely new response.\n\nBusiness as usual is not going to work. Strongly worded letters are not going to work. This moment is going to take new and creative forms of resistance from a broad swath of people to push back on it.\n\nThat is what elected officials like Merkley have tried to do. Luckily, he is not alone.\n\nOn Wednesday, we saw California Gov. Gavin Newsom send a clear message about what the National Guard is supposed to be used for, announcing that he is deploying his state's forces, not to crack down on peaceful dissent like Trump, but to support local food banks that are seeing a spike in demand after the government shutdown cut access to critical food assistance.\n\nOn Tuesday, we saw Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes sue Congress to stop Trump and his allies from preventing a duly elected Democratic representative from being sworn in to do the job she was elected to do. It's a case that could be precedent-setting and could prevent House Speaker Mike Johnson from delaying swearing in future members of Congress just over a year from now, after the midterm elections.\n\nAlso on Wednesday, we saw two former deputies to special counsel Jack Smith announce that they are not joining law firms that made deals with Trump. Instead, they've started their own, where they aim to assist \"state and local law enforcers who want to be more aggressive in investigating public officials suspected of abusing their positions for personal gain.\"\n\nNow, each of these acts of defiance is small on its own, and it's unlikely that any single one will be a game-changer overnight, but taken together, the acts start to add up and become real pushback. And not every action has to be a sweeping, headline-grabbing spectacle or come from an elected official.\n\nIn Chicago, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents have started arresting tamale vendors whom they suspect of being undocumented. In response, a brigade of cyclists started riding around to the vendors across the city and buying up their entire supply of tamales so that they could avoid getting snatched by ICE and still make a living.\n\nAnother group in Chicago has been passing out whistles to community members so that they can alert their neighbors whenever ICE shows up.\n\nIn Portland -- the city that Trump has tried to claim is overrun with violent and dangerous protesters -- a couple decided to hold their wedding outside an ICE facility, with the bride, the groom and all the guests dressed in wacky inflatable costumes to demonstrate the joy and whimsy of that city's peaceful demonstrations.\n\nOn Tuesday in North Carolina, people showed up in droves to protest the Trump-backed plan to redraw that state's congressional maps. Protests and activism in Indiana and Missouri have been making it harder for Republicans to go through with their redistricting plans in those states, as well.\n\nIn New York's Chinatown, local citizens surrounded ICE officials in an impromptu protest, as agents conducted a surprise raid on the neighborhood's street vendors.\n\nAnd of course, this past weekend we saw, according to estimates from organizers, 7 million people across the country turn out to protest this administration -- not just in big cities, but in tons of smaller communities.\n\nThe lesson here is that, in a moment when it's hard to know exactly what to do, the only answer is to do something -- to try anything and everything. That is the lesson that compelled Merkley to hold the floor of the U.S. Senate for 22 hours and 37 minutes.", "url": "https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-resistance-pushback-creativity-jeff-merkley-rcna239343"}

Gavin Newsom. The two Democrats said the surge is meant to provoke violent protests.\n\nCBP did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press. A statement provided to media by the Coast Guard said in part that \"through a whole of government approach, we are leveraging our unique authorities and capabilities to detect, deter, and interdict illegal aliens, narco-terrorists, and individuals intent on terrorism or other hostile activity before they reach our border.\"\n\nSoon after the deployment was first reported, Lurie livestreamed a nine-minute statement from City Hall, flanked by other elected officials, and cautioned against giving federal officials working from \"a playbook\" any excuse to crack down. President Donald Trump has repeatedly said he plans to deploy National Guard troops to the city to quell crime, but his administration hasn't offered a timeline for doing so.\n\n\"In cities across the country, masked immigration officials are deployed to use aggressive enforcement tactics that instill fear so people don't feel safe going about their daily lives,\" Lurie said. \"These tactics are designed to incite backlash, chaos and violence, which are then used as an excuse to deploy military personnel.\"\n\nAs is his custom, Lurie did not refer to the president or address him by name.\n\nTrump has deployed the Guard to Washington, D.C., and Memphis, Tennessee, to help fight what he says is rampant crime. Los Angeles was the first city where Trump deployed the Guard, arguing it was necessary to protect federal buildings and federal agents as protesters fought back against mass immigration arrests.\n\nHe has since said they are needed in Chicago and Portland, Oregon, as well, although lawsuits by Democratic officials in both cities have so far blocked troops from going out on city streets.\n\nTrump recently renewed his musings about sending the Guard to San Francisco, saying in a Fox News interview Sunday that the city \"was truly one of the great cities of the world\" before it went \"wrong\" and \"woke.\"\n\nHis assertions of out-of-control crime in the city of roughly 830,000 has baffled local and state leaders who point to statistics showing that many crimes are at record lows.\n\nNewsom's administration said it would push back forcefully on any deployment, as it did when Trump first ordered the guard into Los Angeles against the governor's wishes. California Attorney General Rob Bonta vowed to \"be in court within hours, if not minutes\" if there is a federal deployment, and San Francisco City Attorney David Chiu has promised the same.\n\nAt a news conference Wednesday, Newsom held up what he said was a lawsuit the state would file if Trump sends troops to San Francisco.\n\n\"We're going to be fierce in terms of our response,\" said Newsom, a former mayor of San Francisco. \"This is the lawsuit that I will file within a nanosecond of any efforts to send the military to one of America's great cities.\"\n\nThe Coast Guard base in Alameda that is hosting the CBP agents is between Oakland and San Francisco, both sanctuary cities that do not cooperate with the federal government on civil immigration operations. A Homeland Security statement said the agency is \"targeting the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens - including murderers, rapists, gang members, pedophiles, and terrorists.\"\n\nLurie urged the public to protest peacefully. He said he had just signed an executive directive to coordinate the city's response to a potential federal deployment and provide support for immigrants.\n\nOakland Mayor Barbara Lee issued a statement saying: \"Real public safety comes from Oakland-based solutions, not federal military occupation.\"", "url": "https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2025/oct/23/federal-agents-sent-san-francisco-area-mayor-daniel-lurie-says/"}

Dionne Jr. and the former host of NPR's \"All Things Considered\" Robert Siegel to discuss and debate Zohran Mamdani's mayoral run, gerrymandering and what the No Kings protests achieved.\n\nBelow is a transcript of an episode of \"The Opinions.\" We recommend listening to it in its original form for the full effect. You can do so using the player above or on the NYTimes app, Apple, Spotify, Amazon Music, YouTube, iHeartRadio or wherever you get your podcasts.\n\nThe transcript has been lightly edited for length and clarity.\n\nRobert Siegel: I'm Robert Siegel, now a contributor to Times Opinion. I'm in conversation with two old friends, both of The New York Times. Columnist David Brooks: How are you?\n\nDavid Brooks: How are you?\n\nRobert Siegel: And contributing Opinion writer E.J. Dionne.\n\nE.J. Dionne Jr.: Great to be with you, always.\n\nSiegel: Once again, we're together to talk about politics -- and there is no shortage of things to talk about. Last month we started off with the question of authoritarianism. Do all the various claims of new presidential powers amount to a loss of fundamental liberties? Well, it seems that several million Americans think so.\n\nThey turned out all around the country to protest against kings. So let's start there.\n\nE.J., what did you make of the No Kings protests? What did you see in it? And what did you make of the reactions to it?\n\nDionne: Well, I went down to the one here in D.C., and what I saw was patriotism.\n\nThe symbol that was most on offer everywhere along the march route was the American flag. There was even one part of the march where a bunch of people respectfully held out a very large American flag, and little kids were running underneath the flag -- because there were a lot of kids there with their parents. It was a very, if I may say so of a march in D.C., a Middle American march.\n\nI think you saw that in a lot of parts of the country. And I think it put the lie to something that I found really disturbing from Speaker Mike Johnson -- and others on the Republican side said this -- they referred to it as the Hate America rally. It couldn't have been more different than that.\n\nSince we are on authoritarian watch here, I think it was such a disturbing thing for him to say, because if you are opposed to his party or opposed to the president he supports, that means you hate America. One party, one leader, one country is something that our soldiers fought against in many wars. That's not a conception of Americanism.\n\nA lot of those people who were marching were very aware of the acceleration of the move toward authoritarianism. You think of the prosecution, the indictments of James Comey, Letitia James, John Bolton -- the first two utterly without reason, except that the president hates them.\n\nI think the people at this march weren't ideological. They were just deeply concerned about the direction of the country.\n\nSiegel: Well, David, you called for a national movement as what we need -- first in a column back in the spring, and most recently in a longer piece in The Atlantic. Is the No Kings movement the movement you had in mind? Does it fit the bill?\n\nBrooks: It's getting there. It's weird for me; I'm not a movement guy -- I'm more conservative than not, and now I find myself reading Saul Alinsky and all these lefties. I'm going, \"Yeah, power to the people.\" So I'm going total revolutionary here.\n\nDionne: It's about time, David. [Laughs.]\n\nBrooks: What I liked about No Kings rallies was just what E.J. mentioned: that people like me, who are kind of center right, would feel completely at home there.\n\nIf it starts looking like Occupy Wall Street, then I think: Good for you people, but it's not for me. I'm hanging around Occupy and my hair starts falling out. But around No Kings, I just feel it's pro-American. It's basically in line with the cultural DNA of this country. So I'm very impressed by it.\n\nI think a couple of reservations I have -- not criticisms, but things that are not yet there -- if you look back at social movements that have succeeded, they're decentralized. They happen all over, but there are always central collaborating committees. You look at the civil rights movement and they had the N.A.A.C.P., all these acronyms of all these organizations who were leading.\n\nSecond, I do think you need leaders, and I think sometimes, like Occupy, people are averse to having one person at the top. But without that, you can't control your message. You can't really conduct a strategy.\n\nThe civil rights movement conducted a soap opera every day. They told the story every day about segregation, and through that repeated storytelling, you really built the movement. You gave the segregators an unwinnable proposition. When you control the streets, either they cede the streets to you or they crack down on you and look like monsters. And that's a way to achieve civic power.\n\nThe final thing that I think No Kings is so far not making is a vision. Donald Trump has a vision. Trump is a culture. He has a core story: The elites have betrayed you. But he doesn't only have that story. He has a culture of MAGA, a culture of what a man looks like, what a woman looks like. He has a religion, basically, if you looked at the Charlie Kirk memorial service. He gives you identity. He gives you belonging.\n\nIt takes a counterculture to best the culture that Donald Trump is leading. And so far, the Democrats don't have that; they have a bunch of tax credits. And so far, the No Kings movement doesn't have that.\n\nDionne: There was a lot of stuff in your piece I appreciate. I particularly like the line where you said Trumpism is seeking \"to amputate the higher elements of the human spirit -- learning, compassion, science and the pursuit of justice, and supplant those virtues with greed, retribution, ego and appetite.\"\n\nThere's some very good stuff here.\n\nBut I'll tell you where I take issue with you. You talked about a miasma of passivity that seems to have swept over the anti-Trump ranks. I don't think that's true at all. I think that you've seen this movement grow.\n\nI think that what is making things difficult is, in our history, I think it's fair to say that we have never confronted a government that was willing to break the law as freely -- not just break norms, which they haven't cared about for a long time, but break the law as freely.\n\nWe haven't seen a situation where all of the institutions of government are behaving in a partisan way. The Congress is behaving in a partisan way. And on many of these cases, most so far, the Supreme Court is behaving in a partisan way.\n\nSo people are trying to find purchase here. Where we partly agree is on this need for a strong movement across the country.\n\nI read a very good book this week by Suzanne Mettler and Trevor Brown called \"Rural Versus Urban.\"\n\nI think that you need to revisit organizing all the way down in the country, and you need to put pressure on Republicans. Because until some of the Republicans who clearly know better are willing to say so, it's going to be very hard to break this power that Trump is amassing.\n\nBrooks: Well, he has the core story that people believe in: The elites have betrayed you. The passivity I was talking about was not so much at the bottom, though. I do think it's there. It's at the top.\n\nDionne: There, I agree with you.\n\nBrooks: It's the head of the companies, it's the head of universities, the head of law firms. They're just lying low -- in part because they're intimidated, in part just because of the collective action problem. Who's going to step out first?\n\nI had a friend, a business leader, who went to Europe and he said, \"We've lost faith in the United States forever.\" And I said, \"It's like Taylor Swift: 'We are never getting back together.'\"\n\nAnd the European said something interesting: It's not because you elected Trump. We all have Trumps in our countries, so any country could do that. It's because you didn't rise up.\n\nHe's looking at his business leaders, and he's seeing them say something in private about how awful things are going, and then in public speaking a very different language. And you can measure the amount of authoritarianism in a country by how high the price is to oppose it.\n\nDionne: Totally agree about a lot of business leaders, but let's look at some real pushback. Some law firms went over to Trump, but a whole lot of law firms said: We are not going there.\n\nThey went after Jimmy Kimmel, a whole lot of people protested, and Jimmy Kimmel was put back on the air.\n\nA lot of universities are saying no to what Trump is doing. So I totally agree with you that I want more pushback from people at the very top of the economy, but I think you're seeing seeds of revolt that are very useful.\n\nSiegel: But let me ask you both this: David, your article made me think back to the civil rights movement and my extremely minute role as a onetime member of the Stuyvesant High School Friends of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee.\n\nDionne: God bless you.\n\nSiegel: The civil rights movement achieved a major Civil Rights Act, the Voting Rights Act, constitutional amendment against poll taxes. After the restoration of the Medicaid tax break, I don't know what the agenda of the No Kings movement is. I assume they can't enact it now, but I don't even know what would be on the wish list.\n\nBrooks: I think that's the wrong way to think about it, with all due respect to my friend. You went to Stuyvesant High School. That shows you're smarter. [Laughs.]\n\nBut I don't think the anti-Trump forces understand the nature of the fight, which is that Trumpism didn't emerge overnight. It started, in some ways, back in the 19th century, with Know Nothing.\n\nBut it really started with people like Sam Francis and Christopher Lasch with his book \"The Revolt of the Elites.\" There was a big intellectual movement, and Trump just picked up everything Christopher Lasch wrote in that book in 1995. So what you need is a whole movement and a vision, and it has to be intellectual first.\n\nWhat I think Democrats need to do is understand that they can't go back to their core narratives. Democrats have had some great narratives. The New Deal: We're going to soften capitalism and make it more humane. In the 1960s: We're going to take people who've been marginalized and we're going to give them respect. Those are great narratives, but they're not narratives right now.\n\nThe final thing I'd say is there's a Bulgarian political scientist who made the observation that once the revolution happens, everybody changes. So, it's not just the Republican Party. He makes a point that the Democratic Party is going to change just as much as the Republican Party. And then he makes the point that once the revolution happens, you can't go back to who you were.\n\nHe phrases it this way: \"You can have Kerensky before Lenin, but you can't have Kerensky after Lenin.\" And Kerensky, for those who didn't go to City College in the 1930s, was a sort of a Democrat before the Russian Revolution. Once Lenin comes along and creates the revolution, you're not going to go back to the moderate Kerensky.\n\nSo I just emphasize how radically different people have to think about where we're going to be in five years.\n\nSiegel: Well, on that note, let's turn to the races that are on the ballot in November. The odd-numbered year after the presidential election always draws our attention to New Jersey and Virginia, which elect a governor in that year, and of course New York City, which elects a mayor in that year.\n\nAnd this year, there's a special interest in a California referendum on congressional redistricting. David, which of these races do you find especially interesting?\n\nBrooks: I'm going to go to where E.J. wants to go, because I am a good friend: Mamdani.\n\nI'm profoundly impressed by how much the Democrats want to be the party of rich people. If you look at how Mamdani did against Cuomo in the primary, Cuomo did very well among working-class voters and Mamdani did very well among workers making $200,000 a year.\n\nHe is a perfect candidate for educated elites. His dad is a professor. His mom's a filmmaker. Nothing wrong with that. My dad was a professor. He has the cultural values and progressive politics that go over well in Prospect Heights or in Park Slope -- these are neighborhoods in New York -- and would go over well in Santa Monica, would go over well in various affluent places.\n\nBut to me, the core problem for the Democrats is they need to win the working class back. And if he's their face, which he is about to be, I just think that's a setback to the core problem for the Democratic Party.\n\nSiegel: But isn't he running against the high cost of living? No one can afford an apartment at the rate things are going.\n\nBrooks: Yeah, but he's doing things that are outside the mainstream. Our colleagues on the editorial board produced a data-strewn editorial, and it was basically about something called the center voter theory -- that you run to the center and you win by running to the center.\n\nThat may not be true in New York, because New York has a lot of rich progressives, but it's generally true. So running to the center is probably a smart thing to do.\n\nDo Mamdani's ideas appeal to me? No. I don't think government knows how to run a grocery store. New York already has a lot of great family grocery stores. That's one of the beauties of New York: There are bodegas everywhere. His ideas sound good if you haven't lived through socialism, but socialism is still socialism.\n\nDionne: I find it amazing, David, that you're saying that the richest people in New York support Mamdani.\n\nI wish I could do a really good Bernie, but \"the millionaires and the billionaires\" are all supporting Andrew Cuomo over Mamdani. I looked at the great map The New York Times had of the primary -- every precinct facing Central Park except one little one way up in the northwestern corner.\n\nBrooks: I didn't say the millionaires and billionaires. I said $200,000. That's his sweet spot.\n\nDionne: It's sort of $50,000 to $200,000. And I think that what's interesting about Mamdani -- two things.\n\nOne, let's celebrate the paperback of your new book, \"How to Know a Person,\" and Mamdani acts like he read your book.\n\nHow did he start his campaign? He went to the Bronx when he was at 1 percent in the polls and went to precincts where Donald Trump did well or better than a Republican had done in a long time and he asked people: Why did you vote for Trump? Or: Why didn't you vote at all?\n\nWhat did they tell him? They said they were worried about the cost of living. How did he orient his campaign?\n\nYou can argue with this or that proposal, but the entire campaign has been oriented around not cultural issues -- he's a cultural progressive, but that's not what he talks about. He talks about the high cost of housing, he talks about the high cost of child care, the high cost of groceries, the high cost of transportation. He has run an economically based campaign to say New York should be affordable to everybody.\n\nAnd I wrote a column in The Times saying that he was a \"sewer socialist,\" which to many people might sound like I'm running him down, but I was actually building him up. Because the kinds of socialists who have succeeded in American history -- there was a big movement for municipal socialism; Dan Hoan was mayor of Milwaukee for 24 years as a socialist -- focused on fixing problems: fixing the sewers, which are making people sick in working-class neighborhoods.\n\nBernie Sanders, who was a mayor, talked about making sure the snow was picked up in working-class neighborhoods. So, it's snow socialism to sewer socialism. I think he is very grounded and down to earth, and he is running, in an odd way, a campaign that's quite related to that New York Times editorial that you referenced, even though its underlying message was rather different from Mamdani's.\n\nBrooks: Look, I love pragmatic leaders. Mike Bloomberg, he was my version. I think New York worked a lot better after Mike Bloomberg.\n\nThere was a guy in Detroit -- Duggan I think was his name, Mayor Duggan. And he was the least charismatic guy on Earth. But he said: If you want your streetlights to work, I'm your guy. He was just a boring administrator. I love those guys. And so if Mamdani was like that, I'd be all for it.\n\nAnd I should say he's a great campaigner. He's one of the more interesting people in American politics right now. So I don't take that away from him. But he is an ideological person. There's a reason he's a member of the Democratic Socialists of America, which has gone further left. A lot of the people I'd like to run the D.S.A. have all quit.\n\nThen the final thing to be said is he's got to explain why New York is so unaffordable.\n\nHouston doesn't have this problem. If you look at where people are moving, almost every fast-growing state is a Republican state with low taxes and low housing regulations. So people are moving to Tennessee, to Texas, to Florida, to South Carolina, because they create a positive business climate.\n\nNew York has spent all of our lifetimes -- and I grew up there like you; we were in the same housing project -- it's had the rent control. It's had horrible zoning regulations. It's just super hard to build. I think the vacancy rate in New York apartments is like minus zero, so there's just not enough housing.\n\nThis is something I think about all the time. I love a book called \"The Death and Life of Great American Cities\" by Jane Jacobs. Growing up, we were all told she was a hero. She saved the West Village, and that guy Robert Moses, who was putting in all these highways, he was the villain. But now it's looking like Jane Jacobs taught everybody that if you block the government, you can stop them from doing anything.\n\nSiegel: This is to block the Lower Manhattan Expressway from going through.\n\nBrooks: Suddenly, the story looks a little more complicated, because we've had 50 years of blocking all development. And this is the point our colleague Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson make in their book \"Abundance,\" or Yoni Appelbaum in a book named \"Stuck.\"\n\nThe abundance movement is an effort to get some of the zoning regulations reduced, not out of some Reaganite policy, but just because we need to be able to build things anymore. And I have my doubts that somebody that ideological is going to reduce the grip that the government has on the housing market.\n\nSiegel: E.J.?\n\nDionne: What's ironic is that Mamdani actually did an interview with Derek Thompson where he endorsed some of the core principles of abundance, and argued that you judge a government by whether it can deliver, and that he thinks that abundance raises questions that people who want government to work and want government to work on behalf of working people need to address.\n\nSiegel: OK, one other question about Election Day coming up, which is about the California referendum. My question to each of you is: Is gerrymandering OK if the other guy did it first?\n\nDionne: Well, I think the answer is -- the logic of what I'm going to say is yes.\n\nSiegel: Yes is what you'll say.\n\nDionne: I'll give you the answer straight up and then get there. I am, like a lot of people who are for the commissions like the one California cast, I think it would be better -- --\n\nSiegel: You're against politicians selecting their voters rather than voters selecting their politicians.\n\nDionne: Yes. And so, if you had a commission system or some sort of nonpartisan plan of making districts in every state of the country, that would be great. That's what I'm for.\n\nIn the absence of that, when one party -- on the order of the president or the request of the president -- goes and redraws its district lines in Texas to say \"We're going to arbitrarily create five more congressional districts\" and then other states start following and say, \"Well, we'll create more Republican districts,\" then the other side can either say, \"Gee, this is terrible, but we're still for commissions,\" or they can do what the Democrats and Governor Newsom did in California, which is say, \"We're still for commissions, but we're going to draw lines to offset those five so we have a fighting chance in the election.\"\n\nAnd Barack Obama -- who is somebody who's been fighting partisan redistricting and is one of the most effective advocates out for Prop 50 in California precisely because he liked nonpartisan redistricting -- in this circumstance, he regards it as an emergency.\n\nBrooks: You know, there was an essay written by Daniel Patrick Moynihan years ago -- I'm hitting all your sweet spots -- that was called \"Defining Deviancy Down.\"\n\nThis is what it looks like: Donald Trump defines deviancy down. We're redistricting. We're just going to pick our voters. And then Gavin Newsom matches them.\n\nAnd the people who should be offended, by the way, are the voters of California and Texas. If you live in those two states, you are basically being disenfranchised because you will be living in a district where the election outcome is predetermined.\n\nThere should be outrage about this. People fought for their vote, to have the right to vote, and now people don't care. To me, the worst example of defining deviancy down is what we've come to tolerate, just in how our politicians speak and in the crooked ways they rig the map, and suddenly nobody's bothered by this. Where's your dignity, people?\n\nThen the question I would ask E.J. is: Who was right, Obama or Newsom? And I mean Michelle Obama.\n\nShe had this famous comment years and years ago: \"When they go low, we go high.\" Gavin Newsom, maybe it's unfair to him, but the other alternative is: When they go low, we go lower. Put aside morality. What's the smart thing for Democrats to do? It's not obvious to me that sinking to the moral level of MAGA is the right answer here.\n\nIt seems to me, if people want to turn the page on this moment, they're going to want to turn the page in the way -- and this is not a great example -- of Jimmy Carter after Watergate. They're going to want to say: I want somebody so clean, somebody who respects government, somebody who plays by the rules, who will uphold the norms that I remember. And it seems to me that's actually a smarter play for Democrats.\n\nNow, I understand the temptation. You can't hand away the House in 2026. So I understand the temptation. But it seems to me the long-term play here is to go high when they go low.\n\nDionne: Just for the record -- in Texas, the State Legislature is imposing those districts on the people of Texas. In California, they are going to the voters. The voters of California themselves are going to decide in this referendum whether they think this is a necessary thing to do now or not.\n\nMy friend here, of course, always quotes Moynihan for his purposes, but I think that what Moynihan counseled very much throughout his career was political realism. This is not about some abstract argument of who goes lower or higher.\n\nOf course, there's stuff Trump does that no one should do. But in a straight-up political fight where power is at stake and where the authoritarianism we talked about earlier in our conversation really needs somebody to check it, winning that next fight really matters.\n\nAnd again, this proposal they put in California acknowledges that this is not the ideal way to do it. It's a temporary expedient.\n\nBrooks: If I could just say, I've heard this argument that in California the voters get to decide -- and I just don't understand it. There are multiple forms of democracy. We happen to live in a republic, where we elect people to make decisions for us.\n\nCalifornia has this system of referendum where it's a direct democracy. I happen to think that's an inferior form of democracy than electing people who get to make decisions. But it strikes me that Texas is not undemocratic. They're both versions of democracy.\n\nDionne: You started talking about the people, and the people here -- individual voters in California -- will have a say on this question in a way they didn't in Texas. I agree we need a mixed system.\n\nBrooks: We elect congressmen; do I have no say in what my congressman does? No, we elect people.\n\nSiegel: Well, I think we'll just have to accept you guys differ.\n\nDionne: Would you vote for Prop 50?\n\nBrooks: No comment. [Laughs] I would be sorely tempted, to be honest, just in this one case.\n\nSiegel: A great many people cast their votes, not on the basis of either foreign policy or culture war battles but on kitchen table issues -- what's happening with the price of food, price of groceries, with the price of gasoline at the pump.\n\nLife is pretty rough for a lot of Americans right now, and yet the stock market stays in record territory. It keeps setting records. Is the U.S. riding for a fall, and if not, why not?\n\nDionne: It's funny, we were talking this weekend -- transparency for our listeners and viewers -- about the fact that we wanted to talk about this. And right after I hung up the phone, I looked at my email and I had an email from Adam Roberts, an editor at The Economist. It was a newsletter which begins with the words \"You are probably more exposed to a looming market crash than you think.\"\n\nI think there are a lot of people who are extremely nervous. I don't know what's going to happen in the market. I'm a congenital bear who's predicted 10 of the last two downturns. But I do know that there is a real disconnect between what the market has been telling us and the experience of Americans.\n\nTwo really good stories in The Times this week, Sydney Ember wrote a story with the headline \"Lower-Income Americans Are Missing Car Payments,\" and she points out that this is one of the clearest indications that low- and middle-income families -- the economy's foundation -- could be starting to buckle.\n\nThe day before that, Ben Casselman and Colby Smith had a really good piece about how wealthier Americans, buoyed by the stock market, have continued to spend freely, while lower-income households are hit by inflation and weakening of the job market are pulling back.\n\nSo I don't think you can have a successful economy if the middle and the bottom are falling out. The wealthy alone cannot prop up an economy.\n\nCall me nervous, not just about the economy itself. I, again, don't know what's going to happen in the stock market, but this is a very unhealthy situation that explains why so many Americans are discontent.\n\nBrooks: I don't believe in timing the market, but I have been tempted for the past year to call my broker -- --\n\nSiegel: Go to cash [laughs] -- --\n\nBrooks: And pull the vast Brooks fortune out of the market. It'll hurt the market when you lose that much money [laughs]. But I haven't done it, and I'm glad I haven't done it because I've been wrong.\n\nThere are some really solid fundamentals. G.D.P. growth is about 3, unemployment around 4, wage growth around 4, rent inflation is going down. So, there's some good things in the economy. And yet, partly for the reasons E.J. said, and then the economic numbers, and then you look at consumer sentiment -- consumer sentiment is in the basement because people feel rotten about the country.\n\nThen the big issue here, which is that everybody is suddenly talking about if we're on the verge of an A.I. bubble. The reason for thinking we're on the verge of an A.I. bubble are pretty damn obvious: the combined bill. All these big companies, Meta and OpenAI, they're spending on the order of $400 billion or $500 billion a year. The total consumer spending on A.I. is $12 billion.\n\nWhat? You're spending $500 billion next year. And where's the revenue? Then you add the fact that you can't just build a chip plant the way you built a Ford plant, where you can use the machinery for 10 years. It's obsolete in 10 months.\n\nSo you think: Wow, they're just vastly overspending, as they did in the railways, as they did in the early car. We're going to have a big crash, and then A.I. will be fine.\n\nThe counterargument to that is that A.I. revenues, while small, are really going up fast. The second thing is, A.I. is not like any other technology. It's not like the railroads. It's like inventing omniscience. And maybe this is a remarkable opportunity. They all think so, because they're all investing zillions of dollars, but it feels a little bubble-ish to me.\n\nSiegel: Well, I've heard comparisons to the 2000s and the dot-com crash, the bubble. In an article in The Economist, the Harvard professor Gita Gopinath writes that a stock market decline comparable to the 2000 dot-com crash would wipe out, she estimates, $20 trillion in wealth for American households. That's the equivalent of about 70 percent of last year's gross domestic product, and there's just a lot of money out.\n\nBrooks: I am going to call my broker after. [Laughs.]\n\nDionne: Tell him Robert told you to.\n\nSiegel: Well, look, I think we should wrap up, as we did last time, by finding in the midst of all of this angst some joy, some experience that each of us has had recently, that might be a good antidote to stuff we follow in the news. David?\n\nBrooks: Because my wife likes people, we entertain a lot. I've actually found not as many people have people over anymore. We'll have three or four dinner parties a week sometimes, and I'm exhausted by it. I do a lot of dishes. But I found hospitality is maybe my hobby.\n\nIt's certainly a great pleasure to me, and one of the things we do is -- she has a lot of friends who are musicians. And one of my golden rules of life is never turn up the opportunity to hang around with musicians. So we've had a ton of music in the house, and it's been great -- and exhausting. [Laughs.]\n\nSiegel: E.J.?\n\nDionne: I agree with David on all of that.\n\nTwo things. One, this a great time of year for sports fans. You've got the World Series, the N.B.A. starts, middle of football season. That's fun.\n\nBut this weekend I'm going up to New York, and our youngest daughter -- not the one I mentioned the last time -- I'm going to go up to celebrate her birthday, and also walk with her when she early votes in that election in New York that we talked about. And when you can bring together love and democracy, that's utopia for me.\n\nSiegel: I spent Saturday in New York at my grandson's bar mitzvah. I am, to use a technical term, still kvelling. And what added to the joy, actually, were other things that happened to be happening at that synagogue that same morning: the welcoming of two people who just converted to Judaism, and the naming of a newborn. I thought it was a celebration of life at some of its richest moments, and I felt very enriched.\n\nDionne: Mazel tov, that's great.\n\nSiegel: I also feel enriched by hearing from you guys again. E.J. Dionne, David Brooks, Thanks so much.\n\nDionne: Thank you.\n\nBrooks: Thank you.\n\nThoughts?

Now a contributor to Times Opinion. And I'm in conversation with two old friends, both of the New York Times. The columnist David Brooks. How are you? And the contributing opinion writer E.J. Dionne. Great to be with you always. Once again, we're together to talk about politics, and there is no shortage of things to talk about. Last month, we started off with the question of authoritarianism. Do all the various claims of new presidential powers amount to a loss of fundamental liberties. Well, it seems that several million Americans think so. They turned out all around the country to protest against Kings. So let's start there. E.J. what did you make of the No Kings protest? What did you see in it? And what did you make of the reactions to it? Well, I went down to the one here in D.C. and what I saw was patriotism, the symbol that was most on offer everywhere along the march route was the American flag. There was even one part of the march, there were a bunch of people who held respectfully held out a very large American flag, and little kids were running underneath the flag because there were a lot of kids there with their parents. It was a very, if I may say so, of a march in D.C., a middle American march. And I think you saw that in a lot of parts of the country. And I think it put the light as something that I found really disturbing from Speaker Mike Johnson and others on the Republican side said this. They referred to it as the hate America rally. It couldn't have been more different than that. And I think since we are on authoritarian watch here, I think it was such a disturbing thing for him to say, because if you are opposed to his party or opposed to his president, a president he supports, that means you hate America and one party, one leader, one country is something that our soldiers fought against in many wars. That's not a conception of Americanism. And I think a lot of those people who were marching were very aware of the acceleration of the move toward authoritarianism. You think of the prosecution, the indictments of James Commey, Letitia James, John Bolton, the first two utterly without reason, except that the president hates them. And so I think the people at this March weren't ideological. They were just deeply concerned about the direction of the country. Well, David, you've called for a national movement. You say, is what we need first in a column back in the spring and most recently in the longer piece in The Atlantic. Is there no No King's movement? The movement you had in mind, does it fit the bill? It's getting there. It's weird for me. I'm not a movement guy. I'm more conservative than not. And now I find myself reading Saul Alinsky and all these lefties, and I'm going Yeah Yeah, power to the people. So I'm going total revolutionary here. It's about time, David. And what I liked about the King's rallies was just what EJ mentioned, that people like E.J. who were kind of center right, would feel completely at home there. If it starts looking like Occupy Wall Street, then I think oh, good for you people. But it's not for me I'm hanging around occupy and my hair starts falling out, but around no Kings. I just feel it's pro-American. It's basically in line with the cultural DNA of this country. And so I'm very impressed by it. I think a couple reservations I would have, but I think not criticisms, but things that are not yet there. If you look back at social movements that have succeeded, they are decentralized. They happen all over. But there are always central collaborating committees. You look at the Civil Rights movement. They had the N.A.A.C.P., all these acronyms of all these organizations who are leading second. I do think you need leaders. And I think sometimes like occupy, people were averse to having one person at the top. But without that can't control your message, you can't really conduct a strategy. The civil rights movement conducted a soap opera every day. They told the story every day about segregation. And through that repeated storytelling, you really built the movement and you made the segregation laws. You gave them an unwinnable proposition. When you control the streets, either they see the streets to you, or they crack down on you and look like monsters, and that's a way to achieve civic power. The final thing that I think No Kings is so far not making is a vision. Donald Trump has a vision. Trump is a culture. It's a he has a core story. The elites have betrayed you. But he doesn't only have that story, he has a culture of MAGA, a culture of what a man looks like, what a woman looks like. He has a religion. Basically, if you looked at the Charlie Kirk Memorial service, he gives you identity, he gives you belonging. It takes a counterculture to best the culture that Donald Trump is leading. And so far, the Democrats don't have that. They have a bunch of tax credits. And so far, the No Kings movement doesn't have that E.J., there was a bunch a lot of stuff in your piece, I appreciate it. I particularly liked the line where you said Trumpism is seeking to amputate the higher elements of the human spirit, learning compassion, science and the pursuit of justice and supplant those virtues with greed, retribution, ego, and appetite. And there's some very good stuff here, but I'll tell you where I take issue with you. You talked about a miasma of passivity seems to have swept over the anti-Trump ranks. I don't think that's true at all. I think that you've seen this movement grow. I think that what is making things difficult is in our history. I think it's fair to say that we have never confronted a government that was willing to break the law as freely, not just break norms, which they are. They haven't cared about for a long time. But break the law is freely. We haven't seen the situation where all of the institutions of government are behaving in a partisan way. The Congress is behaving in a partisan way. And I think on many of these cases, most so far, the Supreme Court is behaving in a partisan way. So people are trying to find purchase here, where we probably agree is on this need for a strong movement across the country. I read a very good book this week by Suzanne Mettler and Trevor Brown called \"Rural vs. Urban.\" I think that you need to revisit organizing all the way down in the country, and you need to put pressure on Republicans, because until some of the Republicans who clearly know better are willing to say so, it's going to be very hard to break this power that Trump is amassing. Well, he has the core story that people believe in. The elites have betrayed you. The passivity I was talking about was not so much at the bottom, though I do think it's there. It's at the top and they're angry and they're like, the head of the company is the head of universities, the head of law firms. They're just laying low. And it's part because they're intimidated and part just because the collective action problem. Who's going to step out first. And I had a friend, a business leader who went to Europe. And he said, we've lost faith in the United States forever. And I said it's Taylor Swift, we are never getting back together. And the European said something interesting to me. It's not because you elected Trump. We all have Trumps in our country. So any country could do that. It's because you didn't rise up. And so he's looking at his business leaders and he's seeing them say something in private about how awful things are going. And then in public speaking a very different language. And you can measure the amount of authoritarianism in a country by how high the price is to oppose. And I totally agree about a lot of business leaders, but let's look at some real pushback. Some law firms went over to Trump, but a whole lot of law firms said, we're not going there. They went after Jimmy Kimmel and a whole lot of people protested and Jimmy Kimmel was put back on the air. A lot of universities are saying no to what Trump is doing. So I totally agree with you that I want more pushback from people at the very top of the economy. But I think you're seeing seeds of revolt that are very useful. But let me ask you both this. David, your article made me think back to the Civil Rights movement and a my extremely minute role as a one time member of the Stuyvesant High School friends of the Student nonviolent Coordinating. Bless you. And the Civil Rights movement achieved a major civil Rights Act, the Voting Rights Act, a constitutional amendment against poll taxes. I don't even know. After the restoration of the Medicaid tax break, I don't know what the agenda of the No King's movement is. I assume they can't enact it now, but I don't even know what would be on the wish list. Yeah, I think that's the wrong way to think about it. With all due respect to my friend from. I went to Stuyvesant town. You went to Stuyvesant High School. That shows you're smarter. But I don't think the anti-Trump forces understand the nature of the fight, which is that Trumpism didn't emerge overnight. It started back in some ways in the 19th century with know nothing. But it really started with people like Sam Francis, who may be unfamiliar names to Christopher Lasch. His book \"The Revolt of the Elites.\" There was a big intellectual movement, and Trump just picked up everything Christopher Lasch wrote in that book in 1995. And so what you need is a whole movement and a vision, and it has to be intellectual first. What I think Democrats need to do is understand that they can't go back to their narratives, their core narratives. Democrats have had some great narratives. The New Deal, we're going to soften capitalism and make it more humane in the 1960s. We're going to take people who have been marginalized and we're going to give them respect. Those are great narratives, but they're not narratives right now. The final thing I'd say is there's a Bulgarian political scientists who made the observation that once the revolution happened, everybody changes. So it's not just the Republican Party. He makes the point that the Democratic Party is going to change just as much as the Republican Party. And then he makes the point. Once the revolution happens, you can't go back to who you were. And he phrases it this way you can have Kerensky before Lenin, but you can't have Kerensky after Lenin and Kerensky. For those who didn't go to City College in the 1930s was a Democrat before the Russian Revolution. Once Lenin comes along and creates the revolution, you're not going to go back to the moderate Kerensky. And so I just emphasize how radically different people have to think about where we're going to be in five years. Well, on that note, let's turn to the races that are on the ballot in November. The odd numbered year after the presidential election always draws our attention to New Jersey and Virginia, which elect a governor in that year. And, of course, New York City, which elects a mayor in that year. And this year, there's special interest in California, a referendum on congressional redistricting. David, which of these races do you find especially interesting? I'm going to go to where E.J. wants to go because I am a good friend. Mamdani and so I'm profoundly impressed by how much the Democrats want to be the party of rich people. If you looked at how Mamdani did against Cuomo in the primary, Cuomo did very well among working class voters, and Romney did very well among workers making $200,000 a year or whatever. And he is a perfect candidate for educated elites. His dad was a professor. His mom's a filmmaker. Nothing wrong with that. My dad was a professor, and he has the cultural values and the progressive politics that go over well in Prospect Heights or in Park Slope. These are neighborhoods in New York and would go over well in Santa Monica and would go over well in various affluent places. But to me, the core problem for the Democrats is they need to win the working class back. And if he's their face, which he is about to be. I just think that's a setback to the core problem for the Democratic Party. But isn't he running against the high cost of living. No one can afford an apartment at the rate things are going. And yeah, but he's doing things that I think are outside the mainstream. Our colleagues on the editorial page produced a data strewn editorial, and it was basically about something called the centrist voter theory that you run to the center and you win by running to the center. And that may not be true in New York, because New York has a lot of rich progressives, but it's generally true. And so running to the center is probably a smart thing to do. Does Mandani - are his ideas, do they appeal to me? No, no, I don't think government knows how to run a grocery store. New York already has a lot of great family grocery stores. That's one of the beauties of New York. There are bodegas everywhere. And so his ideas, I think they sound good. If you haven't lived through socialism. But socialism is still socialism. I find it amazing, David, that you're saying that the richest people in New York support Mamdani? I wish I could do a really good Bernie, but the millionaires and billionaires are all supporting Andrew Cuomo over Mamdani. I looked at the great map the New York Times had of the primary. Every precinct facing Central Park except one little, one way up in the corner in the North. I didn't say the millionaires and billionaires. I said 200,000. That's his sweet spot. No, it's 50 to 200,000. And I think that what's interesting about Mamdani. Two things. One, let's celebrate the paperback of your book, your new book how to know a person. And Mamdani acts like he read your book. How did he start his campaign. He went to the Bronx when he was at 1 percent in the polls, and went to precincts where Donald Trump did well or better than a Republican had done in a long time. And he asked people, why did you vote for Trump? Or why didn't you not vote at all? What did they tell him? They said they were worried about the cost of living. How did he orient his campaign. You can argue with this or that proposal, but the entire campaign has been oriented around not cultural issues. He's a cultural progressive, but that's not what he talks about. He talks about the high cost of housing. He talks about the high cost of childcare, the high cost of groceries, the high cost of transportation. He has run an economically based campaign to say New York should be affordable to everybody. And I wrote a column in the times saying that he was a sewer socialist, which to many people might sound like I'm running them down, but I was actually building him up because the kinds of socialists who have succeeded in American history, there was a big movement for municipal socialism. Dan Hoan was mayor of Milwaukee for 24 years. As a socialist, they focused on fixing problems, fixing the sewers, which were making people sick in working class neighborhoods. Bernie Sanders, who was a mayor, talked about making sure the snow was picked up in working class neighborhoods. So its snow socialism to sewer socialism. So I think he is very grounded and down to earth and he is running, in an odd way, a campaign that's quite related to that New York Times editorial that you referenced, even though its message, underlying message was rather different from mamdani's look, I would love I love pragmatic leaders. Mike Bloomberg, he was my version. I think New York worked a lot better after Mike Bloomberg. There was a guy in New York, maybe in Detroit. You can help me. Duggan I think it was his name, Mayor Duggan. And he was like the least charismatic guy on Earth. But he said, if you want your street lights to work, I'm your guy. He was like, just a boring administrator. I love those guys. And so if Mamdani was like that, I'd be all for it. And I should say he's a great campaigner. He's one the more interesting people in American politics right now. So I don't take that away from him. But he is an ideological person. There's a reason he's a member of the Democratic Socialists of America, which has gone further left. So a lot of the people I liked who were in the D.S.A. have all quit. And so. And then the final thing to be said is he's got to explain why New York is so unaffordable. Houston doesn't have this problem. If you look at where people are moving, almost every fast growing state is a Republican State with low taxes and low housing regulations. And so people are moving to Tennessee, to Texas, to Florida, to South Carolina, because they create a positive business climate. New York has spent all of our lifetimes, and I grew up there. Like you, we were in the same housing project and has had rent control. It's had horrible zoning regulations. It's just super hard to build. And therefore, I think the vacancy rate in New York apartments is like negative 0. And so there's just not enough housing. And then finally, this one, this is something I think about all the time. I love a book called \"The Death and Life of Great American Cities\" by Jane Jacobs. Jane Jacobs and I grew up and we were all told she was a hero. She saved the West Village and that guy, Robert Moses, who was putting in all these highways. He was the villain. But now it's looking like Jane Jacobs taught everybody. If you sue the government can stop them from doing anything. And so, citizens, to block the Lower Manhattan Expressway from going through. And so suddenly the story looks a little more complicated because we've had 50 years of blocking all development. And this is the point our colleague makes. And Derek Thompson, in their book \"Abundance,\" or Yoni Appelbaum in a book named \"Stuck.\" And so the abundance movement is an effort to get some of the zoning regulations reduced, not out of some Reaganite policy, but just because we need to be able to build things anymore. And I have my doubt that some of that ideological is going to reduce the grip that government has on the housing market. What's ironic is that Mamdani actually did an interview with Derek Thompson where he endorsed some of the core principles of abundance and argued that you judge a government by whether it can deliver, and that he thinks that abundance raises questions, that people who want government to work and want government to work on behalf of working people need to address. O.K, I have one other question about election day coming up. Just one, which is about the California referendum. My question to each of you is gerrymandering O.K. if the other guy did it first. Well, I think the answer is, I guess the logic of what I'm going to say is yes. So I'll give you the answer straight up and then get there. I am like a lot of people who are for the commissions the one California cast, I think. And you're against politicians selecting their voters rather than voters selecting their politicians. And so if you had a commission system or some non-partisan plan of making districts in every state of the country, that would be great. That's what I'm for. In the absence of that, when one party on the order of the president or the request of the president goes and redraws its district lines. In Texas, we're talking about to say we're going to arbitrarily create five more congressional districts, and then other states start following and say, well, we'll create more Republican districts. Then the other side can either say, gee, this is terrible, but we're still for commissions, or they can do what the Democrats and Gavin Newsom did in California, which is say, we're still for commissions, but we're going to draw lines to offset those five. So we have a fighting chance in the election. And Barack Obama, who is somebody who's been fighting partisan redistricting, is one of the most effective advocates out for prop 50 inches California, precisely because he'd like nonpartisan redistricting. But in this circumstance, he regards it as an emergency. There was an essay written by Daniel Patrick Moynihan years ago called I'm hitting all your sweet spots that called \"Defining Deviancy Down.\" Yes. And so this is what it looks like that Donald Trump defines deviancy down with redistricting. And we're going to pick our voters. And then Gavin Newsom matches them. And the people who should be offended, by the way, are the voters of California and Texas. They are you are basically, if you live in those two states, you are basically being disenfranchised because you will be living in a district where the election outcome is predetermined. And so there should be outrage about this. People fought for their vote to have the right to vote, and now people don't care. And to me, the worst example of \"Defining Deviancy Down\" is what we've come to tolerate just in how our politicians speak and the crooked ways they rig the map. And suddenly nobody's bothered by this. And where's your dignity, people. Then the question I would ask for E.J. is who was right, Obama or Newsom. And I mean Michelle Obama - she had this famous comment years and years ago. When they go low, we go high. Gavin Newsom maybe it's unfair to him, but the other alternative is when they go low, we go lower. And so put aside morality. What's the smart thing for Democrats to do. It's not obvious to me that sinking to the moral level of MAGA is the right answer here. It seems to me if people want to turn the page on this moment, they're going to want to turn the page in a little the way they turn the page. And this is not a great example of Jimmy Carter after Watergate. They're going to want to say, I want somebody so clean, somebody who respects government, somebody who plays by the rules, who will uphold the norms that I remember. And it seems to me that's actually a smarter play for Democrats. Now, I understand the temptation. You can't hand away the house in 2026. So I understand the temptation. But it seems to me the long term play here is to go high when they go low. Just for the record, Texas, the state legislature is imposing those districts on the people of Texas. See, California. They are going to the voters, the voters of California themselves are going to decide in this referendum whether they think this is a necessary thing to do now or not. And my friend here, of course, always quotes Moynihan for his purposes. But I think that what Moynihan counseled very much throughout his career was political realism. And this is not about some abstract argument of whether who goes lower or higher. Of course, there's stuff. Trump does that No one should do. But in a straight up political fight where power is at stake and where the authoritarianism we talked about earlier in our conversation really needs somebody to check it. Winning that next fight really matters. And again, this proposal they put in California acknowledges that this is not the ideal way to do it. It's a temporary expedient. If I could just say I've heard this argument before, I just don't understand it, that California, the voters get to decide there are multiple forms of democracy. We happen to live in a Republic where we elect people to make decisions for us. California has this system of referendum where it's direct democracy. I happen to think that's an inferior form of democracy than to electing people who get to make decisions. But it strikes me that Texas is not undemocratic. And so they're both versions of democracy. They started talking about the people and the people here. Individual voters in California will have a say on this question in a way they didn't in Texas. And so I agree, we need people. Do I have no say in what my Congressman does. No we elect people. Well, I think we'll have to just accept that you guys differ about the. Would you vote for prop 50. No comment. No O.K. I would be sorely tempted, to be honest. Just in this one case. In this one case, a great many people cast their votes not on the basis of either foreign policy or culture war battles, but on kitchen table issues, what's happening with the price of food, with price of groceries, with the price of gasoline at the pump. Life is pretty rough for a lot of Americans right now. And yet the stock market stays in record territory, keeps setting records. Is the U.S. riding for a fall. And if not, why not E.J., it's funny, we were talking this weekend and transparency for our listeners and viewers about the fact that we wanted to talk about this. And right after I hung up the phone and I looked at my email and I had an email from Adam Roberts, an editor at The Economist, a newsletter, which begins with the words you are probably more exposed to a looming market crash than you think. I think there are a lot of people who are extremely nervous. I don't know what's going to happen in the market. I'm a kind of congenital bear who's predicted 10 of the last two downturns. But I do know that there is a real disconnect between what the market has been telling us and the experience of Americans. Two really good stories in The times this week. Sydney ember wrote a story, the headline lower income Americans are missing car payments, and she points out that this is one of the clearest indications that low and middle income families, the economy's foundation could be starting to buckle. Day before that, Ben Casselman and Colby Smith, they had a really good piece about how wealthier Americans, buoyed by the stock market, have continued to spend freely while lower income households are hit by inflation, a weakening of the job market or pulling back. And so I don't think you can have a successful economy if the middle and the bottom are falling out. The wealthy alone cannot prop up an economy. So call me nervous, not just about the economy itself. Again, I don't know what's going to happen in this stock market, but this is a very unhealthy situation that explains why so many Americans are discontent. I'm I don't believe in timing the market, but I've been tempted for the past year to call my broker, go to cash -- and pull the vast Brooks fortune out of the market. It will hurt the market when you lose that much money. But I haven't done it. And I'm glad I haven't done it because I've been wrong. And there are some really solid fundamentals G.D.P. growth is about three. Unemployment is around four. Wage growth is around four. Rent inflation is going down. And so there are some good things in the economy. And yet for part of the reasons E.J. said. And then you look at the economic numbers and then you look at consumer sentiment. Consumer sentiment is in the basement. And so people you look at the numbers seems O.K., but consumer sentiment is in the basement because people feel rotten about the country. And then the big issue here, which is what everybody is suddenly talking about are we on the verge of an A.I. bubble. And the reason for thinking we're on the verge of an A.I. bubble are pretty damn obvious. The combined all these big companies, Meta and OpenAI, they're spending on the order of four or $500 billion a year. We have the total consumer spending on A.I. is $12 billion. What, you're spending $500 billion next year and where's the revenue. And now they're obviously. And then you add the fact is you can't just build a chip plant the way you build a Ford plant where you can use the machinery for 10 years, it's obsolete in 10 months. And so you think, wow, they're just vastly overspending as they did in the railways as they did in the early car. We're going to have a big crash and then I will be fine. The counterargument to that is that A.I. revenues, while small, are really going up fast. And the second thing is A.I. is not like any other technology. It's not like the railroads. It's like inventing omniscience. And maybe this is a remarkable opportunity. They all think so because they're all investing zillions of dollars, but it feels a little bubblicious to me. Well, I've heard comparisons to 2000 and dotcom crash. The bubble in an article in The Economist, the Harvard professor Gita Gopinath writes that a stock market decline comparable to the 2000 dotcom crash would wipe out. She estimates, $20 trillion in wealth for American households. That's the equivalent of about 70 percent of last year's gross domestic product. And there's just a lot of money out there. I am going to call my broker after I tell him Robert told you to. Well, look, I think we should wrap up, as we did last time, by finding in the midst of all of this angst, some joy, some joy, some experience that you've had recently that each of US has had recently, that might be a good antidote to the stuff we follow in the news. David, you go first. Because my wife likes people we entertain a lot. And so I've actually found hospitality. Not as many people have people over anymore. And we'll have three or four dinner parties a week sometimes, and I'm exhausted by it. But I do a lot of dishes. But I found hospitality is like, maybe that is my hobby. It's certainly a great pleasure to me. And one of the things we do is she has a lot of friends who are musicians, and one of my golden rules of life is never turn up the opportunity to hang around with musicians. And so we've had a lot ton of music in the house. And it's been great and exhausting. I agree with David on all of that. Two things. One, this is a great time of year for sports fans. You got the World Series. The N.B.A. starts middle of the football season. That's fun. But this weekend I'm going up to New York and our youngest daughter, not the one I mentioned last time. I'm going to go up to celebrate her birthday and also walk with her when she early votes in that election in New York that we talked about. And when you can bring together love and democracy, that's utopia for me. I spent Saturday in New York at my grandson's bar mitzvah. I am, to use a technical term, still kvelling. And what added to the joy, actually, were other things that happened to be happening at that synagogue that same morning. The welcoming of two people who just converted to Judaism and the naming of a newborn. And I thought it was a celebration of life at some of its richest moments. And I felt very enriched. Mazel tov. Mazel tov. That's great. I also feel enriched by hearing from you guys again. E.J. Dionne, David Brooks, Thanks so much. Thank you. Thank you.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/video/opinion/100000010471948/trump-has-a-religion-what-do-democrats-have.html"}

Gavin Newsom. The two Democrats said the surge is meant to provoke violent protests.\n\nCBP did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press. A statement provided to media by the Coast Guard said in part that \"through a whole of government approach, we are leveraging our unique authorities and capabilities to detect, deter, and interdict illegal aliens, narco-terrorists, and individuals intent on terrorism or other hostile activity before they reach our border.\"\n\nSoon after the deployment was first reported, Lurie livestreamed a nine-minute statement from City Hall, flanked by other elected officials, and cautioned against giving federal officials working from \"a playbook\" any excuse to crack down. President Donald Trump has repeatedly said he plans to deploy National Guard troops to the city to quell crime, but his administration hasn't offered a timeline for doing so.\n\n\"In cities across the country, masked immigration officials are deployed to use aggressive enforcement tactics that instill fear so people don't feel safe going about their daily lives,\" Lurie said. \"These tactics are designed to incite backlash, chaos and violence, which are then used as an excuse to deploy military personnel.\"\n\nAs is his custom, Lurie did not refer to the president or address him by name.\n\nTrump has deployed the Guard to Washington, D.C., and Memphis, Tennessee, to help fight what he says is rampant crime. Los Angeles was the first city where Trump deployed the Guard, arguing it was necessary to protect federal buildings and federal agents as protesters fought back against mass immigration arrests.\n\nHe has since said they are needed in Chicago and Portland, Oregon, as well, although lawsuits by Democratic officials in both cities have so far blocked troops from going out on city streets.\n\nTrump recently renewed his musings about sending the Guard to San Francisco, saying in a Fox News interview Sunday that the city \"was truly one of the great cities of the world\" before it went \"wrong\" and \"woke.\"\n\nHis assertions of out-of-control crime in the city of roughly 830,000 has baffled local and state leaders who point to statistics showing that many crimes are at record lows.\n\nNewsom's administration said it would push back forcefully on any deployment, as it did when Trump first ordered the guard into Los Angeles against the governor's wishes. California Attorney General Rob Bonta vowed to \"be in court within hours, if not minutes\" if there is a federal deployment, and San Francisco City Attorney David Chiu has promised the same.\n\nAt a news conference Wednesday, Newsom held up what he said was a lawsuit the state would file if Trump sends troops to San Francisco.\n\n\"We're going to be fierce in terms of our response,\" said Newsom, a former mayor of San Francisco. \"This is the lawsuit that I will file within a nanosecond of any efforts to send the military to one of America's great cities.\"\n\nThe Coast Guard base in Alameda that is hosting the CBP agents is between Oakland and San Francisco, both sanctuary cities that do not cooperate with the federal government on civil immigration operations. A Homeland Security statement said the agency is \"targeting the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens -- including murderers, rapists, gang members, pedophiles, and terrorists.\"\n\nLurie urged the public to protest peacefully. He said he had just signed an executive directive to coordinate the city's response to a potential federal deployment and provide support for immigrants.\n\nOakland Mayor Barbara Lee issued a statement saying: \"Real public safety comes from Oakland-based solutions, not federal military occupation.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Sophie Austin contributed from Sacramento, California", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/federal-agents-san-francisco-area-mayor-meant-incite-126780927"}

These battery energy storage facilities are a huge part of meeting Gov. Gavin Newsom's plan for all electricity sold in California to be renewable by 2045, with a 60 percent benchmark to be met by 2030.\n\n\"So many people were not aware these were even coming to Vacaville,\" said Deanna Cole, a Vacaville resident and organizer of the \"Keep Vacaville Safe\" community movement in response to the proposed battery plants.\n\nCole would neighbor a proposed battery plant near Kilkenny Road by NextEra Energy called the Corby Energy Project, which is seeking state approval from the California Energy Commission right now.\n\nThe company hosted a community meeting on the project in July.\n\nThe project sits just outside of the Vacaville city limits. The Solano County Board of Supervisors in August voted to end their moratorium on BESS facilities, updating an ordinance that now allows BESS proposals as long as they follow outlined safety regulations and if they sit on land zoned for manufacturing or industrial use.\n\n\"We're not just concerned about that project. We are worried about anything that is gonna pop up from here on out,\" said Cole.\n\nCole says the message of \"Keep Vacaville Safe\" is that these lithium-ion battery facilities, when too close to homes or hospitals, bring fire danger and an environmental nightmare.\n\nThe City of Vacaville, which has no current regulations for these types of facilities, laid out its plan Wednesday night for a new ordinance and asked neighbors for their input.\n\nCole and dozens of other neighbors showed up to the meeting to share their thoughts.\n\n\"We are taking all the risk by having this in our community. There is no benefit,\" said one neighbor in public comment.\n\nProject Planner Albert Enault with the city of Vacaville outlined restrictions they want in place for battery plants before more potentially come to town under state approval.\n\n\"I think we have an obligation to make sure Vacaville is not the next Moss Landing. That's a critical point right now,\" said another neighbor who was met with a roar of applause from neighbors in the audience.\n\nIn January, a massive fire erupted at the Moss Landing Vistra Power lithium-ion battery facility in Monterey County, prompting local evacuations.\n\nThe same facility caught fire again a month later.\n\nNeighbors worry that with these plants proposed for Vacaville and Solano County, it's only a matter of time before they cause a wind-fueled, challenging-to-extinguish fire.\n\n\"From every incident that happens across the country, we are learning from every one of those, poring over the after-action reports,\" said Chief Kris Concepcion of the Vacaville Fire Department.\n\nConcepcion says safety is their top priority, but it's not yet possible for them to put together an emergency plan until they know exactly what is coming to Vacaville and when.\n\n\"Before any project comes in here we are gonna monitor very closely and take a look at it and make sure we have a good emergency response plan,\" said Concepcion.\n\nNeighbors fear their home values will go down and their cost of living will go up.\n\n\"I don't want to breathe it, I don't want to see fires, and I don't want to pay triple my home insurance,\" said one neighbor in public comment.\n\nSome neighbors say projects like this could drive them from Vacaville altogether.\n\n\"If things like this pass, we absolutely would sell our home and move,\" a young mother commented, who loves near the proposed Corby Project.\n\nSome suggestions from neighbors on Wednesday night for the ordinance included that these plants should be at least a mile from homes. Right now, the city is suggesting a 300-foot buffer.\n\nOthers said the city should ban lithium-ion batteries altogether, forcing the companies to use what they say are safer energy alternatives. Many also want the sites to sit only in industrial parks, not on farmland.\n\nThe city expects to publish a draft of its ordinance in November.\n\nFor updates on upcoming meetings and proposed facilities, visit the city's web page on BESS projects.", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/sacramento/news/vacaville-draft-city-ordinance-controversial-battery-storage-plants/"}

Based in Washington, he covers immigration policy and politics.\n\nThe Trump administration has made preparations to expand its nationwide crackdown on illegal immigration in the San Francisco area with a team of Border Patrol agents, two U.S. officials familiar with the internal plans told CBS News on Wednesday.\n\nThe officials, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the media, said Border Patrol's operations in the Northern California area could start as early as later this week, but that the timing could shift.\n\nOne of the U.S. officials said the Border Patrol agents would stage at the U.S. Coast Guard base in Alameda, roughly 15 miles from San Francisco. That plan was reported earlier Wednesday by The San Francisco Chronicle. The Department of Homeland Security oversees Border Patrol, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the U.S. Coast Guard.\n\nThe U.S. officials said Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino, one of the most visible faces of the Trump administration's immigration crackdown, is expected to be involved in the operation. Bovino is currently leading Border Patrol arrests in Chicago, where a judge on Monday ordered him to answer questions about agents' use of force during those operations. He also oversaw the agency's controversial immigration raids in the Los Angeles area this summer.\n\nIn a response to CBS News' request for comment, a spokesperson for DHS said, \"DHS is targeting the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens-including murderers, rapists, gang members, pedophiles, and terrorists-in cities such as Portland, Chicago, Memphis and San Francisco. As it does every day, DHS law enforcement will enforce the laws of our nation.\"\n\nIn a video posted on social media Wednesday, California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, denounced the Trump administration's plans, accusing the president of seeking to create \"conditions for anxiety\" in American cities.\n\n\"He sends out masked men, he sends out Border Patrol. He sends out ICE, creates anxiety and fear in the community, so that he can lay claim to solving for that by sending in the Guard in the first place,\" Newsom said.\n\nPresident Trump has recently floated the idea of dispatching federal agents to San Francisco.\n\n\"We're going to go to San Francisco. The difference is I think they want us in San Francisco,\" Mr. Trump said in a Fox News interview that aired over the weekend.\n\nOn Wednesday, San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie said local residents would protest peacefully if the Trump administration uses \"un-American tactics to target immigrant communities\" in the area.\n\n\"This federal administration wants to divide us, but we know San Francisco is strongest when we come together to stand up for each other and our values,\" Lurie added.\n\nAs part of an aggressive expansion in deportation efforts across the country, the Trump administration has deployed teams of Border Patrol agents to large, Democratic-led American cities far away from a U.S. border.\n\nAs federal immigration officers, Border Patrol agents have the legal authority to arrest individuals suspected of being in the U.S. illegally anywhere in the country. However, they have expanded search powers in areas close to a coastal or land border.\n\nIn recent weeks, Border Patrol has been carrying out immigration arrests throughout the Chicago area, sometimes as part of operations at worksites and public places that have garnered local backlash. Earlier in the year, Border Patrol launched a similar campaign in the Los Angeles area, arresting suspected unauthorized immigrants in Home Depot parking lots, car washes and other locations.", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/sacramento/news/border-patrol-in-san-francisco/"}

Noem have vowed in recent weeks to make San Francisco the next target in the administration's immigration crackdown, following major operations in other Democratic-led cities, including Los Angeles, Washington, Boston and Chicago.\n\nThe San Francisco Chronicle reported that more than 100 federal agents, including from U.S. Customs and Border Protection, will begin arriving Thursday to Coast Guard Base Alameda, a move viewed as a prelude to the possible deployment of National Guard troops.\n\nCalifornia Gov.

But we do know this federal administration has a playbook, in cities across the country: Masked immigration officials are deployed to use aggressive enforcement tactics that instill fear,\" Lurie said.\n\nThe Trump administration, he said, aims to provoke a violent reaction from local communities that is \"then used as an excuse to deploy military personnel.\"\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security did not respond directly when asked for comment about potential immigration enforcement actions in San Francisco. The agency issued a statement that it is \"targeting the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens -- including murderers, rapists, gang members, pedophiles, and terrorists -- in cities such as Portland, Chicago, Memphis and San Francisco. As it does every day, DHS law enforcement will enforce the laws of our nation.\"\n\nSan Francisco is one of the nation's longest-standing sanctuary jurisdictions, having approved policies in 1989 that limit local cooperation with civil immigration enforcement. Former city leaders, including Newsom, who served as mayor, and Kamala Harris, a onetime San Francisco city attorney, have used their positions to vault into national prominence, with both of them viewed as potential 2028 presidential candidates.\n\nLurie, flanked by City Attorney David Chiu, interim police chief Paul Yep and other officials, sought to portray San Francisco as a city that has made significant strides in reducing violent crime and homeless encampments, mitigating the need for federal intervention.\n\nRather, he said, a surge of federal law enforcement would make residents feel unsafe and \"hinder our progress and let chaos get in the way of our recovery. This doesn't make our city safer. It terrorizes our community.\"\n\nLurie did not mention Trump by name during his remarks. Since taking office, he has sought to avoid directly antagonizing the president, a strategy that has engendered criticism from some civil rights groups who say he has not been forceful enough.\n\nThe mayor met with several dozen civic leaders after his video address to personally brief them on his plans.\n\n\"I was excited that the mayor continues to bring everyone together and there was palpable energy to resist the unlawful military actions of the federal administration,\" said Vincent Pan, co-executive director for Chinese for Affirmative Action, a San Francisco-based social justice organization. Pan called on residents, government officials and local business leaders \"to be more courageous and creative in our leadership than we ever have before.\"\n\nIn his public remarks, Lurie encouraged residents to protest the administration's actions but cautioned them to do so nonviolently.\n\n\"I want to be crystal clear: Violent behavior toward officers or destructive behavior toward local businesses will not be tolerated,\" Lurie said. \"If federal officials come to incite chaos on the streets of San Francisco, the way to support our communities and keep everyone in our city safe is to make our voices heard peacefully. Violence and destruction will only open the door to a more aggressive response and that puts our communities at greater risk.\"", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2025/10/22/san-francisco-ice-cbp-immigration/"}

He announced the directive following word on Wednesday that more than 100 U.S. Customs and Border Patrol agents were being deployed to Coast Guard Base Alameda in an apparent escalation of federal immigration enforcement in the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\nLurie's directive includes the activation of an Incident Coordination Call by the city's Department of Emergency Management to coordinate response and information sharing among city departments. In addition, the order directs the City Attorney's Office to monitor developments and pursue legal action against the Trump administration when necessary, and to include the San Francisco Unified School District in interdepartmental coordination to support immigrant students and families.\n\n\"We have longstanding sanctuary policies in our city that prohibit local law enforcement from assisting federal immigration enforcement,\" said Lurie. \"Those policies help build trust between police and communities, and they help keep people comfortable reporting crimes ... We can't prevent federal officials from enforcing immigration laws, but we're going to keep our local law enforcement focused on ensuring your safety.\"\n\nThere was no immediate word on what type of operations the CBP agents would be carrying out. CBS News Bay Area has reached out to CBP for more information on the mission. Two U.S. officials told CBS News that Border Patrol official Gregory Bovino is expected to be involved in the operation. He's currently leading Border Patrol arrests in Chicago, and oversaw the agency's controversial raids in Southern California this summer.\n\nCBP is the largest federal law enforcement agency of the Department of Homeland Security and is the country's primary border control organization.\n\nThe Alameda Police Department released a statement on Wednesday saying it was not a part of the operation, and that the department does not enforce federal immigration laws or related civil warrants. Alameda police also urged people to avoid interaction with federal law enforcement and referred residents to the city's website for resources and information on immigrants' rights.\n\nOakland Mayor Barbara Lee issued a statement Wednesday, saying the city was actively monitoring the situation.\n\n\"Oakland remains a proud sanctuary city committed to standing with our immigrant families, \" said Lee. \"We will notify our community with as much information as possible about any federal deployment. Real public safety comes from Oakland-based solutions, not federal military occupation.\"\n\nThe developments come on the same day Gov. Gavin Newsom announced he would deploy the state National Guard to help staff food banks amid the ongoing government shutdown. Newsom said the National Guard would not be acting as law enforcement during the mission, mirroring his deployment of the Guard in the early days of the COVID pandemic, also in support of food banks.\n\nOn Sunday, President Trump reiterated his pledge to send National Guard troops to San Francisco, on the heels of his deployments of Guard troops to Portland, Chicago and Los Angeles. Newsom and California Attorney General Rob Bonta have vowed to immediately file suit against the Trump administration should Mr. Trump send federalized National Guard troops into the city.\n\nTrump has argued that troop deployments to U.S. cities are necessary because of what he characterizes as high levels of crime and unrest, as well as shielding federal agents from attacks during immigration enforcement operations. California, Illinois and Oregon have sued the Trump administration over the deployments, arguing they are politically motivated and violate state sovereignty, that there is no insurrection to justify them, and they violate the Posse Comitatus Act, which prohibits using the U.S. military to enforce domestic laws except where expressly authorized by Congress.", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/sanfrancisco/news/san-francisco-mayor-lurie-cbp-agents-deployed-immigration-enforcement/"}

Gavin Newsom said Wednesday he will deploy National Guard troops to support food banks in November, a move that comes in light of anticipated delays to federal food assistance amid the government shutdown.\n\nAbout 40 million low-income people across the U.S., including roughly 5.5 million in California, receive federal food assistance through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, formerly known as food stamps. But Newsom, a Democrat, warned families should expect an interruption to those benefits next month.\n\n\"This is serious, this is urgent - and requires immediate action,\" he said.\n\nThat's a starkly different mission from President Donald Trump's deployment of California National Guard troops to guard federal buildings and immigration agents in Southern California as part of his mass deportation agenda. He's also deployed or tried to send guard troops to Chicago, Washington, D.C., and Portland, Oregon.\n\nNewsom, Trump's longtime political rival, has fought the president's deployment of troops to Democrat-run cities, saying last month that Trump can't \"trample a state's power to protect its people.\" A federal appeals court heard arguments Wednesday on Trump's deployment of troops to Los Angeles. A lower court judge ruled that the federal government violated federal law.\n\nNewsom said he's fast-tracking $80 million for food banks in nearly every county in the state.\n\nThe governor's office said he's building off of his efforts to combat food insecurity during the COVID-19 pandemic. Newsom ordered the National Guard and volunteers from a state-run program in 2020 to work with food banks across the state to identify needs. Troops helped pack and deliver 800 million meals to people, Newsom's office said. The governor will share additional details on the new effort as Nov. 1 approaches.\n\nTrump's big tax breaks and spending cuts law also set new rules for the federal program also known as SNAP, requiring more people to work to receive food assistance.\n\nThe California Immigrant Policy Center is concerned that Newsom's plan could inadvertently have a chilling effect due to Trump's National Guard deployments, said Josh Stehlik, the advocacy group's policy director. But Stehlik was pleased to see the governor say that guard would not be acting as law enforcement.\n\n\"It makes sense to mobilize the National Guard for the humanitarian purpose of delivering much needed and critical food assistance to people during an emergency that's been caused by the federal government shutdown,\" Stehlik said.\n\nVolunteers through a state-run program will also provide support to food banks.\n\n\"During this critical time as DC strips communities of vital resources, Californians are doing what we always do - which is step up for each other,\" said Josh Fryday, director of the Governor's Office of Service and Community Engagement, which oversees the program.", "url": "https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2025/oct/22/national-guard-california-support-food-banks-due-expected-food/"}

John Sauer wrote in a Supreme Court filing Tuesday.\n\nLawyers representing Chicago and Illinois have asked the Supreme Court to continue to block the deployment, calling it a \"dramatic step.\"\n\nAn appeals court said Monday that Trump could take command of 200 Oregon National Guard troops, but a separate court order still blocks him from actually deploying them.\n\nU.S. District Judge Karin Immergut, a Trump appointee, issued two temporary restraining orders earlier this month. One prohibited Trump from calling up Oregon troops so he could send them to Portland. The other prohibited him from sending any Guard members to Oregon at all after he tried to evade the first order by deploying California troops instead.\n\nThe Justice Department appealed the first order and - in a 2-1 ruling Monday - a 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel sided with the administration.\n\nHowever, Immergut's second order remains in effect, so no troops may immediately be deployed. She has scheduled a hearing for Friday on the administration's request to dissolve that order. Meanwhile, the state is asking the 9th Circuit to reconsider Monday's ruling.\n\nA 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel in Pasadena heard arguments Wednesday related to Trump's deployment of Guard troops to Los Angeles.\n\nA district court found the administration violated federal law when it sent troops to Los Angeles in June after protests over Trump's immigration crackdown.\n\nJudge Charles Breyer handed California Gov. Gavin Newsom a victory on June 13 when he ordered control of California's Guard members back to the state.

More than 300 Guard members have been in the nation's capital supporting Trump's initiative since late August.\n\nA separate federal court hearing centers on a request by District of Columbia Attorney General Brian Scwalb for a temporary injunction to stop the deployments of more than 2,000 guardsmen.\n\nForty-five states have entered filings in that case, with 23 supporting the administration's actions in D.C. and 22 supporting the attorney general's lawsuit.\n\nRepublican governors from several states also sent units to D.C.

But industry data show TV advertising spending -- the main pipeline to voters in the vast state -- dropping off dramatically by Republicans and other critics of the proposal.\n\nThe map pushed by Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom aims to bolster his party's chances of regaining a House majority in 2026 and counter Republican efforts to add more seats in Texas and other states.\n\nVoting began earlier this month and concludes Nov. 4.\n\nOver 1.5 million Democratic mail ballots have been returned so far, outpacing about 853,000 Republican ballots, though that's not surprising in a state where registered Democrats outnumber GOP voters by nearly 2-to-1.\n\nData compiled by advertising tracker AdImpact show Democrats and other supporters have nearly $9 million in ad buys booked on broadcast TV, cable and radio. But opponents have virtually no time reserved, though the data don't include some popular streaming services like Hulu and YouTube or mail advertising.\n\nAccording to AdImpact, supporters have aired nearly $70 million in ads so far, compared to about $31 million from opponents.\n\nThe outcome of the fight over so-called Proposition 50 will have national implications. A Democratic House would menace President Donald Trump's agenda for the remainder of his term, while Newsom is widely seen as a likely 2028 presidential contender who would get a publicity boost within his party for spearheading a plan to sidetrack Trump's conservative playbook.\n\n\"If we lose this election in California it means Democrats have virtually no chance of taking back the House,\" Newsom warned in a recent fundraising pitch to supporters.\n\nEarlier in the campaign the Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC tied to House Speaker Mike Johnson, kicked in a $5 million donation to opponents. But conspicuously, a hoped-for late surge in national Republican dollars has yet to materialize.\n\nInvesting in heavily Democratic California is often seen as a dicey bet for GOP donors, and Republicans are fighting across the country to hold their slim majorities in the House and Senate next year. Trump has mostly kept a distance from the contest in a state he lost in landslides in three presidential elections, but where he also has a loyal conservative base and received more votes than any previous Republican presidential candidate.\n\nCalifornia is home to some of the nation's most expensive media markets. When it comes to money, it's not just a matter of fighting off Newsom's new House map for the GOP -- tens of millions of dollars more will be needed to defend the dwindling number of Republican House incumbents in the state, whether Proposition 50 passes or not.\n\nWith the 2026 midterms approaching and House control on the line, national Republican donors \"are looking at those dollars and thinking where are they needed the most,\" said Tim Lineberger, who was communications director for Trump's 2016 campaign in Michigan and also worked in the former president's administration. With critical House races emerging around the country, those dollars might go elsewhere \"rather than fight what might be inevitable here.\"\n\nBut with millions of Trump voters in California \"it's still an important fight to have in this state,\" Lineberger added.\n\nLongtime Republican strategist Jon Fleishman, a former executive director of the California Republican Party, asked, \"Does the road to the White House or the Senate or the House really run through California?\"\n\n\"If we are not seeing a lot of national money coming in, we may be getting an unfortunate answer to that question,\" Fleishman said.\n\nHow much California's political maneuvering will matter in House control -- even if the new map is approved next month -- is not yet known.\n\nThe proposed California House districts -- crafted by Democrats behind closed doors -- have been designed to add five Democratic U.S. House seats to offset Trump's moves in Texas to gain five Republican districts before the 2026 midterm elections. That could boost the Democratic margin to 48 of California's 52 congressional seats, up from the 43 seats the party now holds.\n\nBut Republicans in Missouri, North Carolina and Indiana are making moves that could add GOP House seats as well -- districts are crafted state by state. Republicans hold a 219-213 majority in the U.S. House, with three vacancies.\n\nThe framework of the race is set, with Newsom depicting the contest as a battle against Trump to save democracy, while Republicans and their supporters decry the proposal as a blatant power grab intended to make the state's dominant Democrats even more powerful while discarding House maps developed by an independent commission.\n\nA handful of Republican congressmen who could see their districts dramatically reshaped have mostly stayed away from the campaign spotlight.\n\nThe single largest donor in the campaign could probably walk through downtown Los Angeles in the middle of the day without getting recognized. Charles Munger Jr. -- son of the late billionaire Charlie Munger, who helped Warren Buffett build Berkshire Hathaway into an investment powerhouse -- has funneled over $30 million into the effort to block Newsom's plan.\n\nMunger, a longtime Republican donor who was instrumental in establishing independent redistricting in the state, says voters need to put aside talk of Trump and look at how Newsom's map would upend representation by carving up districts for political gain.\n\nVoters should ask, \"Is this good for you?\" Munger told reporters recently. \"Do you want to trust these people who drew these maps this way?\"\n\nThe campaign has lured some marquee names -- former Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger has appeared in ads opposing the change, while former Democratic President Barack Obama has endorsed Newsom's proposal. But without a candidate on the ballot, the race has lacked for gripping drama.\n\nTo surpass the 50% mark and win, Newsom and his supporters are hoping to keep the focus on Trump, with the intent of driving up a large turnout of Democratic and other left-leaning voters. Because Republicans make up only 1-in-4 voters in the state, opponents will need to get a heroic GOP turnout while peeling off a slice of Democrats as well as getting an edge with independent voters.\n\nAt a rally last week in suburban Los Angeles opposing the proposal, Republican retiree Anne White lamented that the plan would in some cases create oddly shaped districts that would combine rural and farming areas than tend to lean Republican with liberal coastal cities.\n\n\"Those people have nothing in common with one another,\" White said. While the current districts were established by an independent commission in public hearings, Newsom \"wants to undo all of that.\"", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/fight-new-us-house-districts-california-turn-advertising-126774069"}

He analyzes elections and public opinion through survey research and data science tools. On election nights, he manages the team of experts responsible for projecting winners at the network Data Desk.\n\nIt's a state ballot measure about redistricting, but Proposition 50 has many California voters thinking nationally -- and a lot about President Trump.\n\nThose voting for it overwhelmingly say one reason is for them to oppose the Trump administration -- which they also feel generally treats California worse than other states -- and oppose national Republicans.\n\nOverall, those who see their Prop 50 vote as a national issue are backing it, and that rationale is in turn helping push the \"yes\" side of the measure into the lead.\n\nBy contrast, those who see it more as a state issue are opposed: Those voting \"no\" are driven by a concern that redistricting would shift power away from the state's rural areas and toward the cities and cost the state money. But their views are outnumbered at the moment.\n\nSome of Californians' views on President Trump are in turn driven by their widespread feeling that the administration treats California worse than other states. Only about a third say they're generally treated the same. (Even a quarter of Republicans, who overwhelmingly backed Trump in 2024, feel he treats the state worse than others.)\n\nIn all, and given those national dynamics voters express, it may be little surprise the measure has majority backing overall for the moment in the heavily-Democratic state.\n\nCalifornia's statewide debate on redistricting provides a unique look at a public perspective on the matter, while in many other states where it is being implemented or discussed, it is in the hands of legislatures and governors.\n\nIn sum, those who see it as a national issue are overwhelmingly backing it. Those seeing it more in state terms tend to be opposed.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom has a positive overall job approval from California voters, and is a net-positive for those who consider him a factor and are voting \"yes\" on Prop 50.\n\nHowever, he's even more of a motivating force for the \"no\" side, many of whom are Republicans, and half of whom say he's a reason for them to oppose it.\n\nThe potential dynamics of the proposed redistricting are seen to favor cities over both suburbs and rural areas -- perhaps a function of voters' views on proposed maps, or simply that more of California's Democrats live in and around its cities.\n\nThe argument made by opponents that it would cost the state money has gained some traction in the sense that four in 10 think it will, and it's a prevailing view on the \"no\" side. But that's not enough to sway the overall vote right now. A sizable number of those who think it'll cost money are still voting \"yes\" nonetheless.\n\nFinances, the deportation program, and President Trump\n\nOne reason Donald Trump may be drawing opposition -- besides a low statewide approval rating -- is that California's voters tend to feel his policies are making them financially worse off.\n\nAnd there is majority opposition to his deportation program, even more so than has been the case of late in the nation at large.\n\nThat said, Californians do see the administration's policies reducing the number of border crossings, specifically at California's section of the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nOn the deportation program, there are at least two reasons behind the sentiment: one, most California voters -- and especially those who disapprove of the program -- feel the administration is trying to deport more people than they'd expected.\n\nThe Californians who feel this way overwhelmingly voice opposition to the program. This connection has also been the case in recent months nationally. Hispanic voters, in particular, think the administration is deporting more than they'd expected and are slightly more disapproving of the program than White voters.\n\nThere is also opposition to the administration sending the National Guard to L.A.\n\nThe other factor is the prevailing view that the deportation program is making their local economies weaker. These views are often shaped by partisanship, but they also span areas from people living in both cities and smaller towns.\n\nThis is strongly connected to views of the program overall: those who see it weakening the local economy almost universally disapprove.\n\nMost of California's voters don't think the program is making their own communities safer. It's often a matter of partisanship behind that perception. Republicans say it is making their communities safer, but independents and Democrats do not.\n\nThis CBS News/YouGov survey was conducted with a representative sample of 1,504 registered voters in California interviewed between October 16-21, 2025. The sample was weighted according to gender, age, race, education, and geographic region based on the voter file and U.S. Census data, as well as to 2024 presidential vote. The margin of error is \u00b1 3.8 points for registered voters and \u00b1 3.6 points for likely voters.", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cbs-news-poll-california-prop-50-redistricting-trump/"}

However, they are continuing to ask the U.S. Supreme Court to intervene. The Trump administration is pressing for an emergency order that would let Guard troops be deployed.\n\n\"Every day this improper TRO remains in effect imposes grievous and irreparable harm on the Executive,\" Solicitor General D.

But there ...", "content": "For years, Scott Wiener, a Democratic state senator, has eyed San Francisco's main congressional seat after building significant clout on housing policy and L.G.B.T.Q. rights in California. But there was always a seemingly insurmountable roadblock, and her name was Nancy Pelosi.\n\nMr. Wiener, 55, had long vowed not to run for the seat until Ms. Pelosi announced her retirement. It was partly deferential, as the party establishment has frowned upon challenging a sitting member of Congress. And it was partly practical, as Ms. Pelosi has been revered in San Francisco, especially after she rose to the speakership.\n\nMs. Pelosi, 85, has not yet said whether she will run for a 21st term next year. But Mr. Wiener told The New York Times that he was done waiting, old promises be damned. On Wednesday, he will enter the race.\n\nIt was the clearest sign yet that younger generations of Democrats were prepared to buck convention as their party struggles to reinvent itself after losing control of Congress and the White House last year.\n\n\"The world changes,\" Mr. Wiener said in an interview at a cafe in the Castro District, the San Francisco gay neighborhood where he owns a small condo. \"I made a decision that it makes sense for me to get into the race now because I'm passionate about San Francisco having the best possible representation.\"\n\nThe talk in San Francisco has increased over the past year about whether Ms. Pelosi would retire after representing the city for nearly four decades.\n\nShe wields power, but quietly in the background more than before, as has been the case with California's gerrymandering effort to counter Republicans this year. She remains healthy, but a fall last December on a marble staircase in Luxembourg forced her to get emergency hip replacement surgery. The longer she goes without announcing her 2026 plans, the more speculation rises.\n\nYet Ms. Pelosi remains a political icon in a city known for its powerhouse Democrats, from former Vice President Kamala Harris to Gov. Gavin Newsom and former Senator Dianne Feinstein.\n\nIan Krager, a spokesman for Ms. Pelosi, said she had no comment about her future plans and that she was fully focused on passing Proposition 50, the November state ballot measure that would redraw California's congressional districts. He said Ms. Pelosi also had no comment about Mr. Wiener's decision to enter the race.\n\nMr. Wiener praised Ms. Pelosi and declined to answer most questions about her. He would not say whether she was too old to serve effectively or whether he had told her personally that he would enter the race.\n\nBut he did not hold back when it came to Saikat Chakrabarti, a wealthy, progressive firebrand who filed to run for the seat in February. And Mr. Wiener justified his entrance as a matter of ensuring that the upstart would not become Ms. Pelosi's successor.\n\nMr. Chakrabarti, 39, may be best known for having helped Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez leap from New York City bartender to congresswoman and serving as her first chief of staff. He has hundreds of millions of dollars in personal wealth after being the third employee at Stripe, a tech company that focuses on payment processing.\n\nMr. Wiener said it was clear that Mr. Chakrabarti had the campaign skills and money to be a threat. What he doesn't have, Mr. Wiener said pointedly, is a deep understanding of San Francisco.\n\n\"He has so little connection to San Francisco and really never did anything in San Francisco before he started running for Congress,\" Mr. Wiener said. \"He is trying to buy the seat.\"\n\nMr. Chakrabarti countered on Tuesday that he had lived in the city since 2009 and was running to save democracy. He said the best way to beat back President Trump's \"authoritarian coup\" was to prove that Democrats could address the cost-of-living crisis and win back the support of working people.\n\n\"He's right that, politically, I've done way more in Congress, but that is why I'm applying for a job in Congress,\" Mr. Chakrabarti said.\n\nMs. Pelosi's daughter, Christine Pelosi, has long been considered a possible successor. On Tuesday, the younger Ms. Pelosi texted a photo of herself from the Democratic National Committee's women's leadership forum in Washington. She wore a cream-colored scarf with the Bill of Rights sewn onto it.\n\n\"I'm 100% devoted to passing Prop. 50,\" she texted. \"And being deluged with requests for my scarf.\"\n\nEric Jaye, a longtime San Francisco political consultant, said Mr. Wiener's decision made perfect sense.\n\nHe said that American voters were \"very restive\" and were interested in electing younger, more progressive candidates, such as Zohran Mamdani, the front-runner for New York City mayor. Mr. Chakrabarti could benefit from that tide, he said, so Mr. Wiener needed to jump into the race or risk losing his window forever.\n\n\"He deferred and demurred a long, long time, and I think it got to the point where that was no longer politically sustainable,\" Mr. Jaye said.\n\nMr. Wiener grew up in New Jersey and attended Duke University and Harvard Law School before moving to San Francisco in 1997. He said he was drawn to the city by the promise of living freely as a gay man, though he was also devastated by the deaths from AIDS that he saw all around him and how the federal government had done little about it.\n\nHe said discrimination against gay men back then had parallels today in Mr. Trump's attacks on transgender people, drag queens, immigrants and others.\n\n\"These are people who are just trying to live their lives and be who they are, and they're being treated like human garbage,\" he said. \"We have a responsibility to stick up for them.\"\n\nAfter serving on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, Mr. Wiener was elected to the State Legislature in 2016. He has played a pivotal role in the advancement of bills to accelerate housing construction in California, including legislation enacted this year to allow tall apartment buildings near transit stops over the objections of local officials.\n\nIf Mr. Wiener wins his race, he would become the first gay person to represent San Francisco in federal elected office.\n\nAlmost anywhere else, Mr. Wiener would be considered liberal. But in San Francisco, some progressives have dismissed him as a corporate-friendly Democrat because his laserlike focus on building more housing has benefited developers.\n\nNationally, he has been called by Breitbart News \"California's most radical legislator\" for writing laws that include making California a sanctuary state for transgender people and banning Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents from wearing masks. He said he had regularly received death threats.\n\nHe has not shied away from scrapping with Fox News reporters and conservatives such as Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, Republican of Georgia.

Social media platforms including Facebook and TikTok said they would make those markers visible to users, allowing viewers to know when content was fake and experts to trace its origins.\n\nThe system was supposed to provide a digital ground-truth to help guard against deepfakes disrupting elections or inciting turmoil. Tech companies made it part of their response to government regulators asking for safeguards on AI's power.\n\nBut tests by The Washington Post on eight major social platforms found that only one of them added a warning to an uploaded AI video. That disclosure, by Google's YouTube, was hidden from view inside a description attached to the clip.\n\nMoreover, all of the platforms tested stripped the digital marker from the clip that disclosed it was synthetic, preventing anyone from inspecting its provenance.\n\nAI-generated video now has more disruptive power than ever due to technical advances that allow fake clips to be indistinguishable from real footage and the widespread availability of the technology. Yet none of the platforms tested fully supported the standard for marking AI content that tech companies have touted for years, The Post found.\n\nRecent advances in AI leave online audiences \"beyond the point of being able to cope with the scale and the realism\" of AI content, said Arosha Bandara, a researcher at Britain's Open University who has studied labeling of AI-generated content. A robust system for disclosure is important, he added. A law signed by California Gov. Gavin Newsom last week will from next year require large online platforms to make \"conspicuously available\" any information about a piece of content that could indicate whether it was altered or generated with AI.\n\nThe Post tested the platforms using a video generated with Sora, the powerful new video app launched by OpenAI.\n\nChrista Muldoon, a spokesperson for Google, said the Content Credentials standard for marking media files that The Post tested is one piece of its strategy for giving people access to information on how content was made. \"We recognize adoption will take time and this work is ongoing,\" she said.\n\nMeta, OpenAI, TikTok, Snapchat and X did not respond to requests for comment. LinkedIn and Pinterest declined to comment on the record. The Post has a content partnership with OpenAI.\n\nThe rise of AI has heightened concerns about manipulated or misleading content. In 2021, six companies including Microsoft, Adobe and the BBC partnered to develop Content Credentials, a technical standard for adding metadata to media files disclosing how their content was made.\n\nFiles tagged with Content Credentials have tamperproof metadata, which contains details like the camera model that captured the footage, the software used to edit it or the AI system that generated it.\n\nThe data aims to give \"a peek at the content's history available for anyone to access, at any time,\" according to the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity, the group that oversees the standard. The group lists hundreds of members including chipmakers like Intel, camera manufacturers like Sony and Nikon, news organizations like the Associated Press, tech giants such as Google and Meta and their upstart rivals like OpenAI and TikTok.\n\nBut Content Credentials is a voluntary system, and if social media platforms don't implement the standard, it is effectively useless.\n\nTo test which social media sites fully implement the standard, The Post generated a video with Sora and confirmed that it included the Content Credentials data, which mentioned Sora and included the phrases \"Created using Generative AI\" and \"Issued by OpenAI.\" The same clip was posted to eight social platforms using the default settings for a new post.\n\nNo platform that The Post tested kept the Content Credentials data on the video or let users access it. Only YouTube displayed any indication that the video was not real, but the platform's disclosure was added to the description attached to a video, which is only visible to users who click through. It described the clip as \"Altered or synthetic content\" and did not mention AI.\n\nGoogle, which owns YouTube; Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram; and Microsoft, which owns LinkedIn and OpenAI, are steering committee members of the coalition behind Content Credentials. TikTok is a general member and so was Twitter, until Elon Musk acquired the company and renamed it to X.\n\nTikTok and LinkedIn said last year that they would implement Content Credentials to label AI-generated video. Meta said last year it would use the standard to label AI-generated images, and Pinterest said the same in April this year, but neither said they would add markers to video. Snapchat does not appear to have ties to Content Credentials.\n\nAndrew Jenks, executive chair of the coalition behind Content Credentials, said in a statement that users must have access to \"how content was made, including which tools were used.\" The industry \"must continue evolving our approaches to ensure this level of transparency is both possible and effective,\" he said.\n\nGoogle, OpenAI and other AI firms committed during the Biden administration to developing systems like Content Credentials to \"ensure that users know when content is AI generated.\"\n\nSora, released by OpenAI this month, represents a huge test for the creative and commercial potential of highly realistic AI video -- but also its potential downsides. The app can generate short clips that insert a real person's likeness into just about any scenario. Users can opt to share their likeness for others to include in their creations.\n\nOn a webpage titled \"Launching Sora responsibly,\" OpenAI said it adds Content Credentials metadata to all videos, calling it an \"industry standard signature.\" The Post's tests demonstrate that the industry is not using that standard.\n\nOpenAI also listed other mitigations, which have their own flaws.\n\nThe company adds a transparent logo or watermark to all Sora clips, but suggested it may be eliminated in the future. Services that strip out the watermark have sprung up online, and a version of Sora that software developers can use does not add either the watermark or Content Credentials metadata. Users on the \"pro\" plan can download some Sora-generated videos without watermarks, according to company documentation.\n\nOpenAI also said it embeds invisible authenticity markers into Sora videos and has developed a system that can detect them \"with high accuracy,\" but the tool is for internal use only. Google's SynthID project does something similar, but like Sora's detector, the tool is not available to the general public.\n\nOther companies sell tools that aim to detect manipulated content from patterns in an image or video. These have proved unreliable, and social media platforms have not widely deployed them.\n\nAll the while, the tech industry continues building and releasing products that let anyone generate increasingly convincing video clips in seconds.\n\nResearch by Bandara of the Open University, with Dilrukshi Gamage of the University of Colombo in Sri Lanka, found that labeling content as AI-generated was effective at informing people it was fake.\n\nBut finding a way to reliably provide such labels is proving tricky. \"The potential dystopia is that all content, all video, photography, has to be mistrusted until it can be positively authenticated as being real,\" Bandara said.", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/10/22/ai-deepfake-sora-platforms-c2pa/"}

(Melina Mara/The Washington Post)\n\nIn late July, Barack Ob...", "content": "Former president Barack Obama has launched an urgent behind-the-scenes effort to rally support for California's redistricting ballot measure. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)\n\nIn late July, Barack Obama spoke with his former attorney general, Eric Holder, about how Democrats should respond to President Donald Trump's unprecedented mid-decade push to add five favorable U.S. House seats to protect the Republican majority. They had each spent days conflicted about what to do.\n\nBoth had previously championed nonpartisan redistricting. But they agreed that letting Trump's effort in Texas go unanswered wasn't an option. They kept coming back to a plan from California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) that would offset the move with five new Democratic-leaning seats. Within days, Holder drafted a statement endorsing the proposal and ran it by the former president, who quickly signed off. It marked a stark shift that, in their view, was a sign of the emergency measures they believed were required.\n\n\"We're doing things that kind of go against what we talked about,\" Holder said. But they decided, \"we have to preserve our democracy if ultimately we're going to heal it.\"\n\nThat phone call set in motion an urgent behind-the-scenes effort by the former president to rally support for California's Proposition 50, which is on the ballot in a Nov. 4 special election. If successful, it would mark a concrete countermeasure against Trump's agenda less than a year into his second term -- the kind that Obama has increasingly come to believe is necessary.\n\nObama's involvement in the redistricting fight is a reflection of the deep anxieties he harbors about Trump's second term, according to multiple people familiar with his thinking. It has propelled the ex-president into a more political and public-facing role than he once envisioned. With his enduring popularity and the party still struggling to unite behind new leaders after losing the White House and Congress, no other Democrat commands his level of authority or reach.\n\n\"I think it's really clear that President Obama left office fully intending to play the role that traditionally had been played by former presidents, and that is to go about their interests, professional and otherwise, and leaving the governance up to their successors,\" said Rep. James E. Clyburn (D-South Carolina), a longtime Obama ally. But, he added, \"we are not living in ordinary times. And extraordinary times require extraordinary action.\"\n\nThis article is based on interviews with 19 people, including those close to Obama and Newsom, as well as Democratic strategists and outside advisers, many of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private conversations. Obama declined to be interviewed.\n\nThe ex-president has grown especially worried that some lawmakers and voters are not confronting Trump with the same urgency they showed during his first term -- and that major institutions, including universities and law firms, have too often capitulated to Trump's demands, according to a person familiar with his thinking.\n\n\"We can stand up to this. We can call it like we see it,\" Obama said on a recent podcast. \"We need people who have whatever platforms they have to be able to say, 'no, that's not who we are.'\"\n\nHe has been more pointed in his attacks on Trump in recent weeks and has stepped up his political activity in the run-up to this year's elections on Nov. 4. He filmed an ad for Prop 50 and is scheduled to campaign for Democratic gubernatorial candidates Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey and Abigail Spanberger in Virginia on Nov. 1. And he has been in touch with Newsom's team on additional ways he can help on Prop 50 during the campaign's final push.\n\nTrump, whose political rise was powered by conspiracy theories about Obama's birth certificate, has continued to frequently attack his predecessor. During his second term, Trump has baselessly repeated his assertion that there was \"no doubt\" Obama had committed criminal acts. The White House spent days trying to portray Obama and members of his administration as part of a vast \"treasonous conspiracy\" that tried to thwart Trump's chances in the 2016 election -- prompting a rare rebuke from Obama's office.\n\nObama's goal since leaving office more than eight years ago has been to elevate new leaders and help build a Democratic Party that can survive without him, according to those close to him -- which some Democrats have accused him of failing to achieve when he was president.\n\nThe 44th president has served as a sounding board for several governors, including Newsom, Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania and Wes Moore in Maryland; spoken with candidates such as Zohran Mamdani, who is running for New York mayor, and James Talarico, who is seeking a U.S. Senate seat in Texas; and conferred with several Democrats eyeing a 2028 presidential run. Those conversations have included tactical political advice and candid guidance on the toll a presidential campaign -- and weeks of fundraising on the road -- can take on a family.\n\nBut few tasks have occupied Obama's attention like the redistricting fight, a raw partisan battle he is engaging in after years of loftier, more hopeful rhetoric about bridging divisions. What started in Texas with Trump pressuring Republicans to redraw the map years before it was due for an update has become a national partisan fight pitting red and blue states against each other -- 21 years after Obama gave a speech at the Democratic National Convention declaring, \"There is not a liberal America and a conservative America, there is the United States of America.\"\n\nNow, some Democrats think he should set a more combative tone for the party on other fronts.\n\n\"Beyond redistricting, Obama has been hitting singles when he should be hitting home runs -- making ad hoc statements with no long-term value or more generally staying silent as Rome burns,\" said Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee.\n\nObama's aides say he is choosing carefully when and where to reenter the political arena.\n\n\"Since leaving the White House, President Obama has not hesitated to use his voice when he can drive impact, but he has dedicated his post-presidency to championing the next generation of leaders,\" Eric Schultz, a senior adviser to Obama, said in a statement.\n\nA standard-bearer in a party with a leadership vacuum\n\nObama's plunge into redistricting has no modern precedent, according to presidential historians, who noted that former presidents have largely stayed out of big political battles after leaving office. Obama, who was quieter publicly at the start of Trump's first term, has said he'd speak up whenever a line was crossed -- something he believes has happened far more often in the second term.\n\n\"The redistricting in California was a big step because that was really concrete. It wasn't simply making a speech to rally Democrats or attack the president, when [Obama has] done that before,\" said Julian Zelizer, a presidential historian at Princeton University. \"A lot of Democrats weren't sure where they landed on this, and he made a pretty affirmative statement.\"\n\nBetween July and August, Obama spoke with key architects of the effort, including Newsom and former House speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-California), helping shape the public case for the measure and strategizing how to line up support among California Democrats.\n\nObama's endorsement helped swiftly unite Democrats behind the measure and speed its passage through the California legislature.\n\nMany Democrats say they wish Obama would speak out more often and more forcefully as Trump consolidates power and weakens democratic institutions. The party -- still reeling from sweeping losses in last year's elections -- has at times struggled to regroup or mount a cohesive, effective response to Trump, who polls show is unpopular.\n\n\"He's the closest thing currently to a Democratic standard-bearer because there hasn't been somebody to emerge in the party as the natural leader,\" said Mark Updegrove, a presidential historian and president of the LBJ Foundation.\n\nOn redistricting, some of Obama's most consequential moves happened behind the scenes. As Trump began publicly pressuring Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) to redraw the congressional map for his state -- an idea that initially made some Republicans uneasy -- Newsom and his aides quickly convened attorneys and legal experts to explore California's options.\n\nOne possibility was for the legislature to redraw the map itself, a move that would almost certainly face legal challenges because the state constitution requires nonpartisan redistricting. The other was to put the measure before voters to temporarily change the maps. Newsom and his team concluded that was the more defensible route -- especially because California voters approved a nonpartisan redistricting process in 2008 and 2010.\n\nThat was key to getting Obama and Holder on board. Endorsing Newsom's proposal ran counter to what the National Democratic Redistricting Committee -- the Holder-founded group backed by Obama, which is focused on drawing nonpartisan maps -- stood for. But they felt the response was measured because it was temporary and required a stamp of approval from Californians.\n\n\"Our enduring commitment to fairness does not blind us to reality,\" Holder said in a July 30 statement. \"In this moment steps must be taken to respond to the authoritarian measures being considered in certain states and now so brazenly taken in Texas.\"\n\nQuiet conversations with Newsom\n\nAs Democrats debated publicly whether Newsom's plan went too far -- and risked setting an irreversible precedent -- Obama and his team quietly coordinated with Newsom's office to build support.\n\nPelosi, who was helping Newsom rally California Democrats and raise millions of dollars, spoke several times with Obama, urging an all-hands-on-deck response from the party, according to a person familiar with their conversations.\n\nDemocrats knew selling their voters on a bare-knuckled redistricting power play could be difficult, given that their leaders -- including Obama -- had been preaching the benefits of nonpartisan redistricting for years. Newsom's team polled voters to identify the most effective messengers. The results showed Obama was the most popular political figure among California Democrats and independents by a wide margin.\n\nIn early August, Newsom and Obama spoke on the phone for more than an hour, according to Holder and three other people familiar with the call. The two had little personal history -- Newsom, now seen as a likely 2028 presidential candidate, served as San Francisco mayor and lieutenant governor during Obama's presidency -- but Newsom viewed Obama's support as critical.\n\nThey strategized on how to shepherd the measure through the legislature and communicate it to the public. Newsom and Pelosi thought Obama would have unmatched impact. Obama made clear he intended to back the plan but was waiting for the right moment.\n\nObama's eventual endorsement and ad, said a person close to Newsom, was considered \"a huge step in their relationship.\"\n\nBy mid-August, Obama began lending his voice to the redistricting fight to ensure it received national attention. When Texas Democrats left the state for two weeks to temporarily block a GOP vote on the new map -- prompting threats from Republicans, civil arrest and removal from office -- Obama called in to one of their meetings at a secret location in Illinois to commend their stance.\n\nHe knew the Democratic legislators would have to return to Texas and that Republicans would ultimately pass the map. But he later released a portion of the call to make sure their protest \"would make an imprint on the national conversation,\" according to a person familiar with Obama's thinking.\n\n\"I want all of you to be returning feeling invigorated and know that you have helped to lead what is going to be a long struggle,\" Obama told the lawmakers during a virtual meeting.\n\nFive days later, at a Martha's Vineyard fundraiser for the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, Obama publicly threw his weight behind the California proposal.\n\n\"I want to see as a long-term goal that we do not have political gerrymandering in America. That would be my preference,\" Obama said. \"But I want to be very clear: Given that Texas is taking direction from a partisan White House ... I have tremendous respect for how Governor Newsom has approached this.\"\n\nAlmost overnight, Democrats across the country lined up behind Newsom's plan. Within days, the Democratic-dominated California legislature voted to place the new map on the ballot.\n\nTwo weeks ago, Obama filmed an ad aimed at motivating Democrats and independents to back Prop 50.\n\n\"California, the whole nation is counting on you. Democracy is on the ballot November 4th,\" Obama says in the ad, as a video shows a shadow of Trump and images of the National Guard and Immigration and Customs Enforcement in U.S. cities. \"Republicans want to steal enough seats in Congress to rig the next election and wield unchecked power for two more years. With Prop 50, you can stop Republicans in their tracks.\"\n\nHe sent it to Newsom's team, which added music and other edits and released it last week. The spot is now the most used across California, even as other prominent Democrats have joined the campaign, according to internal metrics obtained by The Post.", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/10/22/obama-democrats-redistricting-trump/"}

Residents and workers out downtown this week said they're puzzled and concerned by Trump's threat.\n\n\"This is a safe American city,\" Mayor Daniel Lurie told The Associated Press last week. \"We got this in San Francisco.\"\n\nThe Republican president has referenced crime as his justification for possibly sending troops to the city of roughly 830,000. He's deployed the Guard over crime concerns to Washington, D.C., where he has direct control of the National Guard, and Memphis, where the Republican governor supports their presence. Los Angeles was the first city where Trump deployed the Guard, arguing it was necessary to protect federal buildings and agents as protesters fought back against mass immigration arrests. He's since said they're needed in Chicago and Portland, Oregon, as well.\n\nResidents and leaders in Portland were surprised by Trump's attention when he described the city as besieged by violent protests. In reality, nightly protests were small and limited to the area outside a federal immigration building. While there were some arrests for violence, the demonstrations were far less intense than those that roiled the downtown in 2020 following the death of George Floyd.\n\nIn San Francisco, too, Trump seems to be relying on an outdated picture of a city often targeted by conservatives.\n\n\"The difference is, I think they want us in San Francisco,\" Trump said Sunday on Fox News. \"San Francisco was truly one of the great cities of the world. And then, 15 years ago, it went wrong. It went woke.\"\n\nHis comments angered and baffled Kate Freudenberger, who works in retail.\n\n\"You've been walking around the city, it's peaceful, there is no insurrection,\" she said Tuesday morning, adding that immigration authorities have not been as active in San Francisco as in other cities, \"so there's really been nothing for us to coalesce around.\"\n\nMarc Benioff, the chief executive of San Francisco-based software giant Salesforce, caused a stir when he told the New York Times earlier this month that he'd welcome Guard troops ito help quell crime ahead of his major annual business conference. He has since apologized for his remarks, saying the conference was the \"largest and safest\" in its history and the Guard is not needed.\n\nSan Francisco is still recovering from the coronavirus pandemic, which emptied its downtown and brought renewed attention to street homelessness and open drug dealing. But signs indicate a city on the upswing. Artificial intelligence startups are snapping up office space, and home rental prices are rising. San Francisco saw a 21% increase from last year in office visits, according to location analytics platform Placer.ai, and public transit ridership is at its highest levels since the pandemic.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal this week declared the city was emerging from its \"doom loop,\" an article the mayor eagerly shared on social media.\n\nSidewalks are cleaner and tent encampments have largely disappeared from view. In the Tenderloin, one of the most troubled neighborhoods, teams of city and nonprofit workers on Monday helped school children cross the street, walked around picking up trash or counseled homeless people. It was a different image than during the pandemic, when hundreds of people camped on sidewalks.\n\nStill, the Tenderloin is a problem spot for public drug use and dealing, as are the Mid-Market and Mission neighborhoods. But overall crime is down more than 26% this year compared to the same period last year, according to the San Francisco Police Department. Vehicle break-ins -- which have vexed tourists and residents alike -- are at a 22-year low, Lurie said.\n\nLurie, a centrist Democrat who has tried to avoid confrontations with Trump by ignoring many of the president's comments, said Monday he'd welcome more federal help to arrest drug dealers and disrupt drug markets. But sending in the Guard wouldn't achieve that, he said.\n\n\"The National Guard does not have the authority to arrest drug dealers -- and sending them to San Francisco will do nothing to get fentanyl off the streets or make our city safer,\" Lurie said in a statement.\n\nSan Francisco voters in 2024 gave police the authority to use drones, surveillance cameras and other technology to fight crime. They also ousted politically progressive District Attorney Chesa Boudin in a 2022 recall election and installed Brooke Jenkins, considered to be much tougher on crime than her predecessor. Lurie has pushed to hire and retain police officers, and entry-level police applications are up 40% over last year.\n\nMeanwhile, Gov. Gavin Newsom's administration has said it would push back forcefully on any deployment, as it did when Trump first ordered the California National Guard into Los Angeles against Newsom's wishes. California Attorney General Rob Bonta vowed to \"be in court within hours, if not minutes\" if there is a federal deployment.\n\nLawsuits by Democratic officials in Chicago and Portland have so far blocked troops from going out on city streets.\n\nLibby Baxter, a retired nurse, said Trump has sent the National Guard to Democratic cities to create \"chaos and unrest\" and she fears the same could happen in San Francisco.\n\n\"I believe that that may happen if they come to San Francisco because we are a very tolerant community, but we don't do well with somebody coming in and trying to dictate or take over certain parts of our city,\" she said.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/san-francisco-leaders-push-back-trumps-national-guard-126736180"}

Gavin Newsom's challenge to the deployment of troops in Los Angeles. Guard troops could also soon be on the ground in Portland, Oregon, pending legal developments there.\n\nHere are some things to know about legal efforts to block, or deploy, National Guard troops in various cities.\n\nA federal judge in Chicago already blocked deployment of National Guard troops to the Chicago area for two weeks. On Wednesday, she'll hold a hearing to consider whether to extend that order -- but anything she does could be moot if the U.S. Supreme Court rules in the meantime.\n\nAttorneys representing the Trump administration said in court filings Tuesday that they would agree to possibly extend the block on deployment of troops for 30 days. However, they are also continuing to ask the U.S. Supreme Court to intervene. The Trump administration is pressing for an emergency order from the U.S. Supreme Court that would allow Guard troops to be deployed.\n\n\"Every day this improper TRO remains in effect imposes grievous and irreparable harm on the Executive,\" Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in a Supreme Court filing Tuesday.\n\nLawyers representing Chicago and Illinois have asked that the Supreme Court continue to block the deployment to the Chicago area, calling it a \"dramatic step.\"\n\nAn appeals court said Monday that Trump could take command of 200 Oregon National Guard troops, but for now a separate court order blocks him from actually deploying them.\n\nU.S. District Judge Karin Immergut, a Trump appointee, issued two temporary restraining orders early this month. One prohibited Trump from calling up the Oregon troops so he could send them to Portland. The other prohibited him from sending any National Guard members to Oregon at all, after he tried to evade the first order by deploying California troops instead.\n\nThe Justice Department appealed the first order, and in a 2-1 ruling Monday, a panel from the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals sided with the administration.\n\nHowever, Immergut's second order remains in effect, so no troops may immediately be deployed.\n\nThe case is still before the courts.\n\nA panel of judges with the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Pasadena is set to hear arguments Wednesday related to Trump's deployment of National Guard troops to Los Angeles.\n\nA district court found the Trump administration violated federal law when he sent the troops to Los Angeles in early June after protests to his immigration crackdown.\n\nJudge Charles Breyer handed Newsom an early victory in the case on June 13 when he ordered control of National Guard troops back to California. But in an emergency ruling, an appeals court panel sided with the Trump administration, allowing the troops to remain in federal hands as the lawsuit unfolds.\n\nThe appeals court will weigh whether to vacate Breyer's June order.\n\nThe same three-judge panel is also handling the Trump administration's appeal to a Sept. 2 ruling by Breyer who found the president violated the Posse Comitatus Act, an 1878 law that prohibits military enforcement of domestic laws.\n\nIn Charleston, West Virginia, a state court hearing is set for Friday in a lawsuit filed by two groups who want to block the deployment of the state National Guard to Washington, D.C. More than 300 Guard members have been in the nation's capital supporting Trump's initiative since late August.\n\nIn Tennessee, Democratic elected officials sued last Friday to try to stop the ongoing Guard deployment in Memphis. They said Republican Gov. Bill Lee, acting on a request from Trump, violated the state constitution, which says the Guard can be called up during \"rebellion or invasion\" but only with the blessing of state lawmakers.\n\nSince their arrival on Oct. 10, troops have been patrolling areas of downtown Memphis, including near the iconic Pyramid, wearing fatigues and protective vests that say \"military police,\" with guns in holsters. Officials have said Guard members have no arrest power.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Gene Johnson in Seattle, Mark Sherman in Washington, D.C., Olga R.

Gavin Newsom is blaming the Trump administration and Republican lawmakers for what his office announced will soon be disruptions to millions of Californians' CalFresh food benefits, known federally as SNAP.\n\n\"Trump's failure to open the federal government is now endangering people's lives and making basic needs like food more expensive -- just as the holidays arrive,\" Newsom said in a statement.\n\nNewsom said that more than five million Californians who utilize CalFresh's food assistance could see no money loaded onto their benefit cards in November if the government does not reopen by Thursday.\n\nLocal agencies and food banks are bracing for a potential increase in need due to the delays in food assistance.\n\n\"We are preparing for thousands of additional households coming into our services,\" said Genevieve Pyeatt, director of programs for the Yolo Food Bank.\n\nPyeatt told CBS Sacramento that the Yolo Food Band and the Yolo County Health and Human Services office have teamed up to be proactive, planning right now to host emergency food distributions at CalFresh offices in Davis, Woodland and West Sacramento starting the first week of November to help families if the government does not open back up.\n\n\"Our mission is to provide food to those that are food insecure and to our neighbors. So we take it very seriously,\" Pyeatt said.\n\nPyeatt said the food bank has kept a close eye on the ongoing government shutdown and is preparing for an increase in need for their assistance. They are working to be ready to answer the call of community members, but it comes at a tough time for the agency.\n\n\"We experienced a huge loss in federal cuts already as a food bank, and so we had to adapt to that,\" Pyeatt said. \"Unfortunately, with less food resources, less funds, but still the need increasing, we're always kind of battling with this balance.\"\n\nYolo is one of the most food-insecure counties in California. Pyeatt said the local need is up about 20% over the past three years, and they serve around 30,000 households each month.\n\n\"Thanks to Donald Trump and his MAGA lapdogs in Congress, the government shutdown is going to deprive millions of Californians in need of their November food benefits,\" Newsom wrote on X. \"It is long past time for the GOP to grow a spine, stand up to Trump, and stop endangering people's lives.\"\n\nPresident Trump pushed back on the implication that Republicans are to be blamed for the government shutdown on Tuesday at the White House.\n\n\"From the beginning, our message has been very simple. We will not be extorted on this crazy plot of theirs,\" Mr. Trump said.\n\nRepublican lawmakers like Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R) also point the finger at the other party.\n\n\"We are going to keep voting to open the government and eventually, the Democrats, hopefully sooner or later, will come around,\" said Sen. Thune.\n\nMeanwhile, some California seniors living on a fixed income, like Shari Horne, feel caught off guard with their CalFresh payments in jeopardy.\n\nHorne receives a few hundred dollars a month on her CalFresh card. She cares for her husband with disabilities.\n\n\"We're very concerned. There's a lot of people here that depend on that,\" Horne said. \"It's very challenging. I hadn't thought about what we would do because I didn't know this was going to happen.\"\n\nThe Yolo Food Bank is working to add those emergency food distribution events to their calendar, with dates and times still to be determined.\n\nThe hope is that in the days to come, they will not be needed if the government reopens.\n\nFind food resources near you on their website.

(Evan Agostini/Invision/AP)\n\nSAN FRANCISCO -- The tech industry is spending billions of dollars in a drive to upgrade today's artificial intelligence tools into so-called superintelligence, a fuzzy term used by companies like Meta and OpenAI to invoke future software they hope will outperform humans in every way. On Wednesday, a loose coalition of Nobel laureates, policymakers, celebrities and British royalty said that work on the hypothetical technology must be halted.\n\n\"We call for a prohibition on the development of superintelligence,\" said a public statement with more than 700 signatories, including prominent AI researchers, Prince Harry, former Trump adviser Stephen K. Bannon and the Obama administration's national security adviser Susan Rice. The ban should be lifted only after \"strong public buy-in\" and scientific consensus that the technology can be made safe, the statement said, without specifying how either could be measured.\n\nMost AI experts in industry and academia do not think such technology is imminent, despite moves like Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg spending about $15 billion to launch a new \"superintelligence lab\" this summer. Tech firms and national governments are competing to speed up AI development, making any ban unlikely.\n\nBut the statement, coordinated by the nonprofit Future of Life Institute, comes at a time of renewed debate in Washington, Silicon Valley and across the nation about whether the potentially disruptive effects of existing AI technology require new regulations.\n\nHalf of Americans are more concerned about AI than they are excited about it, according to a spring survey by the Pew Research Center. A Gallup poll from around the same time found that 80 percent of Americans supported rules for AI even if they slowed down its technological development.\n\nThe Trump administration has aligned itself with tech figures who favor minimal regulation, rolling back AI rules introduced by President Joe Biden and supporting a proposed federal moratorium on state AI regulation.\n\nBut federal and state lawmakers have launched dozens of efforts to regulate AI technology. More than half of U.S. states have passed AI-related laws, creating a patchwork of regulations across the country.\n\nIn response, Meta and venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz in recent months set up political action committees to support candidates that oppose strict AI regulation.\n\n\"The state of AI regulation is rapidly evolving. As public use of AI tools surges, policymakers are digging in,\" said Katy Milner, a partner at law firm Hogan Lovells who works with technology companies. \"Congress and the states have introduced hundreds of AI-related bills on issues such as data privacy and government use, with a few already enacted and many more bills likely to follow.\"\n\nFew of those bills are likely to focus on the kind of speculative AI technology targeted in Wednesday's statement released by the Future of Life Institute.\n\nThe nonprofit organized an open letter in 2023 in which some business leaders and AI researchers called for a six-month \"pause\" on the training of more capable AI, but that did not appear to slow down the tech industry.\n\n\"Many people want powerful AI tools for science, medicine, productivity and other benefits. But the path AI corporations are taking, of racing toward smarter-than-human AI that is designed to replace people, is wildly out of step with what the public wants,\" said Anthony Aguirre, co-founder and executive director of the Future of Life Institute.\n\nWednesday's statement was also signed by actor Joseph Gordon-Levitt and several Nobel laureates in physics, including Geoffrey Hinton, an AI researcher widely seen as laying the groundwork for today's AI tools. Hinton left Google in 2023 to speak more freely about his concerns about AI technology.\n\nStates like California have focused on regulations on potential harms of AI tools in daily use such as chatbots or requiring more transparency from companies developing AI.\n\nIn September, California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) signed a law that requires AI companies to publish safety reports detailing potential \"catastrophic risks\" of their technology -- such as enabling hackers to break encryption software or terrorists to make new bioweapons.\n\nThis month, Newsom signed the nation's first law regulating how AI chatbots can interact with minors, after three U.S. families alleged in separate lawsuits that an AI chatbot had contributed to a teen's death by suicide.\n\nIn Washington, some Republican politicians continue to fight against AI regulation at both the federal and state level. Proponents of unfettered AI development nearly passed a 10-year moratorium on most state-level AI laws as part of Republicans' sweeping tax and immigration bill earlier this year.\n\nIt ultimately failed in the Senate after opponents of the measure including labor and children's safety advocates joined state lawmakers and attorneys general from both major parties in criticizing the moratorium. They alleged it was an infringement on states' rights and a giveaway to Big Tech.\n\nIn a bid to resurrect the idea of a federal shield for AI firms, President Donald Trump in July released an \"AI Action Plan\" that called for blocking certain federal funding from states that pass AI laws deemed \"burdensome.\" Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) has introduced a bill that would allow AI companies to apply for two-year exemptions from external regulations.", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/10/22/superintelligence-ban-statement-celebrities/"}

He's previously reported for local outlets like the Argonaut and Pasadena Weekly. Matt typically covers breaking news and crime.\n\nThe Los Angeles City Council approved a reward program on Tuesday aimed at curbing precious metal theft.\n\nIf signed by Mayor Karen Bass, the ordinance will allow the city to offer a $5,000 reward for information in felony grand theft cases and a $1,000 reward for information in misdemeanor theft investigations.\n\nIn addition to light fixtures and copper wires, the ordinance will provide a reward for information on the theft off city plaques, tombstones, statues and metals linked to the Sixth Street Bridge.\n\nThe Sixth Street Bridge in downtown Los Angeles, originally called the \"Ribbon of Light,\" is a glaring example, as it sits in darkness with seven miles of copper wire stolen and stripped from the 2023-built bridge.\n\nWhile the stolen copper is valued at $11,000, repairs to rewire it for lighting are estimated to cost over $2.5 million - and have yet to be completed.\n\nCBS News California Investigates obtained and analyzed city data and found that there have been more than 37,000 streetlight repair requests made so far in 2025. As of September, more than half are still waiting for service.\n\nThe Bureau of Street Lighting said through an email statement that 15% of the system is affected by outages. The Bureau says nearly half of its service requests are due to wire theft, and the other half are routine maintenance. This leads to a nine to 12-month period before repairs can be made, as there are fewer than 200 field staff to cover the city's quarter of a million streetlights.\n\nA report from the City Attorney's Office stated that the Los Angeles Police Department supported the ordinance, believing that it would help investigators locate suspects.\n\nCouncilman Hugo Soto-Martinez, one of the two council members who voted against the ordinance, previously argued that a lack of regular maintenance caused the outages.\n\n\"In fact, it's just regular maintenance that the city has neglected to do over the years. This should come as no surprise because we haven't assessed our street lighting funds since 1996. We've had to eliminate vacancies and so forth,\" Soto-Martinez previously said.\n\nAs an alternative, Soto-Martinez urged his colleagues to provide the Bureau of Street Lighting with more funding and personnel.\n\nAt the state level, Gov. Gavin Newsom signed Assembly Bill 476, which places greater responsibility on junk dealers when purchasing scrap metal, leaving thieves with fewer options for selling.\n\nBuyers will be required to verify the seller's identity and lawful ownership. Certain scrap metal from streetlights and traffic signals will be illegal to possess, and the bill also increases penalties for recyclers who purchase materials belonging to public entities without ensuring the seller has proper authorization.", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/losangeles/news/la-city-metal-and-wire-theft-reward-program/"}

Gavin Newsom's threat to retaliate against Texas' redistricting, state senators on Tuesday approved their fifth redrawn map in six years.\n\nIt is the latest victory in President Trump's push to level the electoral playing field, where Democrats also carved out advantages in blue states.\n\nThus far, GOP-run Texas, Missouri and Ohio have passed redrawn maps, and some 15 additional states, both red and blue, are considering revisions to those passed after the 2020 Census.\n\n\"President Trump has called on Republican-controlled states across the country to redraw congressional districts,\" said state Sen. Ralph Hise, North Carolina Republican, who championed the new redistricting effort. \"This map answers that call.\"\n\nMr. Trump praised North Carolina's legislative initiative in a recent post on Truth Social, saying that he was \"watching, and strongly supporting, very closely.\"\n\nIn North Carolina, the seat currently held by Democrat Rep. Don Davis swung blue by just 1.8% in the last election. The new map is expected to give Republicans an 11-point advantage in that district.\n\nThree other Democrat-occupied seats in the 14-seat congressional delegation are projected to remain solid blue.\n\n\"Clearly, this new congressional map is beyond the pale,\" Mr. Davis said on social media.\n\nOther state Democrats said the redistricting was racially motivated.\n\n\"This proposed map was drawn almost entirely as an attack on Black North Carolinians and it's an attempt to remove Black representation from eastern North Carolina because they can't win in a fair fight,\" said former U.S. Rep. Wiley Nickel. \"Democrats will aggressively defend Don Davis and continue the fight for Fair Maps in federal and state courts.\"\n\nRepublican lawmakers, who hold strong majorities in both chambers of the General Assembly, said the change was long overdue.\n\nState Sen. Phil Berger, the Republican president pro tempore, pointed to the long and contentious redistricting fight with Democrats.\n\n\"We have drawn four Congressional maps in the last six years in redistricting fights with Democrats because of their sue-until-blue strategy,\" Mr. Berger said last month on X. \"If we have to draw one more map this year, we will.\"\n\nIn recent years, the Tarheel State has been ground zero for legal battles related to redistricting.\n\nIn 2019's Rucho v. Common Cause, the U.S. Supreme Court effectively punted the question of partisan gerrymandering back to the state at a time when North Carolina's high court had a slight liberal advantage.\n\nA separate SCOTUS case, 2017's Cooper v. Harris, also sided against the state's GOP legislators, forcing them to redraw maps after allegations of race-based gerrymandering.\n\nHowever, the court may soon reverse course on racial gerrymandering. Democrats fear an unfavorable outcome in the recently heard case Louisiana vs. Callais could yield a net loss of 19 congressional seats nationwide, giving the GOP a near-impenetrable majority in the U.S. House.\n\nEven if the battle is waged in state courts, Democrats could have a more difficult time than in the past because there are fewer liberal justices on the state Supreme Court.\n\nGov. Josh Stein, a Democrat, also has no power to step into the redistricting battle under the state constitution.", "url": "https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2025/oct/21/north-carolina-senate-approves-redrawn-district-map-likely-giving-gop/"}

He covers breaking news throughout Southern California. When he's not writing about local events, he enjoys focusing on sports and entertainment.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom signed hundreds of bills into law this year, taking action on legislation sent to his desk by state lawmakers aimed at addressing some of California's most pressing issues, such as immigration, wildfire recovery and insurance.\n\nHere's what to know about California's new laws and how they could affect you.\n\nIn September, Newsom signed several bills while visiting Los Angeles aimed at enhancing protections for residents affected by ongoing immigration enforcement operations. Among the legislation was Senate Bill 627, called the \"No Secret Police Act,\" which prohibits most local, state and federal law enforcement officers from wearing face coverings while on duty. It also calls for all officers to be identifiable by name and badge number.\n\nA pair of bills, Assembly Bill 49 and Senate Bill 98, provide protections for students amid immigration enforcement operations conducted at schools.\n\nAB 49 prohibits school officials and employees from allowing federal agents conducting immigration enforcement to enter school sites without a warrant, court order or judicial subpoena. SB 98 requires schools to notify parents, teachers, administrators and school personnel of the confirmed presence of immigration enforcement agents and activity on school campuses.\n\nNewsom signed a package of bills on Oct. 10 that he said will \"support the ongoing rebuilding and recovery efforts in Los Angeles after the devastating fires earlier this year.\"\n\nThe legislation signed by Newsom aims to protect homeowners and tenants following a disaster; provide property tax relief for survivors; help workers recover; make insurance work more efficiently for property owners and small business owners; crack down on looting and fire responder impersonation; and reduce further risk of catastrophic wildfire.\n\nThe bipartisan package will also provide additional resources for the state's response and recovery for future disasters. Signed bills include:\n\nThe sale of new Glock handguns will stop in California under Assembly Bill 1127, but the guns won't be illegal to possess or to purchase used.\n\nThe legislation was aimed at addressing the use of \"Glock switches,\" which were already banned in the state but are now easily accessible through 3-D printing. The small switches enable the guns to be modified into fully automatic weapons.\n\nAB 1127 was passed by the California Legislature on a party-line vote, with all Republican assembly members in opposition.\n\nCo-pays on insulin in California will be capped at $35 for 30-day supplies after Newsom signed Senate Bill 40.\n\nAccording to the bill, about 263,000 Californians have type 1 diabetes and rely on daily doses of insulin. Many of the 4 million Californians with type 2 diabetes also need the doses. About one in four insulin users have reported under-usage due to the high costs.\n\nCalRX, the state's program to develop and sell its own prescription medications, will be able to sell the low-cost insulin pens beginning Jan. 1, 2026.\n\nFour bills signed in October are aimed at cracking down on puppy mills and protecting dogs and cats alike.\n\nThree of the bills, AB 506, AB 519 and SB 312, implement new regulations aimed at holding pet sellers accountable by prohibiting third-party pet brokers and requiring dog importers to submit health certificates to the California Department of Food and Agriculture shortly after shipping a pet.\n\nAB 867 bans declawing cats when not medically necessary.\n\n\"Greater transparency in pet purchases will bring to light abusive practices that take advantage of pets in order to exploit hopeful pet owners,\" Newsom said in a statement.\n\nSenate Bill 19 makes it a crime to threaten daycares, schools, universities, workplaces, houses of worship or medical facilities.\n\nThe new law amends existing California law that criminalizes credible threats, clarifying that threats to those facilities are criminal even if a specific person isn't identified.\n\nSenate Bill 576 prohibits streaming services from increasing the volume of commercials above the level of a television show or movie that someone is watching.\n\nFederal law already bans broadcasters from running overly loud commercials, but streaming services were not around when the federal Commercial Advertisement Loudness Mitigation Act was passed in 2010.\n\nSenate Bill 53 targets large artificial intelligence models and implements a number of transparency, reporting and safety requirements that developers must follow in the state.\n\n\"California has proven that we can establish regulations to protect our communities while also ensuring that the growing AI industry continues to thrive,\" Newsom said in a statement after signing the first-in-the-nation bill.\n\nNewsom also signed a package of legislation aimed at protecting children online. New laws include creating protocols for AI chatbots to identify suicidal tendencies in users and requiring companies to clarify that their AI companions are not health care professionals.\n\nApp stores and operating systems must now require age verification for users on products deemed \"inappropriate\" or \"dangerous.\" Under new California law, third parties that knowingly generate or distribute \"deepfake\" pornography may now be held liable in civil court.\n\nAssembly Bill 56 requires warning labels for social media platforms in an effort to warn young users about the downsides of extended usage of those sites.\n\nAssembly Bill 656 forces social media companies to make it straightforward and simple for users to delete their accounts.\n\nAccount cancellations will also delete all personal data from the site's database.\n\nIn an effort to help address California's high housing costs, Newsom signed Senate Bill 79, which allows for more housing construction near major transit stations. Proponents of the bill say that the legislation will also help increase ridership, reduce traffic and pollution, and expand access to jobs and schools.\n\n\"For too long, California has poured billions into transit without building the housing density needed for those systems to reach their potential,\" Newsom said.\n\nAssembly Bill 1264 makes California the first state in the nation to ban ultra-processed food from public school lunches.\n\nLimits on sugars, fats and calories in food items will go into place, as well as bans on certain dyes, including Red 40.\n\n\"For too many students, the meals they receive at school are the only ones they can count on in a day, which makes the quality of that food all the more important,\" First Partner Jennifer Siebel Newsom said. \"By removing the most concerning ultra-processed foods, we're helping children stay nourished, focused, and ready to learn.\"\n\nSenate Bill 518 moves California one step closer toward issuing reparations to descendants of enslaved persons.\n\nThe law establishes the Bureau for Descendants of American Slavery, which is eligible to receive state and federal funding within the Civil Rights Department. The bill states that the bureau's Genealogy Division would then \"verify an individual's status as a descendant.\"\n\nThe law stops short of authorizing the bureau to hand out cash reparations. The state is still determining how to \"address the lasting harms of disenfranchisement, segregation, discrimination, exclusion neglect, and violence impacting both descendants and communities,\" according to the bill's text.\n\nA 19-bill package of bipartisan legislation signed by Newsom is aimed at reducing costs and protecting families by creating stronger consumer protections. The bills signed into law include:\n\nSeveral other bills signed by Newsom specifically aim to protect tenants, including:\n\nAssembly Bill 1340 allows rideshare drivers with services including Lyft and Uber to form a union and negotiate a contract while still being labeled as independent contractors.\n\nIt requires the app-based companies to negotiate with union members in good faith.\n\nProponents of Senate Bill 42 and Senate Bill 398 say the legislation is aimed at protecting California elections against interference from what Newsom called a \"sweepstakes from billionaires seeking to buy elections.\"\n\nSB 42 puts a measure on the November 2026 ballot to repeal a ban on public financing of elections, providing California cities and counties the ability to create publicly financed election programs. Proponents say that it will level the playing field for candidates and reduce the ability to \"buy elections,\" according to the governor's office. SB 398 criminalizes offering payments or valuables to incentivize voters. The crime would be punishable by imprisonment, a fine, or both.\n\nSenate Bill 27 expands the CARE Act, which provides court-ordered services and treatments for those with mental illnesses. The new guidelines force judges to consider CARE Court as a \"frontline option\" for those convicted of misdemeanors who suffer from mental illness as a way to keep them out of the criminal justice system.\n\nA legislative package intended to increase the quality of life for California women includes new regulations on products commonly used by women, such as hair and menstrual products and prenatal vitamins. The legislation signed by Newsom also aims to increase access for women to alternative birth centers.\n\n\"Women in California deserve to have access to quality health care, child care support, and safer products for everyday use,\" Newsom said. \"I'm proud to sign these bills that will continue to address the needs of Californian women and move the needle towards gender equity.\"\n\nUnder Assembly Bill 727, student ID cards at public middle schools, high schools and colleges will be required to display the phone number for The Trevor Project, which provides a 24/7 suicide and crisis hotline for LGBTQ+ youth.

Joy Taylor says her streetlights have been out for eight months, since February.\n\n\"I not only worry about cars not seeing us, but we have a lot of wildlife in this neighborhood, and there's coyotes that are coming through the area,\" Taylor said.\n\nIn Encino, five streetlights are out of commission on a single block, leaving one couple to alter their evening walks with their aging father because of it.\n\n\"Unfortunately, because of the cracks in the sidewalk, my dad's 83 years old, he can't see, and you know, myself as well, I will trip on the cracks. You just can't walk at night, you can't when it's pitch black,\" Elayne said.\n\nCBS News California Investigates obtained and analyzed city data and found that there have been more than 37,000 streetlight repair requests made so far in 2025. As of September, more than half are still waiting for service.\n\nThe Bureau of Street Lighting said through an email statement that 15% of the system is affected by outages.\n\nLA County District Attorney Nathan Hochman said that broken streetlights have life and death consequences. He noted the downtown Los Angeles shooting death of actor Johnny Wactor.\n\n\"He got killed because three individuals were trying to steal his catalytic converter. But why did they choose Johnny Wactor's car at 3 a.m. at that exact spot? Because the streetlights were out --it was dark,\" Hochman said.\n\nThe Bureau says nearly half of its service requests are due to wire theft, and the other half are routine maintenance. This leads to a nine to 12-month period before repairs can be made, as there are less than 200 field staff to cover the city's quarter of a million streetlights.\n\nLos Angeles Councilmember Nithya Raman represents the district that includes the Cahuenga Pass and she said she is constantly getting calls about broken streetlights. \"To me, it's unacceptable that it takes up to a year to fix a broken streetlight,\" Raman said.\n\nShe's calling for an update to property assessment rates, to fund streetlight maintenance as the fees haven't been adjusted since the 90s.\n\nNeighbors in the Cahuenga Pass have taken matters into their own hands by pooling money to install their own streetlights. Residents Martha Carr and Joy Taylor said they aren't waiting for the city to come to the rescue, and instead are subsidizing a city service with two motion-activated lights.\n\n\"Well, in a strange way, I felt empowered that I was able to do something myself, but I shouldn't have to,\" Carr said.\n\nMayor Karen Bass' Office responded by email, saying the city is \"embracing new and innovative technologies like solar lighting,\" moving away from copper wire. \"Mayor Bass has begun that work as hundreds of solar streetlights have been installed,\" the Mayor's Office wrote.\n\nAssembly member Mark Gonz\u00e1lez authored AB 476, stating that \"Copper wire theft is not a victim-less crime.\"\n\nThe bill puts more responsibility on junk dealers when purchasing scrap metal, leaving thieves with fewer options when selling. Buyers will be required to verify the seller's identity and lawful ownership. Certain scrap metal from streetlights and traffic signals will be illegal to possess, and the bill also increases penalties for recyclers who purchase materials that belong to public entities without ensuring the seller has proper authorization to do so.\n\n\"Every stolen wire is more than metal ripped from the ground; it's light ripped from our communities,\" Gonz\u00e1lez said.\n\nThe city is also working on a Metal and Wire Theft Reward Program, where rewards of $5,000 would be offered for information leading to felony grand theft charges and $1,000 for misdemeanor charges involving city-owned metal thefts, including copper wiring, plaques, streetlight parts and more.", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/losangeles/news/los-angeles-copper-wire-theft-recycler-penalties/"}

Vance's protective detail during his visit over the weekend to a Marine Corps base near San Diego.\n\nOn Saturday, a 155mm M-777 howitzer was fired at Camp Pendleton, about 40 miles north of San Diego, as part of a demonstration to mark the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Marine Corps.\n\nAccording to a report from the California Highway Patrol, the Marines had been scheduled to fire at least 60 rounds during the visit by Mr. Vance, a Marine Corps veteran who served in Iraq.\n\nThe artillery round was fired at 1:46 p.m. from White's Beach, about 3/4 of a mile south of Las Pulgas Road, where the California Highway Patrol vehicles parked after escorting Mr. Vance to the base.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom ordered the temporary closure of a 17-mile stretch of a highway near Camp Pendleton during the event.\n\nPassenger rail service on a line running adjacent to the freeway was also delayed.\n\nThe move prompted a brief \"Twitter War\" between Sacramento and Washington.\n\n\"Not only did nobody at the White House or the Marines ask him to do so, the Marines repeatedly said there are no public safety concerns with today's exercises,\" according to a statement on X from the White House rapid response team that referred to the governor as \"Newscum.\"\n\n\"Newscum lies and tries to make it about himself - day ending in 'Y',\" Trump administration officials said.\n\nState officials accused the Trump administration of misleading California residents about live munitions being shot over the normally busy Interstate 5.\n\n\"Then you accused the governor of overreacting when he closed a portion of the freeway to protect the public,\" Mr. Newsom's press office said. \"Now we learn that live [ordnance] detonated early, striking a vehicle on a closed portion of the highway during the event.\"\n\nThe Marine Corps is investigating the incident, which is standard practice for the U.S. military when an artillery round misfires or lands outside the planned impact area.\n\nUnlike a self-contained bullet, a howitzer round is usually comprised of multiple sections, including the powder, the primer, the shell, and a fuze. Depending on the mission, the fuze could be set to detonate on impact, when internal sensors determine the round is near the target, or at a specific moment after firing.\n\nIf a timed fuze malfunctions or is incorrectly set, it could cause an artillery round to prematurely detonate.\n\nState police said they stopped traffic along Interstate 5 shortly before the artillery barrage was scheduled to be fired. The first, and apparently the sole, round was fired at 1:46 p.m., officials said in a report obtained by The Washington Times.\n\n\"At this time, an artillery round failed to clear the roadway and detonated mid-flight near Interstate 5 southbound. After the failed round, the exercise was terminated and no additional munitions were fired,\" California Highway Patrol officials said in their report.\n\nOne of the state officers on the protective detail reported hearing what sounded like pebbles falling on his police motorcycle. Officers also found small pieces of what appeared to be shrapnel that left a small dent on the hood of a patrol car.\n\nA safety sweep of Interstate 5 southbound did not turn up any additional pieces of metal, according to the California Highway Patrol.\n\nAlthough there were no reported injuries, state law enforcement officials immediately notified the Marine Corps which canceled the remaining fire.\n\n\"This was an unusual and concerning situation. It is highly uncommon for any live-fire or explosive training activity to occur over an active freeway,\" California Highway Patrol border division chief Tony Coronado said in a statement.\n\n\"As a Marine myself, I have tremendous respect for our military partners, but my foremost responsibility is ensuring the safety of the people of California and the officers who protect them,\" he said.\n\nThe California Highway Patrol is recommending a review into the planning, communication, and coordination that took place on Saturday between federal, state, and local government agencies.", "url": "https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2025/oct/20/artillery-misfire-vance-visit-marine-base-prompts-accusations/"}

Anyone who believes Saturday's \"No Kings\" (was that poll tested?) demonstrations across the country were not organized and largely paid for by left-wing groups hasn't been paying attention.\n\nThe New York Times claims there is \"no evidence\" that the event was subsidized by billionaire George Soros and other far-left people and organizations. That's because the underwriting isn't given directly but is filtered, like the Mafia used to launder money, through groups that wipe clean the donor's fingerprints.\n\nAt the New York City event, chants were heard comparing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers to the Ku Klux Klan. No, the Klan violated the civil rights of Black Americans, lynched some and made a mockery of the law. ICE is upholding laws enacted by Democratic and Republican congresses. It is apprehending known criminals and deporting undocumented aliens, those with prior convictions and drug dealers. What other laws do these protesters think can be violated with impunity?\n\nBack in the day when I was a reporter, I witnessed demonstrations for civil rights and against the Vietnam War. This was before social media and instant communications. These gatherings appeared spontaneous and heartfelt, though some conservatives claimed the anti-war demonstrations were supported by communists.\n\nSaturday's nationwide demonstrations appear to me to have been choreographed. As with other left-wing-inspired demonstrations on college campuses and elsewhere, I'm not buying the claim these were spontaneous uprisings that can be compared to the Boston Tea Party. That was the analogy used by Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Massachusetts Democrat. On the rare occasions when a reporter actually interviews a protester, it is clear the person is simply repeating what they have been told to say, heard from liberal professors or read on social media.\n\nThe left's hatred of President Trump has gone to the DEFCON 2 level. These protesters won't debate policies. Instead, they are full of anger. Yet anger is not policy. Anger and hate are irrational fulminations.\n\nOne can criticize Mr. Trump for many things, but his policies are mostly working. These include a closed border, a peace deal for the Gaza Strip (however tenuous that might appear) and destroying Venezuelan boats that the administration says were carrying drugs bound for the U.S. Are the protesters OK with the hundreds of thousands of Americans dying from fentanyl? According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, provisional data indicates that in 2024 alone, 48,422 Americans died from overdoses involving synthetic opioids, primarily illicitly manufactured fentanyl.\n\nIn a delicious irony, Turning Point USA contributor Savanah Hernandez shared video from the \"No Kings\" protest in New York City. It showed many demonstrators marching with signs labeling popular Democrats such as California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez \"ANTIFA.\"\n\nIf you paid attention to the language used by some Democrats who spoke to the protesters, it was mostly a rerun of that party's grievances, including the tired claim that the Trump tax cuts benefit only \"the rich\" and that the president is a \"dictator.\"\n\nAs more young people appear to be registering Republican in the aftermath of Charlie Kirk's assassination, Democrats increasingly appear flummoxed by Mr. Trump and his supporters.\n\nThe satirical Babylon Bee wrote this about the demonstrators: \"Millions of Americans took to the streets in order to express to the world their total and absolute ignorance about the political system they live in.\"\n\nI couldn't have said it better.", "url": "https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2025/oct/20/no-kings-demonstrations-expose-lefts-ignorance-hypocrisy/"}

Wes Moore, who seems to be obsessed with becoming a Gavin Newsom wannabe. Whether it's reckless spending, high crime or high taxes, Mr. Moore is trying his heart out to keep up with the disastrous governor of California in the 2028 radical Democrat George Soros presidential primary.\n\nMr. Newsom's hysteria over congressional redistricting is also living rent-free in Mr. Moore's head. In a speech last month, Mr. Moore said, \"I want to be very clear and say it loud enough for the people in the back: While these other states are determining whether or not they have fair maps ... so will Maryland.\"\n\nIt's clear that Mr. Moore's position on redistricting is driven by a strong case of TDS because he is charging straight into an unforced political error. The governor is half-right: Maryland's congressional map is unfair, but it's horribly unfair to Republicans, not Democrats. As recently as 2002, Maryland's congressional representation in Congress was split down the middle with four Democrats and four Republicans. Today, because of outrageous Democratic gerrymandering, the Old Line State's delegation in the U.S. House is now composed of seven left-wing Democrats and only one Republican in the form of conservative stalwart Rep. Andy Harris.\n\nIf Mr. Moore considered the fact that Maryland has had a Republican governor 12 out of the past 24 years and analyzed how Republican presidential candidates have fared in the state over the past several elections, he would conclude that more than one Republican district in Congress is warranted. So, if Mr. Moore really wanted to be fair, he would support a new congressional map in Maryland that has two or even three Republican districts, not zero. Yet in the age of TDS, chances are the ultra-partisan governor is eyeing a map that would have farmers on Maryland's Eastern Shore being represented in Congress by a socialist Democrat from Baltimore. This isn't leadership. If Mr. Moore really wants to earn another term in Annapolis, he has a funny way of showing it.\n\nWho knows? Maybe Mr. Moore will come to his senses and start focusing on his 2026 reelection effort before continuing to lay the groundwork for a 2028 presidential run. According to new polling, \"11% said his top accomplishment was raising taxes or making poor budget decisions, and 10% said the governor had accomplished nothing at all.\" Fresh headlines such as \"Baltimore ranked third most dangerous U.S. city by crime index\" are only making matters worse for Wes Moore as he makes premature moves on the national level such as refusing Mr. Trump's offer of federal help to make Baltimore safe again.\n\nMr. Moore's constant miscues must be getting the attention of popular former Gov. Larry Hogan, who is eligible to run for another term in 2026 and is one of the few Republicans in Maryland capable of capitalizing on Mr. Moore's failures and prevailing in a statewide contest. Mr. Moore can be defeated only by a Republican challenger who is willing to draw a sharp contrast with the failed incumbent governor, not someone who plays by the old rules and appears in photo ops with the governor around the state. Republicans shouldn't allow themselves to be used by Mr. Moore in his desperate attempt to be seen as bipartisan.\n\nMr. Moore recently said that whoever his 2026 opponent turns out to be, \"I hope you come ready.\" On that note, one thing is for certain: The next Republican nominee for Maryland governor will undoubtedly \"come ready\" by highlighting Mr. Moore's abysmal record. Upon taking office, the governor squandered the largest surplus in state history and turned it into an enormous deficit in short order. This gaffe forced him to enact record tax and fee increases earlier this year that are making Maryland a completely unaffordable place to raise a family. Add the skyrocketing energy prices that Mr. Moore's radical climate policies have caused, and you see why people are moving out of Maryland.\n\nUnfortunately for Mr. Moore, it doesn't end there. Who could forget that while Mr. Trump was busy bringing back law and order to the District of Columbia, Mr. Moore was caught on George Clooney's yacht in Italy as crime continued to ravage residents of Baltimore? With regard to the ongoing government shutdown, Mr. Moore doesn't have the guts to tell Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer, a fellow Democrat, to stop the political games and reopen the government so thousands of federal workers who live in Maryland can get back on the job and support their families.\n\nThe American people know that Trump derangement syndrome and effective leadership don't mix. Mr. Moore is about to find out the hard way that being the next garden variety Trump-hating leftist isn't enough to obscure his dreadful term in the governor's mansion or set him apart from other radical 2028 presidential aspirants.", "url": "https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2025/oct/20/wes-moores-trump-derangement-syndrome-clouds-limited-judgment/"}

Getting some help in our regional offices are shut down because of the shutdown. So we're about 97% fully operational. We got about 3%. But you have to understand, 3% for us is about 30,000 employees. So it's a larger footprint that we have. So we're very much balanced. We're very concerned about where the situation is to not go further. The further we go, the more what we'll call the outward-facing stuff will taper off with furloughed employees. But that's where we're at right now.\n\n[SWOYER] The top Democrat on the Veteran Affairs Committee, Senator Blumenthal, has recently said things like the shutdown, \"weakens veterans care.\" Specifically, he talked about cuts related to life-saving spinal cord injury. What is your response to that? Is it scare tactics?\n\n[COLLINS] Well, it's actually worse. It's a lie. And look, you can be a senator and you can be entitled to your own opinion. You just can't be entitled to your own facts. And to imply that in any way that we're cutting back on spinal cord injuries and anything else is abysmal conduct from a senator. And he ought to apologize, frankly. Especially when he's one of the ones cutting off funding to the federal government. Our spinal cord centers are open. So it's really, it's hurtful to have someone who should know, the ranking member of the committee, but yet says something that shows as if he's never heard of the VA.\n\nLook, he's done nothing but complain this whole year when we've tried to modernize our systems, how we've gotten better. We've cut our backlogs on disability claims by 100,000 almost. In less than four and a half months, we have been able to lower wait times, get better increased care, use community care. And all they're concerned about was union employees and things that are peripheral to what we do. The good senator can have his own opinion but he can't lie.\n\n[SWOYER] Is this just rhetoric related to the shutdown? You've sat through shutdowns as a member of congress. Do you think that the Democrats are going to have any sort of epiphany soon?\n\n[COLLINS] I think they will. But look, they're having to play very much to a very liberal base. The Chuck Schumer shutdown should be the AOC shutdown. It is a reaction to what happened in March. Some people get upset: \"Well, Doug, you know, you're saying the Democrat shut down.\" No, AP said Democrats shut down. The New Yorker said shutdown. So I'm just repeating what the mainstream media said. But it's true because what they've got to figure out what is it worth and the realization of what they're asking for. And they keep saying \"we don't want health care for illegals.\" I have a flyer on my desk in this office, in New York State where they put a flyer out, for 65 of undocumented workers to get health care. Medicare. That's federal.\n\nSo let's just don't play the game. The game is, is they're trying to get something. We'll see as they go forward.\n\n[SWOYER] It doesn't seem like polling really supports that. Gavin Newsom out in California actually looked at their Medicaid or what they were doing because of illegals.\n\n[COLLINS] It is, like I said, everybody's got to find their pressure point here. And it's how much was the fight? How much the fight going to be worth it? I think for them, they just got to decide, is this worth putting the country through because at the end of the day, they're going to be, they're the ones that's going to be keeping people military from getting paid. They're the one that's going to be continuing this, this painfulness of this shutdown.\n\n[SWOYER] This is before your time here, but you might remember from your years on Capitol Hill. About a decade ago, there was news about that the VA secretly had rescheduled veteran appointments.\n\n[COLLINS] I very much remember.\n\n[SWOYER] I think some of them, according to an IG report, had died waiting for their appointments and for their care, for their new appointments. I know it's been years, but are you monitoring the situation? Are there no more secret wait lists? What has been done?\n\n[COLLINS] No, in fact, that was one of the transitional moments in VA life. I was in Congress during that time. That was in 2013, 2014 timeframe. Phoenix, Augusta, Georgia, Atlanta, this is where this was coming out of. And out of that, you got the Choice Act, and that was the first step toward allowing veterans to use community care if our wait times were too long or they weren't able to get the care as quickly as they needed, which led into the Mission Act, which is under what we do now, they're working on the Access Act now. All of this is designed to get the veteran the best care quickly as possible. We've taken great steps to make sure that our veterans are getting the quality care they need. Wait times are not the best way to judge a hospital. In fact, we're the only hospital system it does. But the reason we do is because of what you just talked about. We had to find a metric in Congress to say, how do we hold them accountable?\n\nWatch the video for the full conversation.", "url": "https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2025/oct/20/watch-doug-collins-secretary-veteran-affairs-sits-alex-swoyer/"}

The stretch of freeway is typically used by over 80,000 people every day, according to the agency.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom's office said it was notified by the federal government Saturday morning that the military planned to shoot live artillery over the heavily traveled freeway, prompting highway patrol officers to temporarily close the freeway.\n\nLast week, the military said that mortar rounds would not be fired over the freeway and said no freeways or roads would be impacted by the event. Military officials said all activities would be strictly confined to training fields at Camp Pendleton and would not impact public areas.\n\nBut on Saturday morning, the federal government requested that the state change electronic highway signs to read \"LIVE WEAPONS OVER FREEWAY,\" according to the California Highway Patrol.\n\nFreeway signs all around Southern California warned drivers that live fire was in the vicinity of the freeway around Camp Pendleton.\n\nABC News has reached out to the Marine Corps, Camp Pendleton and the Trump administration for a comment.\n\nFor hours on Saturday, drivers in Southern California were stuck in gridlock on the freeway or had to take lengthy detours.\n\nDuring that time, shrapnel allegedly rained down on the freeway in the closure zone, according to CHP.\n\nIn a police report obtained by ABC News, CHP says a patrol SUV was struck with shrapnel. That SUV had \"an approximate two-inch by half-inch piece of shrapnel on the hood of the patrol vehicle,\" according to the report.\n\nThe agency says in the report that the shrapnel made a dent in the hood.\n\nAdditionally, patrol officers stated an officer working the freeway closure heard \"what sounded like 'pebbles' falling on his CHP BMW motorcycle.\"\n\nCHP says it immediately alerted the Marine Corps that a mortar round did not clear Interstate 5 and that shrapnel was falling around the freeway. At that point, the Marine Corps, according to the CHP, immediately cancelled firing additional live ordinance over the freeway.\n\nA safety sweep was conducted on the freeway to look for more shrapnel, but none was found.\n\nCamp Pendleton officials told Fox News Digital that an investigation has been initiated to determine the incident's root cause. \"The demonstration went through a rigorous safety evaluation, and deliberate layers of redundancy, to ensure the safety of fellow citizens,\" the statement to Fox reads in part.\n\nIn response to the apparent premature detonation and the firing of ordnances over the freeway, Newsom wrote on X on Sunday, \"We love our Marines and owe a debt of gratitude to Camp Pendleton, but next time, the Vice President and the White House shouldn't be so reckless with people's lives for their vanity projects.\"\n\nThe California Highway Patrol said it is requesting an after-action review with the federal government to discuss public safety.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/US/marine-corps-shrapnel-hit-patrol-car-californias-5/story?id=126670403"}

As a result, a number of new laws have just been adopted that aim to stabilize the home insurance market before and after a major catastrophe.\n\nCentral Marin Fire Battalion Chief Todd Lando said many homeowners are doing what they can to remove fuels around their homes. But that doesn't always come cheap.\n\n\"It's taken years of education and efforts to get outreach into the communities to help people understand what their real vulnerabilities are,\" said Lando. \"Especially in 'Zone Zero.' The first five feet around the house plays a big role, and sometimes, depending on what your property looks like, it could be a big expense. You may need to hire professionals.\"\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom just signed Assembly Bill 888. It establishes a grant program to help low and middle-income homeowners in high-fire risk areas to pay for the removal of flammable vegetation and install more fire-resistant roofs and materials on homes.\n\nAnother new law addresses how victims of wildfire are paid by their insurance companies. Currently, insurers of homes lost in declared disasters will only pay 30% of their policy limits for personal possessions unless homeowners supply a complete list of all that was lost.\n\n\"Rebuilding after a total loss is overwhelming,\" said Richard Otis, an attorney for a citizens' group called United Policyholders. \"People are forced to remember every toothbrush, pan, pair of shoes. It adds needless pain to an already traumatic experience. Survivors need space to heal. They need to be able to move on, not to be buried in paperwork in the past.\"\n\nSenate Bill 495 tried to stop that by requiring insurers to pay 100% of a policy's limits on personal property loss, without itemizing the possessions.\n\n\"In the process in the legislature, the insurance industry whittled that down,\" said Carmen Balber, executive director of Consumer Watchdog. \"So the bill, as it was signed by the governor last week, is 60% of that personal property coverage will be paid without an itemized list. But it still improves the situation for consumers who are being asked to itemize things in the wake of a fire and retraumatize them.\"\n\nWith many insurers drawing back from the market, many homeowners have been forced into the California FAIR Plan. It was meant to be the insurer of last resort, but has now grown to become the second-largest policy writer in the state.\n\n\"But the FAIR Plan was not designed to absorb the number of policyholders at the current rate,\" said California Assemblymember Lisa Calderon. \"This came to a head in February when the FAIR Plan requested financial assistance from its member companies to ensure claims continue to be paid from the Palisades and Eaton Fires. This measure provides the FAIR Plan additional resources to ensure they have adequate claims paying capacity.\"\n\nAB 226 helps stabilize the FAIR Plan by issuing state-backed bonds and lines of credit so insurance companies can spread out, over time, any bailouts of the FAIR Plan that may be necessary following a major disaster.\n\nFinally, SB 429 will begin the process of creating a state-wide wildfire risk model, generated by public universities, so that future pricing decisions won't rely solely on private, insurance-industry data.\n\n\"We want insurance. We need someone to provide it,\" Lando said. \"I think we need to do everything we can to make sure we can all keep it.\"", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/sanfrancisco/news/new-california-laws-aim-to-stabilize-states-wildfire-insurance-market/"}

The surrounding area was also swept by law enforcement.\n\n\"This was an unusual and concerning situation,\" said a statement from CHP Border Division Chief Tony Coronado. \"It is highly uncommon for any live-fire or explosive training activity to occur over an active freeway. As a Marine myself, I have tremendous respect for our military partners, but my foremost responsibility is ensuring the safety of the people of California and the officers who protect them.\"\n\nCHP officers filed an internal report on the incident, recommending an additional after-action review to strengthen further protocols and communication between federal, state and local government for any future demonstrations or training near public roadways.\n\nA spokesperson for the Marine Corps told CBS News that the incident was under investigation.\n\n\"We are aware of the report of a possible airborne detonation of a 155mm artillery round outside the designated impact area during the U.S. Marine Corps Amphibious Capabilities Demonstration at Camp Pendleton, CA, Oct. 18,\" said a statement from USMC, in part. \"The demonstration went through a rigorous safety evaluation, and deliberate layers of redundancy, to ensure the safety of fellow citizens.

Throughout the day, protesters filled streets in American cities, including nearby Los Angeles and San Diego, lambasting the Trump administration's domestic agenda and its consolidation of power.\n\nWhat the White House had initially planned as a celebration of the country's 250th birthday and of the might of the Marines became half of a revealing split-screen: As the likely heir of Mr. Trump's political movement showcased the power of the military over the objections of a state governor, thousands of people across the country protested a president they accused of using his power like a king.\n\nThe overlapping events amounted to a snapshot of the fractured state of American society and of the rising tensions between the federal government and Democratic leaders, who have clashed repeatedly with Mr. Trump in recent months over his use of the military in domestic affairs.\n\n\"The values Americans cherish are under assault by\" Mr. Trump, Mr. Newsom said in a social media post on Saturday. He said California would continue \"peacefully pushing back against the Trump Administration's authoritarian takeover.\"\n\nMr. Vance's aides accused Mr. Newsom of stoking fear, saying the Marine Corps had determined that the exercise at Camp Pendleton did not pose a threat. \"It's pretty shocking that Gavin Newsom knows so little about what goes on at one of the most important military installations in his state,\" said William Martin, Mr. Vance's communications director.\n\nMr. Newsom said that he simply wanted more communication about the plans. State officials said they had barely received any information about the demonstration from federal officials, and that were told earlier in the week that the demonstration would not involve firing munitions across the freeway.\n\nWhile the Trump administration argued that the exercise was routine, representatives for the Marine Corps did not answer questions about how many times it had previously fired live munitions over the California freeway.\n\nBefore the M777 howitzers fired from Red Beach at Camp Pendleton, California officials closed Interstate 5, the heavily traveled corridor between Los Angeles and San Diego, for hours. The state said it had made the decision because of potential hazards from the demonstration.\n\nThe Marines initially planned to fire multiple rounds from Red Beach east over the highway. But the exercise was eventually scaled back, effectively a compromise amid the dispute between federal and state officials.\n\nDuring his speech, Mr. Vance, who served a tour in Iraq and worked in media relations in the Marine Corps, said that the entirety of the demonstration -- the live ammunition, the parachuters descending from the sky, the Navy seals swimming ashore, the F35 jets flying overhead -- made his \"heart sing as your vice president.\"\n\nHe praised the storied history of the Marines. But as Mr. Trump has done in military addresses in recent months, he leaned eagerly into politics, casting the troops as victims of a progressive cultural agenda.\n\nHe questioned the military diversity programs the Trump administration had gutted. \"It is not our diversity that makes us stronger. It is our common purpose,\" Mr. Vance said.\n\nCriticizing Democrats, Mr. Vance pledged that the administration would ensure troops were paid during the government shutdown, after Mr. Trump directed the Defense Department to use \"all available funds\" to do so, a short-term fix that does not apply to hundreds of thousands of other federal employees.\n\n\"He wanted me to tell each and every single one of you that he's proud of you, that he loves you, and that despite the Schumer shutdown, he is going to do everything he can to make sure you get paid exactly as you deserve,\" Mr. Vance said, referring to Mr. Trump.\n\nMr. Vance, appearing to recognize the boundaries he was testing, added: \"I know we're here to talk about the Marine Corps. But I have got to get just a little political. Because congressional Democrats seem to want to keep the government shut down even though it would mean that a lot of you would not get your paycheck.\"\n\nDavid Nelson, a former captain and lawyer in the Marines, called Mr. Vance's speech detailing the history of the corps \"stirring,\" saying it had made him feel proud that he had joined the Marines in 1965. But he noted that the speech was delivered close to Los Angeles, where Mr. Trump had deployed hundreds of Marines earlier this year following protests over immigration raids.\n\n\"Since the primary purpose of the Marine Corps is to protect our country against foreign enemies, I do hope that Marines are not relegated to assisting with local law enforcement activities, potentially pitting U.S. Marines against Americans,\" said Mr. Nelson, who watched the speech on television.\n\nNorth of the Red Beach demonstration area of Camp Pendleton, where the sound of military helicopters smothered the noise of rolling breakers, Sara Kennedy, a longtime San Clemente resident, wondered why Mr. Vance was overseeing the military exercise when long-term pay for federal workers remained in jeopardy.\n\n\"It's frustrating that we're having to live through this type of time where it seems like peoples' lives don't matter, for a show,\" said Ms. Kennedy, 41.\n\nLarry St Marie, 77, a retired longshoreman and Vietnam War veteran who lives in San Clemente, did come out to see the military show on Saturday. He said he had noticed a decline in \"flag wavers\" as the country had become more polarized.\n\nHe found himself questioning how the country -- and the government -- had reached such a divisive state, he added.\n\n\"It's crazy why we're in this position,\" Mr. St Marie said. \"Doesn't make sense to me. It should have never got to this point.\"", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/10/19/us/trump-news"}

Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, as an acolyte of President Trump and supporter of his policies. \"Sears speaks for Trump,\" the narrator warns in one recent ad.\n\nAnd in California, a blizzard of TV ads has urged voters to fight against Mr. Trump -- by backing a ballot measure to redraw the state's congressional lines. \"We can stop Trump cold,\" Gavin Newsom, the state's Democratic governor, says in that campaign's most-aired ad.\n\nAfter a year of soul-searching and introspection by Democrats about what they should stand for after losing the White House and Senate in 2024, the party is largely coalescing behind the same message that has united it for the past decade: stopping Donald J. Trump.\n\nFrom coast to coast, the tactical decision to continue centering Mr. Trump in advertising in the closing stretch of 2025 contests has left some party strategists concerned about a missed opportunity to forge a more forward-looking vision.\n\n\"I worry that Donald Trump is like crack cocaine for our party,\" said Celinda Lake, a veteran Democratic pollster.\n\nMs. Lake acknowledged that running against an unpopular president could prove smart politics in the short term, revving up the Democratic base in states he lost last year, such as California, New Jersey and Virginia. But she warned it was urgent for Democrats to begin rebuilding their own beleaguered brand. The party's standing notably has not improved in polls, even as Mr. Trump's own image has sunk.\n\n\"Trump is very seductive because when you put up an ad that's anti-Trump, you get a lot of small-dollar contributions, you get a lot of activists saying, 'Great job!'\" Ms. Lake said. \"The biggest thing the Democrats need to do is not the negative but the positive. We have to offer an alternative.\"\n\nMs. Spanberger and the Democratic nominee for governor in New Jersey, Representative Mikie Sherrill, have run positive ads about their own agendas and accomplishments. Ms. Sherrill's service as a Navy helicopter pilot, in particular, has been spliced into numerous spots. And supporters have made the case that victories by these two moderate women with national security credentials would help reset the party's image.\n\nBut the airwaves have been cluttered with Trump-related attacks, according to a New York Times review of the television ads this year compiled by the ad-tracking service AdImpact. Ms. Sherrill linked Mr. Ciattarelli and Mr. Trump in an ad as early as the spring, even before she had won the Democratic primary. Ms. Spanberger's campaign has spent more than $6 million on ads linking Ms. Earle-Sears and Mr. Trump, records show, even though Mr. Trump has not technically endorsed Ms. Earle-Sears.\n\nBrad Todd, a veteran Republican admaker and political strategist, mocked Democrats for using Mr. Trump -- over and over -- to rile up their liberal base.\n\n\"If I were running a Democratic campaign, I would be attempting to broaden my coalition beyond a visceral hatred of Trump,\" Mr. Todd said.\n\n\"To get a mandate to govern,\" he added, \"you have to win over voters in the conflicted middle.\"\n\nThe 2025 elections are playing out in mostly more favorable terrain for Democrats. In the 2024 presidential race, Mr. Trump lost both states with governor's races this year, and he was routed badly in California.\n\nYet Democratic strategists know that red states and districts will be crucial to the party's chances in the 2026 midterm elections, in terms of both winning a House majority and trying to flip the Senate, which would require winning in at least three states Mr. Trump carried in 2024.\n\n\"I don't think anti-Trump will be a sufficient message in the 2026 midterm and the 2028 general to mobilize and persuade the kind of voters who have been eroding from the Democratic Party,\" said Terrance Woodbury, a Democratic pollster who specializes in studying younger voters and minority groups. At the same time, Mr. Woodbury, who is involved in the California redistricting ballot campaign, said his own research showed that Mr. Trump was the biggest motivator for voters right now.\n\n\"As long as Trump is on the political stage, he can't not be part of the political conversation,\" he said. \"He can't be the entire political conversation.\"\n\nIn Virginia, Spanberger campaign ads have highlighted Ms. Earle-Sears's support for Mr. Trump's signature budget legislation, and her refusal to criticize federal work force layoffs in a television interview. \"It's a real issue that Sears supports Trump, not Virginians,\" one of the ads says.\n\nAn exasperated Ms. Earle-Sears interrupted Ms. Spanberger's closing statement at a recent debate to declare, \"If I were taking a drink for every 'Trump' that she said, I tell you we would be drunk by now.\"\n\nTaNisha Cameron, a spokeswoman for Ms. Spanberger, said in a statement that \"every day through Election Day, we will remind voters of the contrast in this race.\"\n\nIn New Jersey, a group called Greater Garden State linked to the Democratic Governors Association has spent more than $2 million on an ad showing a photo of Mr. Ciattarelli and Mr. Trump together and calling him \"100% MAGA.\"\n\nThe Trump-themed ads have been so omnipresent -- including some in Spanish -- that the Ciattarelli campaign felt compelled to respond in its own ads.\n\n\"New Jersey's a mess, and all Mikie Sherrill wants to talk about is President Trump,\" Mr. Ciattarelli complained in one spot. \"Come on. What does the president have to do with rising property taxes and higher electricity bills?\"\n\nThere could be more to come. Mr. Ciattarelli gave Mr. Trump an \"A\" grade at a recent debate, and the Sherrill campaign has hit him for not breaking with the president on his decision to withhold funds for the Gateway tunnel project connecting New Jersey and Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan.\n\n\"While Mikie Sherrill has focused her entire campaign on how much she hates Donald Trump, people here in New Jersey are focused on who can fix the state and only one candidate is talking about that,\" said Chris Russell, an adviser to Mr. Ciattarelli.\n\nIn one of the other high-profile races of 2025, for New York City mayor, the Democratic nominee, Zohran Mamdani, has drawn attention for his success in making his campaign about an ambitious agenda of free buses, universal child care and a rent freeze. He has also swiped at Andrew M. Cuomo, the former governor who is running as an independent in the general election, by linking him to Mr. Trump for the president's efforts to meddle in the race.\n\nIn California, Mr. Trump is at the center of Mr. Newsom's bid to redraw the state's congressional maps and counter the partisan gerrymander in Texas pushed through at the president's behest. Mr. Newsom has recorded multiple ads about the president's role and the campaign has recruited surrogates including Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York to warn about Mr. Trump.\n\nMeanwhile, Tom Steyer, the Democratic financier who once bankrolled a campaign to impeach Mr. Trump before his own failed presidential campaign, is spending money to run anti-Trump ads.\n\nHe announced a $12 million campaign in favor of Proposition 50, the redistricting measure, that imagines an angry Mr. Trump throwing fast food after the measure passes in November. The ad's tagline is straightforward: \"Stick it to Trump.\"\n\nThe anti-Trump theme has trickled down the ballot, too.\n\nIn at least two races for Virginia's House of Delegates, Democratic candidates have run ads linking Republican rivals to Mr. Trump. And in the race for Virginia attorney general, Jay Jones, the embattled Democratic nominee, has made linking the Republican incumbent, Jason Miyares, to Mr. Trump a centerpiece of his advertising. Mr. Jones's campaign has threatened to come undone after the revelation of private text messages discussing the hypothetical killing of a Republican lawmaker.\n\n\"When it comes to standing up to Trump, Jason Miyares is too weak,\" the narrator says in one Jones ad. The Miyares campaign has countered by accusing Mr. Jones of being weak on crime.\n\nGeoff Garin, a Democratic pollster, said that ignoring an unpopular president who motivates voters would make no sense for the party.\n\n\"A lot of Democratic voters look at Trump as an emergency and an emergency happening in real time,\" Mr. Garin said. \"Regardless of how they feel about anything else, standing up to Trump is a really important motivator for them.\" In that way, Mr. Garin called the 2025 races \"a precursor to what will be very much a checks-and-balances election in 2026.\"\n\nBut Chris LaCivita, who served as a top strategist for Mr. Trump's 2024 campaign, said Democrats were stuck running a \"one-dimensional strategy.\"\n\n\"It's all anti-President Trump -- that's all they can speak to,\" Mr. LaCivita said. \"They have literally nothing to run on that helps the American people and the middle class.\"", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/19/us/politics/democratic-campaign-ads-trump.html"}

(Credit: POOL)\n\nVice President JD Vance joined Marines and sailors at Camp Pendleton in California on Saturday for the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Marine Corps, telling the crowd that the Corps remains ready to fight and ready to win.\n\nThe anniversary event included an amphibious assault demonstration on Red Beach, speeches from military leaders and cabinet officials, and a reminder from Vance that he is the first Marine to serve as vice president.\n\nHelicopters roared overhead and amphibious vehicles surged through the surf as Marines charged the beach to open the ceremony. Second Lady Usha Vance accompanied her husband to watch the display while families shaded their eyes and Ospreys thundered overhead.\n\nThis year's ceremony marked a quarter millennium since the Continental Congress first authorized the Marine Corps in 1775.\n\nNEWSOM CLASHES WITH WHITE HOUSE OVER MARINE CORPS ANNIVERSARY CELEBRATION HIGHWAY CLOSURE\n\nGeneral Eric Smith, Commandant of the Marine Corps, told the crowd that what they were seeing was the sound and look of freedom. He described the Corps as America's \"911 force\" and warned that Marines must be ready for whatever comes next.\n\n\"The next fight is coming,\" he said. \"Marines will be ready. Ready to fight. Ready to win.\"\n\nThe next fight is coming. Marines will be ready. Ready to fight. Ready to win.\n\n-- General Eric Smith, Commandant of the United States Marine Corps\n\n\"When it matters most, it's not technology or equipment that wins the day, but the dependability, decisiveness and character of the Marine or sailor who wields it,\" Smith said. He ended by thanking families and offering a blessing for their sacrifices.\n\nVP VANCE'S CAMP ACCUSES CALIFORNIA GOV. GAVIN NEWSOM OF DISSEMINATING 'FAKE NEWS' AHEAD OF MARINES CELEBRATION\n\nSecretary of War Pete Hegseth then delivered one of the day's most fiery addresses. A combat veteran himself, he told the Marines that the Corps stood strong when others wavered.\n\n\"I'm not supposed to say this, really not. But I think you guys might be my favorite,\" Hegseth said.\n\nHe tied the Corps to the administration's broader theme of America First, peace through strength, and common sense at every turn. Hegseth reminded the crowd that while many different faces fill the ranks, unity of mission is the true strength of the Corps.\n\n\"The truth is, your diversity is not your strength. Never has been. Your strength is in your unity of purpose. It's in your shared mission. It's in your oath to the Constitution. It's the bond that turns individuals into single-minded fighting units. You see, you are set apart. You're not civilians. You're devil dogs, leathernecks, United States Marines,\" the Secretary said, drawing cheers.\n\nThe crowd erupted when Vance took the stage.\n\n\"God bless you, Marines,\" he began, smiling as chants of \"Oorah!\" echoed back. He quickly reminded them that he's the first Marine to hold the office of vice president. \"From one Marine to another, thank you for your service,\" he said.\n\n\"I've also got to give a special shout out to the incredible display that we saw earlier today. It made my heart sing,\" Vance said. \"As your vice president, and it was a testament to the core strength and unbeatable power. It reminded me why I am so proud to have worn the uniform, to be one among your ranks, and to be the very first vice president to have been a United States Marine.\"\n\nVance used his speech to honor heroes, remember the fallen and reflect on his own service. He mentioned Medal of Honor recipient Sgt. Dakota Meyer who served in Afghanistan, Navy corpsman Charles Cram who helped raise the flag at Iwo Jima, and Navy aviator Elmer Royce Williams who survived the longest dogfight in American history.\n\nTRUMP DECLARES 'REAWAKENING' OF 'WARRIOR SPIRIT,' UNWAVERING SUPPORT FOR MILITARY: 'I HAVE YOUR BACKS'\n\nThe vice president mixed solemnity with humor that fellow Marines recognized immediately. He joked about the \"E-4 Mafia\" and shared a story about a gunnery sergeant who once saved him from signing a 22% interest used car loan by steering him to Navy Federal Credit Union.\n\n\"That gunny's leadership didn't just save me money,\" Vance said. \"It taught me that Marines look out for each other.\"\n\nVance's remarks included a particular story from boot camp. Recruits queued for Catholic or Protestant church services and Vance, referring to himself in the third person as, \"recruit,\" called himself an atheist.\n\n\"Get in the Catholic line,\" the drill instructor snapped. That punchline, Vance joked, \"wouldn't work in the Biden administration.\"\n\nVance also took aim at Democrats in Congress over the government shutdown, promising that the administration would fight to ensure enlisted Marines are paid.\n\n\"We will do everything possible to make sure enlisted Marines get paid,\" he said. \"Political battles in Washington should not come at the expense of troops and their families.\"\n\nHe tied the 250th anniversary back to the Corps' beginnings at Tun Tavern in Philadelphia in 1775. He named battles that define Marine history: from Belleau Wood and Iwo Jima to the Chosin Reservoir, Khe Sanh, Ramadi, Fallujah and Helmand, and told the audience that every generation of the Corps shares the same common purpose.\n\n\"Every single person here bleeds Marine Corps green,\" Vance said. \"It is our common purpose that carries us forward.\"\n\nEvery single person here bleeds Marine Corps green.\n\n-- Vice President JD Vance\n\nVance reminded East Coast Marines swatting sand fleas at Parris Island that their bond is the same as those climbing the hills of California. He spoke of his pride in wearing the Corps' uniform and closed with words that Marines have heard before but welcomed on their birthday.\n\n\"Keep kicking a--. Keep taking names. Semper Fidelis, Marines. Happy 250th birthday. God bless you,\" he said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe ceremony ended with the roar of the crowd as the day carried reminders of sacrifice, grit and unity.\n\nThe Department of War, Navy, and Vance's office did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

While marching through Times Square with almost two weeks until Election Day, New York City voters explained why they are voting for Mamdani for mayor.\n\n\"He represents everything they're not,\" Edgar, a New York City voter who lives in Rockaway Beach, Queens, told Fox News Digital.\n\nEdgar explained that democracy is \"under attack,\" and New York City needs a leader, like Gov. Gavin Newsom, D-Calif., to similarly fight back against the Trump administration.\n\nFINAL STRETCH: MAMDANI'S LARGE LEAD SHRINKING AS CUOMO GAINS GROUND IN NYC MAYORAL RACE\n\nMamdani himself has applauded Newsom's leadership rejecting Trump's second-term through judicial action, particularly when Trump sent the National Guard to Los Angeles during protests rejecting U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement deportations.\n\nTrump has since sent the National Guard to major cities, including Washington, D.C., Chicago, Portland, Oregon, and Memphis, Tennessee, to combat crime.\n\nHe has also threatened to cut federal funding to New York City if Mamdani is elected mayor.\n\n\"I don't think he's afraid of Trump in the least,\" Gail Kelly, a lawyer who lives in Breezy Point, Queens, who said she is voting for Mamdani, told Fox News Digital in Times Square.\n\nKelly said she is \"tired\" of former Gov.

Mamdani, honestly, I don't know if he's got good ideas. I don't think a lot of ideas are gonna work, but he's got optimism, he cares about the people in the city, he cares about people's lives. That's good enough.\"\n\nCuomo resigned as New York governor in 2021 following multiple sexual harassment allegations that he has denied. Rich Azzopardi, a Cuomo campaign spokesperson, fired back at Brad's charge when reached for comment.\n\n\"Andrew Cuomo passed a $15 minimum wage, paid family leave, made marriage equality the law of the land, made college tuition free for nearly 80 percent of CUNY students and protected a women's right to choose by codifying Row vs. Wade into state law. Whomever said that clearly doesn't know what any of that word salad means. Send me their address, I'll be happy to send them a dictionary on me,\" Azzopardi said.\n\nAnnelice Morales, a Mamdani voter who lives on Manhattan's Upper East Side, said Mamdani's transparency is refreshing.\n\n\"I just think people, like Cuomo, have been in power for a really long time, and they abuse power,\" Morales told Fox News Digital while marching in the \"No Kings\" rally.\n\nMorales said she \"100%\" hopes Mamdani will fight back against Trump.\n\n\"He has a message to improve lives, the material needs of the New Yorkers,\" Lenny, a Lower East Side resident who is voting for Mamdani in November, said on Saturday.\n\nWhen asked if he wants Mamdani to fight back against Trump, Lenny said, \"Just uphold the law. It's that simple.\"\n\nMamdani has a 21-point lead among New York City registered voters: 49% back Mamdani, while 28% go for Cuomo and 13% favor Sliwa, according to the latest Fox News poll.\n\nVoters will elect a new mayor of New York City on Nov. 4 as Mayor Eric Adams suspended his re-election campaign last month.\n\nWhile those who spoke to Fox News Digital at Saturday's \"No Kings\" rally in Manhattan said they were voting for Mamdani in the upcoming election, the democratic socialist candidate did not advertise that he was attending.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nMamdani's campaign did not respond to inquiries about whether he was attending any \"No Kings\" rallies.\n\nMeanwhile, Sen.

But the makers of the bags labeled them as recyclable even though they were not - recycling facilities cannot process them and they end up dumped in landfills, incinerated, or in the state's waterways, Bonta said.\n\n\"In California, we're making it clear,\" he said at a news conference. \"Truth matters. Public trust matters. Environmental protection matters.\"\n\nThe companies did not respond to email and phone requests for comment.\n\nThe state filed a similar lawsuit against ExxonMobil about a year ago over the oil giant's plastic products. The lawsuit said the company deceived the public by falsely promising that its plastic products would be recycled. The oil giant said California's recycling system was ineffective and that the state should have worked with the company to keep plastics out of landfills.\n\nCalifornia lawmakers later decided the 2014 law didn't go far enough. Democratic Gov.

She also recently headlined a fundraiser for North Carolina Senate candidate Roy Cooper, a former governor and Harris' longtime friend.\n\nLater this month, she plans to campaign for California's \"Yes on Prop 50,\" the ballot measure that would allow a Democratic-led redraw of the state's congressional districts to counter Republican gerrymandering in Texas and other Republican-controlled states.\n\nHarris, who was unusually blunt in her book \"107 Days\" about her opinions on a range of political figures, was more circumspect Friday when asked to assess other leading Democrats.\n\n\"We have to get away from this idea of 'Who is the one?' There are many ways that I think will be effective when people are authentic unto themselves,\" she said when asked about her fellow Californian, Gov. Gavin Newsom, and his recent social media mockery of Trump.\n\nShe named U.S. Reps. Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas, and Brittany Petterson, D-Colo., but did not elaborate. \"Every voice and every perspective\" can resonate with certain voters, she said.\n\nHarris rejected conventional political wisdom that she lost in part because of Republicans' sustained attacks on cultural and social issues, especially transgender issues. She said economics, notably inflation, was the bigger factor.\n\n\"There are a fair number of people who voted for Donald Trump because they believed what he said, which is that he was going to bring down prices,\" she told the AP. \"Sadly, he lied to them.\"\n\nWith prices still high and wealth gaps growing, Harris said, \"We've got to do a better job of dealing with the immediate needs of the American people.\"\n\nShe praised the Biden administration's legislative accomplishments but said household-level policies such as child tax credits, family leave and first-time homebuyer credits should have come before a sweeping infrastructure program and the CHIPS semiconductor manufacturing law.\n\nEven with a sharper economic message, Harris acknowledged structural challenges for Democrats: the proliferation of false information and what she described as conservatives' assault on democracy.\n\nShe rejected the idea of \"low-information voters,\" saying the problem is actually an abundance of misinformation and disinformation that makes it harder to reach many voters. She said Democrats must penetrate those silos rather than presume anyone is a lost cause.\n\n\"They deserve to be heard,\" she said.\n\nOnstage, Harris described a \"reversal\" of the Civil Rights Movement. She lamented that the Supreme Court could eliminate Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which protects political district boundaries drawn to ensure minority communities can elect candidates of their choice.\n\nWithout that law, nonwhite representation -- especially Black representation in the South -- could diminish considerably, from Congress to local school boards and municipal councils.\n\n\"How can we say at this moment in time that the Voting Rights Act and Section 2 has no purpose?\" Harris said to the AP.\n\nThe issue carried special resonance given the venue. The Voting Rights Act passed in 1965 after Martin Luther King Jr. and civil rights leaders marched from Selma, Alabama, to Montgomery. A later Supreme Court case out of Mobile led Congress to clarify its intent with Section 2 of the law. And it was a Shelby County, Alabama, case that the Supreme Court used in 2013 to gut the law's requirement that the U.S. Justice Department approve election procedures in local jurisdictions with a demonstrated history of discrimination.\n\nBesides the pending Supreme Court case, Harris said she has followed Trump's rhetoric on immigrants, along with statements from top Trump adviser Stephen Miller and other Republicans suggesting the U.S. owes its identity to white European settlers.\n\n\"Just looking at it in terms of their words, they're race baiting, they're scapegoating,\" she said. But she stopped short of saying the administration is being driven by a white nationalist ideology: \"I can't pretend to know what is in their head.\"\n\nHarris said Friday that she never doubted former President Joe Biden's ability to serve, even when he ended his reelection bid because of concerns about his age. That's different, she explained, than discussions about whether the 82-year-old could have served another term.\n\n\"He and I have been playing phone tag actually in the last couple of days,\" Harris told the AP when asked whether she still talks to Biden, who is undergoing prostate cancer treatment. \"I'd invite everyone to say a prayer if that's what you do for his well-being and health right now.\"", "url": "https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2025/oct/18/kamala-harris-says-democrats-standing-working-people-ap-interview/"}

Country fried steak. Gavin Newsom, I like it. Yeah, that's pretty much what it's going to take. Because it's just us Southerners today. I thought we could Zoom out a bit and talk about the South. I'm going to tell you y'all a story that is I'll say it this way. It's the first moment when I knew that never Trump was absolutely cooked. And that was early in 2016. There had been some glimmers of hope that Donald Trump could be stopped after the Iowa caucuses. Remember, he underperformed there. And then he comes to the South. And I can remember watching him. Here's a New Yorker, a New York real estate developer, reality TV star should not, on paper, be somebody who's going to really connect with the American South. But then I looked at him and I watched him operate and I thought oh, we're done. He's sweeping, sweeping Super Tuesday. Why? Because he was a very familiar figure. If you are somebody who's paid attention to Southern culture and politics, he immediately fit into that mold of a Huey Long, of a George Wallace of a Edwin Edwards from Louisiana. And I thought, this person is absolutely connecting at a very fundamental level with his audience, and he's kept connecting. We're all, as I said, we're all Southerners here. Let's talk about this. But before we dive into the substance of it all, let's establish our Southern street cred, so to speak. I was born in Opelika, Alabama, raised in Alabama, Louisiana, Tennessee and Kentucky. I'm coming to you from Nashville right now. Tressie, what's your Southern background? I could start by saying, well, I'm Black, but I guess that doesn't totally cover it all, so I'll be more specific. Let's see. My family is from Eastern North Carolina, Robeson County. This may be one of the rare occasions where Robeson gets a shout out in the New York Times' I'm going to say that very strongly. Robeson County is Eastern North Carolina. And we have been there for generations. I like you, David, have lived all across this country but have consistently returned to the American South. And I presently live and work in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, which is in the midst of a football induced crisis, which at this very moment, if we want to pivot, I am happy to talk about the football induced crisis here. And in fact, if you give me enough time and a long enough ramp, I can make it the story of the nation. If you allow me. Bill Belichick coming from New England to Chapel Hill, North Carolina, to save us from ourselves at the behest of the state's Republican cultural elite. If you give me time, David, I can make it work. But, yes. Oh, I didn't mean to open that can of worms, but I. Believe me, I would love to hear every second of it. But, Jamelle, what about my friend. We're going through some difficult things right now. I have not lived as much around the South as either of y'all. My family is from. My mom grew up in Waycross, Georgia, which is in Ware County, Georgia, in the Southern part of the state. My dad grew up in Quincy, Florida, which is Gadsden County, and then also Fort Myers, kind of back and forth between those two places. But I grew up in Virginia Beach, Virginia, and then went to the University of Virginia and then lived in D.C. for a minute. And now I'm in Charlottesville, Virginia. I think of myself as a southerner. Yes, but also very much like a Virginian, right. Oh shots fired. Jamelle drawing the distinctions. I'm not drawing a distinction, but I do think that I do think that for people within the South, there's people recognize the real cultural distinctions between places. I think what matters here is that we have all so far. Yeah I think what matters here is at this point, we have all said y'all appropriately. That's true. And that is everybody's credibility. So let's get into the substance here. Tressie in 2023, you wrote a column called \"Why I Keep My Eyes and Mind on the South.\" And it's all about how you can understand where American politics are headed based on what you see in the South. Why do you say that? Well, said one, I mean, I believe it deeply and truly. And at the time that I was writing that, of course, in 2023 there was some nascent hope that we were turning a page on, I think, Southern politics and its hold on national politics. We thought we had a strategy, even for Trumpism. We had survived it once. We can survive it again. And one of the things that I was trying to remind people, something that I think Jamal does particularly well here, is that, in fact, what we needed to be concerned about is that Trump had realized how much power he could derive by deeply embedding himself in the ideas of the South, the iconography of the American South. And, unfortunately, I think that is one of the things that we have learned to be true. But I think one of the things that when we say Trumpism, I'm talking about both Donald Trump and the infrastructure around him that makes him powerful and to a certain extent, effective. I think one of the things they learned is that the most efficient way to control the public's attention was to just hammer these ideas that I think are deeply, fundamentally Southern. So these are ideas about race, obviously, and these are ideas about the inherent character of the nation, about who is included and who is excluded, not just constitutionally, but whose citizenship is always conditional. These are all deeply and fundamentally Southern relationships of power. But I also would like to point out the reason why those ideas are so rich and so powerful in the South isn't just because the South is uniquely racist. It is because that's where the nation's shunts off all of those conversations. And so we tend to hold all of that energy, all those ideas, all of those histories for the rest of the country. And I think that what Donald Trump has figured out is something that national politicians have long figured out in this country is that well, never runs dry. And I thought one of the mistakes we made the first time and by we I will include myself here, although I would like to say I did not make the mistake nearly as bad as some of my professional peers did, or consistently wasn't, thinking that somehow we had moved beyond that. And that you could understand the broader political map and imaginary by looking at it from the vantage point of New York or California or the Midwest. And I just thought that one of the reasons why we missed why a message of economic populism message packaged in Trump's infotainment package, why that would work in the South. As you talk about seeing him live. I also saw him live in Richmond, Virginia. I saw him in South Carolina. I saw him outside of Atlanta, Georgia. It was never a surprise to me that he spoke to Southerners. I was surprised by how many of US professional observers weren't paying attention to how well he worked here, because I thought that was a message for how well he was going to work across the country. Yeah I want to add a note to Tressie's last point there. So one observation I'm sure everyone on in this conversation has made and other people have made is the way that there has emerged kind of almost generic national, rural culture. It's a certain kind of country music. It's a certain kind of pickup truck. You see it if you go to rural New Hampshire, if you go to rural Montana, if you go to rural Illinois, you'll see it. And it's very much rooted in a franchised version of a white Southern rural reality. And I bring that up to say that it's both the case that the country will shunt its difficult conversations, as Tressie said, about say, race to the South and make it a Southern problem. But it's always been the case that the rest of the country, has been fascinated by the South in really important ways the people who push the narratives of national reconciliation in the decades after reconstruction weren't Southerners right. It was a bunch of New Jersey academics at Princeton. Woodrow Wilson, although born in Virginia, very much a man of the mid-Atlantic, you might say. Hollywood's fascination with the South, you cannot understand. I mean, there's obviously the birth of a nation, but you can't understand the history of American film without a recognition of a real fascination with the imagery and the culture of at least a particular version of the South that pulses through westerns, that pulses through screwball comedies, TV. I mean, we all get a little Southern when this nation is going fascist is just what it is, right. We all want to consume the romantic version of the South the verandas, the Magnolia trees, the music the food to Jamelle's point. When I look out across like our popular culture even I'm always going to start paying attention when country music is ascendant. I'm always going to pay attention. When SEC football now becomes a national obsession. I'm going to pay attention when the Bama Rush girls are driving millions of dollars of free marketing for their university. Because what that does for people, again, audience that is consuming this from outside the South is we can always say, no matter how bad it is in California, no matter how bad it is in Montana, at least we're not the South. And so you consume the palatable parts of the South to make yourself feel better about where the National trend lines of politics are going. But yet we produce an idea of America that says, well, we're not as bad as the South, but also the South wasn't really always that bad, now was it. We're always doing both of those projects at the same time in the context of Donald Trump, I think it actually -- Donald Trump's usage of the South for example, his occasional references like oh, they took down the statues and that kind of thing. I mean, Donald Trump's the extent to which he connects or connected with Southern voters in 2016 and the extent to which the Southern evangelicals, become kind of his core constituency to me, reflects both things happening internal, but also this national interest in fascination with the American South. The other thing I'll say, just in terms of Trump as a familiar and recognizable figure. So, you mentioned David Huey Long, Edwin Edwards, part of Trump's political appeal. And this isn't I feel like this isn't talked about enough, is that he presents himself as this perfect avatar of a kind of patriarchal masculinity. He has all this money and he has this gilded home, and he has this big family, right. Even in even elements of him that the joke, if Obama had done that, people would gone crazy and they would have, such as his multiple wives. And, basically multiple babies mamas is in this image of patriarchal white masculinity, Southern masculinity, not an issue. That particular image of masculinity is so deeply rooted in Southern culture, going back to the very beginning. And Trump just slots right into it, no problem whatsoever. There is a time in my life when hearing you, you all talk about the South like this. I would have bristled a bit. I would have said, O.K, I'm going to fully acknowledge there are radiating still negative effects of the South's past in the South, no question, but it really has turned a page in a very decisive way. But I think for me, one of the things that has been very dispiriting about the present moment is that I don't think the South has changed as much as I thought it had changed that a lot of the elements that I thought of what we call New South, what we called the New South. I'm sure you guys remember Atlanta being called the city. Too busy to hate that. It was turning the page on racism in the past through commerce, through hatred was bad for business. And so the South was moving on. It was a commercial place. It was a place that was growing economically, growing in population. It wasn't a backwater anymore. And I grew up in that period after the Civil rights movement came of age politically, after Richard Nixon is gone and this kind of blip of a moment where the Republican Party, which was rooted in the South, very much started to identify itself around the concept of personal character in response to Bill Clinton. And to me, that was the New South, that it had left segregation behind. It had left hatred behind. It was still struggling with the legacy of all of that, but it had largely left it behind. It had left all of that populist nonsense behind. And then here comes Donald Trump and makes me rethink almost all of that. And it was as if the new right, what we call the new right now, really is truly the old right. It really is an older right than what you saw, say, in Reagan. In Reagan, republicanism and its center of revival is in the South. And what I'm curious, and either Jamelle or Tressie, this really interesting fusion, though, if you look back on it with the intense religious fervor of the South at the same time that it has this legacy of extremely corrupt political figures and this symbiotic relationship that they had that seems to have persisted into this present era, but channeled and funneled into the person of Donald Trump. Is that too much to say. Our perspective on where we are in history is just always shaped by where we enter it. And so we can have an overinflated, overinflated sense of clarity about Oh, this is the direction that we're going in. And I think things are far more cyclical than we are usually willing to admit. And one of the things that some people have struggled with in Donald Trump is the fact that he is both a departure from the way that politics were operating in the moment, but is not a departure historically. Again, when you talk about the commerce angle and how much we relied on economic nationalism to save the cultural, moral and ethical failings of the American South, that supposes that economic progress is at odds with racial regression. And what I would argue is that those things have always not just been compatible, but have been symbiotic. Symbiotic I mean, slavery is an economic system. So these two things are not at odds. It is just that in the South, they are always hyper visible in a way that other regional economies in this country cannot say. You listen, God bless Atlanta. Atlanta raised me culturally, right. I owe 30 percent of my personality to Outkast. I grew up wanting to be one of the new Black Americans in the Black elite, coming out after the Cosby Show and living my great dreams in Atlanta every good black person in the 1990s. But the idea that there was ever any truth to the idea that we were too busy building a commercial economic powerhouse for Black America for us to be bothered with, racism really flies in the face of what was happening on the ground during that time of so-called economic progress. You can look at something like, Bill Clinton's America. This is also the creation of a police surveillance system that fundamentally pins Black Americans into everything from substandard housing to being geographically isolated out of the economic progress of Atlanta. The cost of living starts to push black people out of its inner core, for example. So these things are all happening simultaneously. This is about the difference between the reality of our political life and the story we tell ourselves about our political life. And I think what Donald Trump, Trump and the G.O.P., which I now want to make, I always want to take the opportunity to say these are now 1 and the same. But what they have been able to exploit is like our constant forgetting about that, and how much we want to believe that economic progress will take care of these things. And I would just I always hearken back to somebody like a Du Bois who says these things are not antithetical to each other, economic progress and racism are deeply intertwined. Yeah in addition to the cultural and political piece, I would identify just the economic agenda of this G.O.P. as a kind of national vision of what the South has been, which is a region of extraction, weak or no rights for labor, right of surveillance, of control, of low wages, of low services, and of not just low taxes for those that already have wealth and privilege, but essentially they're kind of right to dominate the entire economic and political sphere unmolested by those they perceive to be below them. That to me, that is Trumpism, right. That is Trumpism. And I think it really I think it's important to recognize the way that this is not just a cultural thing that's happening, that what we're looking at is the influence of an economic model that has appeal to political elites across the country, as it always has, always has. The first offshoring wasn't to Mexico, wasn't to Vietnam, it was to Alabama. It was to Georgia. It still is. That's the car factories are in Tennessee because the labor protections aren't in. The Southern politicians go out to the rest of the world and say, and they say to them, our labor is easier to control than the labor is in California. Our labor pool is difficult to unionize in the American South. And this is the deal we make you. So every time a Southern politician goes out and they congratulate themselves about building the new car factory or the new battery maker in some rural part of their Southern. You state or municipality. What they have generally done is they have made a deal with either a national or a transnational conglomerate that says do not have to worry about unionizing. That is the deal, but it is a continuation of the same idea. Well, I do think it is interesting you brought up the economic piece of this. I come from a town. When I was there, it was when I was growing up, there was about 8,000 people. We had three stoplights in Kentucky, a rural town in Kentucky. That's where I spent my elementary and high school years. And it's unrecognizable now because a Toyota manufacturing plant came there and completely transformed the city. But these are good, high paying jobs. They are transformative jobs in these parts of the South. But it is absolutely true that they also pull and draw jobs from other parts of America. And it's one of the reasons why I think so many people have been moving to the South, which is let me erase that. One of the interesting elements to me about the current national moment is that it's not just that the politics of the South are so dominant in many ways. As I mentioned earlier, the culture and economics of the South are growing more dominant as well. And you've had a huge in-migration from other parts of the country coming into the South, into the Sun Belt, Texas growing in population, Florida growing in population. Tennessee at Nashville, where I am, has been exploding in population. Why What are you seeing are the reasons for that. What are the reasons for why the South. Aside from climate, which is better than other parts of the country, but some days can feel a little too hot for a little too long. Why is that. Why is it functioning as such a magnet right now in American migration. Jamelle, I'll start with you. That's an interesting question. I think it's a couple of things. It is economic development. And I want to quickly just say like I'm not opposed to the construction of factories down South. I'm opposed to the exploitation of labor. So if you can have if you can have good, well-paying jobs with people who have meaningful economic freedom and important say and can collectively bargain, that's great. It's when that it's when the deal is you get this job and also you shut up and you like it. And if we decide that we're going to take this job away, or we're going to subject you to worse conditions, you just have to accept it, because it could be worse. There could be nothing. That's what I object to. But as far as migration, it's certainly economic growth. It's housing. Part of what's happening is in on the West Coast and in the Northeast, basically the housing markets are calcified. There's very little new building. And so if you want to own a home, which is still a dream for many Americans, you go to where the homes are and the homes are in Greenfield development throughout the South. Yeah, Jamelle points out something really elegant, which is that one of the things that has happened with our internal migration is that plenty of solidly middle class, upper middle, upper middle class, upwardly mobile white Americans are feeling, I think, at just a basic demographic level, a push and a pull that they have not had to participate in or haven't felt in quite some time. I mean, we're looking at a push and pull that is very close to the urbanization of the United States at one point in time. And so people are feeling, I think, a push out of some places. As Jamelle points out, the high cost of housing, the high cost of transportation. And then I would also say just the friction of trying to support like a family life in some of those places, how difficult that then becomes the high cost of child care being one that I think about a great deal. And then I think the things pulling people are that our culture has been nationalized to a certain point, that once you learn how to accept grits and say, y'all, you'll fit in and you'll do fine. And so there's less friction there about migrating and moving across region than I think there used to be. And then I want to put a finer point on this thing about economic development and across to Southern economy that you alluded to there, David, which is yeah, you can build a new plant that creates all of these good paying jobs. But the story over and over again has been, especially in the South, that doesn't necessarily improve mobility and the quality of life for people native to the area. So the opportunity structure that I tend to be interested in the South is O.K. Well, build me a wind farm that then transforms the mobility of the people who have been here intergenerationally who are of trapped to that sticky floor of the bottom of the economic ladder in the South. And what we're seeing here is not just a transplant of people, but of ideas that don't necessarily create that kind of mobility for Southern workers across the South, which then leads to a war, a battle for the soul of rural America that you can feel very tangibly in the South. That is just about I think these yeah, these demographic push and pulls that are moving people around the country in these ways that concern people about their political hold on their homes. Yeah well, you both have mentioned housing and cost of living. And in my experience, I've talked to a lot of transplants who've come to Tennessee a lot. And what they will say time and time again. Is that the exact thing that you said about housing and expenses, that they feel as if they just couldn't afford. The American dream in California, they couldn't afford it in New York, but they absolutely can afford it in Nashville, or at least could until Nashville became almost as expensive as some of these cities. But is there anything that the Democratic Party can learn from this. If you've got entire regions of the country that are pulling citizens at scale from core blue areas into these red areas, what can Democrats learn from a matter of policy. I want to make two points about this. And it's going to reflect, I think, what Democrats can do. But the limits of that, what Democrats can do, obviously, is in places where they have unified control, they can make it easier to build housing. I mean, there, I think Democratic led states should try to stem the bleeding, right. Like make it easier to construct housing for the people who want to stay, who like where they are. As Tressie said, it is quite difficult to get people to move, and some people are moving because they feel they don't really have any choice. But I also want to say that part of the allure of the South as a cultural object, and this is getting back to what Tressie said earlier about cost of living is not simply that things might be cheaper, but that you have an opportunity to use your wealth, for lack of a better term to dominate other people. You can have a big compound in the middle of Texas and drive a gigantic vehicle and use all the resources you like and boss people around. And that is it's the Yellowstone-ification sonification of the country. Jamelle yes, yes. And that aspect of it cannot. You can't. There's nothing there's no policy you can do to compete with that, I guess, because what a place that California is offering the trade off is it's going to be more expensive to live here. You won't be able to unless you are in the highest echelon of income earners. You're not going to be able to hire someone to look after your house for dirt cheap, right. You won't be able to exploit someone so easily, but you are going to live in this multicultural. Yeah cosmopolitan place where people are going to exist at least like culturally, at least on some plane of equality. And if you like that. If you like that kind of life and experience, that's what you're here in L.A. for. That's what you're here in New York for. That's what you here in Chicago for. And all the places that are kind of their own places, but offer a smaller or more manageable version of that thing. People are going to want to choose that. And are going to make the sacrifices necessary to choose that. And then the people who want to be able to live the Yellowstone life are going to choose that which also comes with their own set of sacrifices. And so there is I would say there really is a competing, competing visions of what the good life is in the United States and parts of the South, or in the cultural imagination of the nation. The South offers one particular vision. And there are things, perhaps, that blue states within the South as well. There are things you can do to say, well if you're leaving, because specifically because the cost of housing is so high, we can do something about that. But the cultural thing is the cultural thing, and that's a struggle. That's not going to happen in the realm of politics such that it is a struggle and not just simply like a thing. That is the case about this country that we share. Yeah, I think about I'm not comfortable with telling the Democratic Party what they need to do. I'm much more comfortable saying, I can tell you what I think people are saying they need done for them. And whoever steps into the void to do that, that's politics. Come and give us your vision. And I think one of the things that happened with the Democratic Party in the South, and I'm just going to say this plainly, as someone who's seen it. The Democratic Party's just has to reckon with the fact that if it wants to matter politically, it has to negotiate with black political power. And if it wants to be viable and competitive with the Republican Party, that is figuring out a message of economic populism that cuts across some race differences. It had better figure out how to invest in and grow the Black political infrastructure. One of the challenges, I think, that the Democratic Party is facing in this moment is that just like everyday life of Black political life in the South has changed. So you see this decline of what we like call chocolate cities. A place like Atlanta or D.C., seeing these massive demographic changes, which does weaken the Black political structure of the South, which the DNC needs. And then you whichever party is going to respond to the economic pain of America is going to have to respond to how complicated it is to get the right economic message when So much of that is embedded in racism. And just because it is hard doesn't mean you get to write off the American South, because it's just too hard to come up with an economic message when you have to also deal with deep racial divisions. My argument has been, if you cannot sell your economic message in the South, you are not going to be able to win, right. You do not deserve a national economic message. If that economic message makes no sense. It's incoherent when you bring it to South Carolina or when you bring it to Georgia, or when you bring it to rural parts of the American South. And they have not figured that out. Now, the Republican Party hasn't figured that out either. But what they have figured out is that if you play to the National impulse of grievance strongly enough, deeply enough, you can get people to buy into national politics because there is no local politics happening around them that they can see. There's no local politics that is serving them. Now, is this is unfair. This is an asymmetry in our political system that the Democratic Party needs that message more than Republicans do. But life is not fair, little girl. As my mother liked to tell me. Politics are not fair, little girl. You still have to go out there and shape a message for them. And if you don't do that, then the National message of grievance will win out every time. In my experience, it's almost as if outside of the local power centers within the South, the Democratic Party even is taking seriously the idea of competing. Yeah, one of the things that is puzzling to me is why does with a few exceptions, the Southern Democratic Party consistently bring candidates to the polls who are every bit, for example, as socially liberal as you have, say, a Democratic candidate in the West Coast or the East Coast. How about a more aggressive outreach to more socially moderate and socially conservative voters in the South. And it seems as if that's that very idea is sometimes an anathema. I mean, yeah, I think the exact opposite is true. I think the exact opposite is true, that what we see, certainly in my part of the South, I talked to local politicians all the time who would love the support of the Democratic Party, is that they have a message to local constituents on the ground who absolutely want oh, I don't tenant owned cooperative housing, who absolutely want to increase their local minimum wage or they want a living wage. These are things that at a more like nationalized level, sound socially liberal and out of step with our idea of Southern voters, but that Southern voters want they will have a candidate who wants to deliver on that for them locally. But because that message doesn't fit the Democrats national message that they find they don't get a lot of the state party support for those candidates. And I actually think that across the South, especially with poor and working class Southerners, strong economic messages that may sound deeply radical on the national stage can play fairly well at home if they trust the political party. Now, there's a whole lot, and there's a whole lot to be said there that race and education come into play. But if they trust their local political party can be far more radical now. I think at the state level, again, especially in places like North Carolina, we tend to prefer a more socially conservative performance of Southern politics at our state level. But on the ground, especially when you're talking about local elections, it is that the Democratic Party wants to run a far more conservative candidate than can excite the base across rural, the rural parts of the South. I want to also add to this point about trust, which isn't just about what's happening in Southern politics, but national politics. I often think that the desire for candidates, to say, why don't Democrats just want to run. Someone who holds more conservative social views is an attempt to do a shortcut to the trust question that the equation being offered is if you hold x, z moderate to conservative social position, this will buy you the trust you need with the critical voters. You need to win to be able to win an election. But I just don't think that works. I think we've seen quite clearly that it just doesn't work, that the distrust that the trust deficit is so deep that there's no messaging along those lines that's necessarily going to bridge that gap. And so the question is, well, how do you fix the trust deficit. And that is kind of rebuilding I think the Democratic Party not as basically like a glorified messaging organ, but as an actually present local organization that is engaged in the kind of work that local organizations are engaged in. You can build trust, the force of personality. But for parties to build trust, they have to build trust through, I think, actually delivering things to the people they hope to serve in delivering can happen at the level of the state. It could also happen at the level of para state organizations. And that's what I would say. I think, for example, I think that it would be a good idea for the Democratic Party to make serious investments in Mississippi, a state where Democratic candidates with no investment, routinely hit the mid 40s in statewide elections. That's a clear sign. Like it's going to be really hard to close that gap because of racial polarization in the state. But the gap can be closed, and making Mississippi competitive would be a huge blow to Republicans. Changes the game, changes the map. It changes the game. It does. Yeah what does that look like. Well, what that looks like is redefining what the Democratic Party is. Mississippi, a state where there is such low state investment, will use the Democratic Party as just a private organization, as a venue for public investment. Local Democratic parties are creating public spaces for people to gather. Local Democratic parties are providing basic services fixing your taillight offering tutors for your kids, that kind of thing, and building trust. So that when election time does come around, it isn't vote for us because you have some cultural affinity for us. It's vote for us because we've done something for you, and we'll do something for you if you put us into office. All right. On that note, let's move on to our recommendations. So, Tressie as the guest of honor, you're first. Oh, I am. My stuff lately has not been a whole lot of fun. My reading. I just finished rereading my first time in a while, reading \"Deacons of Defense.\" So if anybody wants to talk about armed resistance across the American South, I'm primed for that. But I guess that's not lighter. Yeah, I just finished rereading. I hadn't read that since undergrad and found it especially powerful. Reading it today. Jamelle? I have been on a Duke Ellington kick for some time. I went through this thing where I was like, I've never. Obviously, I know who Duke Ellington is, but never really listened to Duke Ellington in a serious way. So just wanting to sit down and seriously listen to Duke Ellington. And I had this experience of being like, yeah, this guy, this guy rules. As it turns out. Yeah Yeah. As it turns out, this guy is. This guy's great. So I want to recommend his 1943 piece for his first concert at Carnegie Hall. That's called \"Black, Brown and Beige.\" And it was Ellington's attempt to tell the story of Black America in jazz. And it kind of composed jazz symphony. There is a version of it that he recorded in 1958 with Mahalia Jackson. That is absolutely wonderful. And you can find that for streaming on Apple or Spotify or whatever, but I highly recommend it. And just like to really don't like, listen to it while you're doing things like just listen to it and sit with it and actually try to experience it because it is just you'll listen to it and you'll be like yeah, Duke Ellington is one of the great composers of all time. Like, not just great American composers, but one of the singularly great composers that has ever lived. Well, mine is grim. Mine is a movie called \"A House of Dynamite.\" It's a Kathryn Bigelow film. And it's. The premise is it's just a normal day at the office in the American National defense establishment until a ballistic missile launch is detected, and then everything changes all at once in the most tense ways imaginable. So Kathryn Bigelow's very adept at directing tense thriller type movies. Very tense, very sobering, very good movie. So with that, we'll wrap it up. Tressie, Jamelle, thanks so much for chatting. Oh, it's always a pleasure. Yeah, it's a real pleasure to see you all, even if it is virtually.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/video/opinion/100000010462025/how-southern-politics-shaped-trumpism.html"}
