        "description": "Progressive firebrand David Hogg campaigned for congressional candidate Aftyn Behn ahead of the upcoming special election. (Credit: tnhsdems via Instagram - Saturday, Nov. 15, 2025)\n\nFor the first time since losing the 2024 presidential election, former Vice President Kamala Harris returned to the campaign trail on Tuesday, this time in a surprise appearance with Democratic congressional candidate Aftyn Behn.\n\nFox News confirmed that Harris headlined a canvassing kickoff event for the Tennessee state representative after visiting Fisk University, a historically Black college, and before hosting a book tour event for her memoir \"107 Days\" at the Ryman Auditorium in Nashville, Tennessee.\n\nTuesday's canvass kickoff marked the first time Harris has campaigned for a candidate since losing the White House to President Donald Trump a year ago, and her appearance comes as Democrats are energized from their gubernatorial wins in Virginia and New Jersey earlier this month. While a Democrat hasn't won in Tennessee's 7th Congressional District in decades, Democrats have been all in for the ruby-red district.\n\n\"Kamala Harris must've fallen out of the coconut tree if she thinks the AOC of Tennessee stands a chance. This is Trump country and Republicans will win Dec. 2,\" Republican National Committee spokeswoman Delanie Bomar told Fox News Digital in a statement.\n\nSCOOP: TRUMP-ALIGNED MAGA INC. JUMPS INTO HIGH STAKES BALLOT BOX CONGRESSIONAL SHOWDOWN\n\nThe former vice president told the crowd at Nashville's Hadley Park, \"Why am I in Tennessee? Because I know the power is in the South,\" according to The New York Times.\n\nThe outlet noted that Harris did not mention Behn by name but urged the crowd to get out the vote.\n\nHarris first returned to the campaign trail earlier this month for a rally supporting her home state's redistricting efforts. California Gov. Gavin Newsom ordered a special election this year to level the playing field against Trump-backed efforts to redraw congressional maps in Texas and across the U.S. ahead of the upcoming midterm elections. \"Prop 50\" passed on Election Day, handing Democrats up to five more likely blue congressional districts.\n\nDEMOCRAT AFTYN BEHN ADVANCES TO SPECIAL ELECTION IN BATTLE FOR VACANT CONGRESSIONAL SEAT IN DEEP-RED DISTRICT\n\nFormer Democratic National Committee vice chair and progressive firebrand David Hogg also campaigned in Nashville last weekend for Behn, the rising liberal star dubbed the \"AOC of Tennessee.\"\n\n\"Hey, young Democrats, I am incredibly excited to be here supporting Aftyn in her run for Congress,\" Hogg said in an Instagram video while flanked by two young Democrats. \"This seat is super, super youth-centric. If young people turn out and vote here, we can flip this seat and send a clear message to Donald Trump and Republicans across the country that we are done with their bulls--- and the rest of the country is.\"\n\nOn Saturday, Hogg joined Behn in Nashville for a \"Young Gets It Done\" rally and canvass launch at the Metro Courthouse Public Square, encouraging young voters to get out and support Behn.\n\nAccording to her campaign website, Behn is a \"p---ed off social worker\" who decided to run for Congress after Republicans passed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act earlier this year -- a megabill that included tax cuts and Medicaid reform.\n\nBehn described the bill as \"a giveaway to the wealthy that codified the largest transfer of wealth from working people to the rich in American history.\"\n\nShe is a state representative in the Tennessee House and a longtime community organizer and activist. Like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., the fellow millennial is active on social media. She also authors a Substack page that is linked to the \"Issues\" tab on her campaign website.\n\nDNC Chair Ken Martin also campaigned in Tennessee for Behn last week as early voting kicked off across the state, highlighting her agenda to lower \"healthcare and grocery costs, vote to release the Epstein files, and stand up to Trump and his acolytes like Van Epps.\"\n\nBehn is vying to replace former Rep. Mark Green, R-Tenn., in Congress. A Democrat hasn't been elected to represent Tennessee's 7th District in the U.S. House of Representatives in decades.\n\nRepublican Matt Van Epps, a former commissioner of the Tennessee Department of General Services who has worked for several state agencies, defeated an 11-candidate field to secure the Republican nomination last month.\n\nWhile Behn has the support of both the Democratic establishment and its progressive wing, Van Epps has secured endorsements from President Donald Trump, Republican Gov. Bill Lee and Green, who retired from Congress after the \"big, beautiful bill\" passed this year.\n\nTrump held a tele-rally for Van Epps last week in the district the president won by roughly 22 points last year. Tennessee's 7th District includes parts of Nashville and its large suburban and rural surrounding areas.\n\nThe top outside political group that supported Trump's successful 2024 run, MAGA Inc., also launched ads to support Van Epps on Wednesday, Fox News Digital was the first to report.\n\nThe ads, which MAGA Inc. says will run on broadcast TV and digital and are backed by a seven-figure buy that also includes investments in get-out-the-vote efforts, are the first by the group since last year's presidential election.\n\nCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nMeanwhile, the RNC has staff on the ground in Tennessee and is making a six-figure investment into the race, according to a spokesperson.\n\nFox News Digital reached out to Harris' office for a response to the RNC's comment but did not immediately hear back.",

        "description": "Billionaire hedge fund founder Tom Steyer said he's running to be the next governor of California, seeking to replace Gov. Gavin Newsom, whose second and final term ends in January 2027.\n\nThe 68-year-old Democrat is no stranger to politics. He ran a long-shot campaign for president in 2020, played a role in advocating for President Trump's impeachment and spent millions to help pass California's Proposition 50.\n\n\"We have a broken government. It's been bought by corporations, and my question is: Who do you think is going to change that? Sacramento politicians are afraid to change up this system. I'm not,\" Mr. Steyer said in his campaign video on Wednesday. \"They're going to hate this. Bring it on.\"\n\nHis campaign platform includes making California more affordable, such as by lowering electric bills, building 1 million new homes within four years and making preschool and community college free.\n\n\"Californians deserve a life they can afford. But the Californians who make this state run are being run over by the cost of living,\" Mr. Steyer said. \" We need to get back to basics.\"\n\nHe is joining a tightly packed race, as eight Democrats and two Republicans have already entered.\n\nThis includes former Rep. Katie Porter, Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco, former Fox News host Steve Hilton, real estate magnate Stephen Cloobeck, former Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra, State Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond, former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and former State Controller Betty Yee.\n\nMr. Steyer founded one of the nation's largest hedge funds, Farallon Capital Management, and left in 2012. The company's investments may become a pressure point rivals use against him, such as with a coal mine in Australia that cleared thousands of acres of koala habitat.\n\nThe environmental activist said he regretted his involvement in such projects, which coaxed him to start fighting climate change.",

        "title": "Trump's congressional gerrymandering push is getting complicated for the GOP",
        "description": "As President Donald Trump laid it out to reporters this summer, the plan was simple.\n\nRepublicans, the president said, were \"entitled\" to five more conservative-leaning U.S. House seats in Texas and additional ones in other red states. The president broke with more than a century of political tradition in directing the GOP to redraw those maps in the middle of the decade to avoid losing control of Congress in next year's midterms.\n\nFour months later, Trump's audacious ask looks anything but simple. After a federal court panel struck down Republicans' new map in Texas on Tuesday, the entire exercise holds the potential to net Democrats more winnable seats in the House instead.\n\n\"Trump may have let the genie out of the bottle,\" said UCLA law professor Rick Hasen, \"but he may not get the wish he'd hoped for.\"\n\nTrump's plan is to bolster his party's narrow House margin to protect Republicans from losing control of the chamber in next year's elections. Normally, the president's party loses seats in the midterms. But his involvement in redistricting is instead becoming an illustration of the limits of presidential power.\n\nTo hold Republicans' grip on power in Washington, Trump is relying on a complex political process.\n\nRedrawing maps is a decentralized effort that involves navigating a tangle of legal rules. It also involves a tricky political calculus because the legislators who hold the power to draw maps often want to protect themselves, business interests or local communities more than ruthlessly help their party.\n\nAnd when one party moves aggressively to draw lines to help itself win elections -- also known as gerrymandering -- it runs the risk of pushing its rival party to do the same.\n\nThat's what Trump ended up doing, spurring California voters to replace their map drawn by a nonpartisan commission with one drawn by Democrats to gain five seats. If successful, the move would cancel out the action taken by Texas Republicans. California voters approved that map earlier this month, and if a Republican lawsuit fails to block it, that map giving Democrats more winnable seats will remain in effect even if Texas' remains stalled.\n\n\"Donald Trump and Greg Abbott played with fire, got burned -- and democracy won,\" California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, posted on X after the Texas ruling, mentioning his Republican counterpart in Texas along with the president.\n\nRep. Kevin Kiley, a Republican whose northern California district would be redrawn under the state's new map, agreed.\n\n\"It could very well come out as a net loss for Republicans, honestly when you look at the map, or at the very least, it could end up being a wash,\" Kiley said. \"But it's something that never should have happened. It was ill-conceived from the start.\"\n\nThere's no guarantee that Tuesday's ruling on the Texas map will stand. Many lower courts have blocked Trump's initiatives, only for the conservative majority on the U.S. Supreme Court to put those rulings on hold. Texas Republicans immediately appealed Tuesday's decision to the high court, too.\n\nRepublicans hope the nation's highest court also weakens or eliminates the last major component of the Voting Rights Act next year, which could open the door to further redraws in their favor.\n\nEven before Tuesday, Trump's push for mid-decade redistricting was not playing out as neatly as he had hoped, though he had scored some apparent wins. North Carolina Republicans potentially created another conservative-leaning seat in that battleground state, while Missouri Republicans redrew their congressional map at Trump's urging to eliminate one Democratic seat. The Missouri plan faces lawsuits and a possible referendum that would force a statewide vote on the matter.\n\nTrump's push has faltered elsewhere. Republicans in Kansas balked at trying to eliminate the state's lone swing seat, held by a Democratic congresswoman. Indiana Republicans also refused to redraw their map to eliminate their two Democratic-leaning congressional seats.\n\nAfter Trump attacked the main Indiana holdout, state Sen. Greg Goode, on social media, he was the victim of a swatting call over the weekend that led to sheriff's deputies coming to his house.\n\nThe bulk of redistricting normally happens once every 10 years, following the release of new population estimates from the U.S. Census. That requires state lawmakers to adjust their legislative lines to make sure every district has roughly the same population. It also opens the door to gerrymandering maps to make it harder for the party out of power to win legislative seats.\n\nInevitably, redistricting leads to litigation, which can drag on for years and spur mid-decade, court-mandated revisions.\n\nRepublicans stood to benefit from these after the last cycle in 2021 because they won state supreme court elections in North Carolina and Ohio in 2022. But some litigation hasn't gone the GOP's way. A judge in Utah earlier this month required the state to make one of its four congressional seats Democratic-leaning.\n\nTrump broke with modern political practice by urging a wholesale, mid-decade redraw in red states.\n\nDemocrats were in a bad position to respond to Trump's gambit because more states they control have lines drawn by independent commissions rather than by partisan lawmakers, the legacy of government reform efforts.\n\nBut with Newsom's push to let Democrats draw California's lines successful, the party is looking to replicate it elsewhere.\n\nNext up may be Virginia, where Democrats recaptured the governor's office this month and expanded their margins in the Legislature. A Democratic candidate for governor in Colorado has called for a similar measure there. Republicans currently hold 9 of the 19 House seats in those two states.\n\nOverall, Republicans have more to lose if redistricting becomes a purely partisan activity nationally and voters in blue states ditch their nonpartisan commissions to let their preferred party maximize its margins. In the last complete redistricting cycle in 2021, commissions drew 95 House seats that Democrats would have otherwise drawn, and only 13 that Republicans would have drawn.\n\nOn Tuesday, Republicans were reappraising Trump's championing of redistricting hardball.\n\n\"I think if you look at the basis of this, there was no member of the delegation that was asked our opinion,\" Republican Rep. Pete Sessions of Texas told reporters.\n\nIncumbents usually don't like the idea of radically redrawing districts. It can lead to what political experts call a \"dummymander\" -- spreading the opposing party's voters so broadly that they end up endangering your own incumbents in a year, like 2026, that is expected to be bad for the party in power.\n\nIncumbents also don't like losing voters who have supported them or getting wholly new communities drawn into their districts, said Jonathan Cervas, who teaches redistricting at Carnegie Mellon University and has drawn new maps for courts. Democratic lawmakers in Illinois and Maryland have so far resisted mid-decade redraws to pad their majorities in their states, joining their GOP counterparts in Indiana and Kansas.\n\nCervas said that's why it was striking to watch Trump push Republicans to dive into mid-decade redistricting.\n\n\"The idea they'd go along to get along is basically crazy,\" he said.",

Lloyd Doggett, D-Texas, suggested that he no longer plans to retire after federal judges ruled against a Republican-backed plan to alter Texas' congressional districts on Tuesday.\n\nDoggett had announced his qualified retirement earlier this year after Texas Republicans revealed a new redistricting map that would have pitted Doggett, 79, against fellow Texas Democratic Rep. Rep. Greg Casar, 36. Now that map's future is in jeopardy, however.\n\n\"To borrow from Mark Twain I can happily say that the reports of my death politically are greatly exaggerated,\" Doggett said in a video posted to social media.\n\n\"I'm very fortunate to have the opportunity to continue to represent the only town I've ever called home, at a time when democracy faces the greatest challenges that it has ever faced at any point in my lifetime,\" Doggett's statement continued. \"Thank you.\"\n\nABBOTT CLEARS FINAL REDISTRICTING HURDLE AS TEXAS SENATE PASSES NEW TRUMP-APPROVED MAP\n\nDoggett's newfound confidence comes after a federal panel of judges ruled 2-1 that the GOP redistricting map appeared to constitute an illegal, race-based gerrymander.\n\n\"The public perception of this case is that it's about politics,\" U.S. District Judge Jeffrey V.

Greg Abbott sharply criticized the court's ruling Tuesday, saying in a statement that Texas legislators \"redrew our congressional maps to better reflect Texans' conservative voting preferences -- and for no other reason.\"\n\n\"Any claim that these maps are discriminatory is absurd and unsupported by the testimony offered during ten days of hearings,\" he added.",

        "description": "Interior Secretary Doug Burgum discusses 'delivering prosperity at home' and 'peace abroad' on 'America Reports.'\n\nThere's a battle to define a narrative about what's to blame for rising electricity prices. Some claim higher electricity prices are due to President Donald Trump's \"One Big Beautiful Bill,\" which curtailed subsidies for \"cheap\" wind and solar installations. Others blame AI's rapidly expanding appetite for electricity, while some blame inflation. None of these charges hold up under scrutiny.\n\nBut shifting blame, usually with the help of a complicit media, helps with the only thing that matters to most politicians: seizing political power.\n\nThis is readily seen in California Democrat Gov. Gavin Newsom's trip to Bel\u00e9m, Brazil, to rub elbows with the global elite at the UN's COP30 global climate conference on Nov. 11. Newsom, an all-but-declared candidate for the Democratic nomination for president in 2028, slammed the Trump administration for not attending the confab, accusing the president of \"handing the future to China,\" presumably in the category of selling solar panels embedded with secret kill switches.\n\nNewsom went on to say that \"We're not turning backwards to the failed policies of the past -- California is fighting for a clean-energy future, even as President Trump bends the knee to his Gulf-State patrons and takes a nap as the world burns.\" Newsom also claimed that California is now operating its grid on \"two-thirds clean energy,\" with California operating on 100% non-fossil-fuel energy for at least part of the day nine out of 10 days this year.\n\nNEWSOM CLAIMS TRUMP IS 'HANDING THE FUTURE TO CHINA' AT BRAZILIAN CLIMATE CONFAB THAT WH SKIPPED\n\nBut California now has the nation's second-highest electricity prices second-highest electricity prices, only behind Hawaii, with the Golden State's electricity prices rising the most of any state since 2010: 127%, according to a new report from Jonathan A. Lesser, Ph.D., a senior fellow with the National Center for Energy Analytics.\n\nThe truth that Newsom doesn't want Californians -- or Democratic primary voters -- to know is that \"green\" energy is expensive energy. That's because, \"60% of the time, (wind and solar) works every time\" to borrow from the much-memed comedy \"Anchorman.\" And, it's very costly to make sure the power is on when wind and solar aren't producing.\n\nThis, Lesser notes, is one of the main culprits in rising electricity costs.\n\nLIZ PEEK: TRUMP WHITE HOUSE FIRED UP ABOUT KING COAL'S RETURN TO POWER\n\nThe Biden-Harris administration's reckless push for subsidized wind and solar -- and California's before that and since -- has destabilized our grid and forced consumers to foot the bill for fortifying unreliable \"green\" energy with reliable gas power and expensive batteries -- the latter of limited utility.\n\nFrom the first quarter of 2010 to the second quarter of 2025, average residential electricity rates across the U.S. surged by about 63%, according to Energy Information Administration (EIA) data. But the pain isn't evenly distributed. States like Massachusetts and California not only endured the steepest hikes, but now boast two of the nation's highest rates -- over 30 cents per kilowatt-hour in some cases.\n\nCritics peddle all sorts of excuses for these increases. One target is data centers, those power-hungry hubs fueling AI and cloud computing. Sure, they consume a lot of power -- Virginia, a data center hotspot, has seen demand rise. But Virginia's rates? Below-average increases and still under the national norm. If data centers are the villain, why isn't the Old Dominion suffering like California?\n\nTRUMP'S UN SPEECH REVEALS INCONVENIENT TRUTH OF MASSIVE GREEN ENERGY COSTS\n\nA recent International Renewable Energy Agency report touts falling costs for renewables. But as Lesser's analysis shows, that's a half-truth at best. Subsidies like the federal production tax credit -- now $27.50 per megawatt-hour -- let wind and solar operators undercut the market with negative bids, distorting wholesale prices and squeezing out reliable baseload plants -- which end up not being built.\n\nHere's the missing link the green advocates ignore: the shift in our generating mix. Between 2010 and 2024, U.S. electricity capacity grew 16% to 1,325 gigawatts, outpacing a mere 5% rise in retail sales. Sounds good, right? Wrong. Dispatchable sources -- coal, gas and nuclear, which can ramp up on demand -- plummeted by 80 gigawatts. Intermittent wind and solar ballooned seven-fold, to 278 gigawatts.\n\nThis trend accelerated in 2025: More than 1,900 megawatts of fossil fuel retired by July, with another 12,600 megawatts slated for shutdown by year's end and into 2026. What's replacing them? More subsidized wind, solar, and pricey batteries.\n\nTRUMP'S ENERGY PRICE PROMISE IS COMING DUE. HE HAS THE POWER TO SOLVE THE CRISIS\n\nIt's policy malpractice. States like New Jersey and New York forced premature closures of reliable power plants such as Oyster Creek nuclear in 2018 and Indian Point in 2021, which powered a quarter of New York City's needs.\n\nBiden-era EPA rules, now being rolled back under Trump, would have shuttered most coal plants by 2032. Mandates for cars to have \"zero-emissions\" by 2035 in places like California ignore reality. Where will they get the electricity? Wind and solar can't provide inertia or reactive power, essential for grid stability.\n\nNEWSOM PUSHES CLIMATE RECORD ABROAD AS CALIFORNIANS SHOULDER AMERICA'S HIGHEST GAS COSTS\n\nThe truth that Newsom doesn't want Californians -- or Democratic primary voters -- to know is that \"green\" energy is expensive energy.\n\nTrump's One Big Beautiful Bill -- only now going into effect, so any electricity price increases to this point aren't due to the law -- flips the script. By rescinding President Joe Biden's vehicle emission standards and fossil fuel crackdowns, it prioritizes affordable, dispatchable energy. Expect more nuclear builds, streamlined pipelines and fewer handouts to Big Green. This won't spike prices -- it'll stabilize them by restoring reliable supply.\n\nCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBiden's (and Newsom's) green zealotry promised cheap power, but delivered the opposite: unaffordable, unreliable electricity that hampers economic growth. Trump's reforms demonstrate that true energy independence means ditching the myths and embracing what works.\n\nAmericans deserve a grid that powers prosperity, not one that bankrupts it.",

        "title": "Appeals court pauses California law requiring companies to report climate-related financial risk",
        "description": "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- A U.S. appeals court on Tuesday paused a California law set to take effect in January requiring large companies to report every two years on how climate change could hurt them financially.\n\nAnother new law requiring major companies to annually disclose their carbon emissions can stay in place for now, the court ruled.\n\nThe policies would be the most sweeping of their kind in the nation, and proponents say they would increase transparency and encourage companies to assess how they can cut their emissions.\n\nThe U.S. Chamber of Commerce asked the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to pause the laws, which were set to take effect next year, arguing they violate the companies' First Amendment rights. The group also asked the Supreme Court last week to weigh in. The Chamber of Commerce on Tuesday withdrew its emergency appeal to the Supreme Court, citing the lower court's decision.\n\n\"We look forward to continuing our appeal and securing an injunction of both climate disclosure laws, which result in massive compliance costs for companies and their supply chains,\" Chamber of Commerce lawyer Daryl Joseffer said of Tuesday's ruling. \"One state should not have the ability to impose this kind of burden on the entire country.\"\n\nLindsay Buckley, a spokesperson for the California Air Resources Board, which is drafting rules to implement the laws, said the agency was reviewing the ruling and could not comment further. The state has argued that the laws don't violate the First Amendment because commercial speech isn't protected the same way under the Constitution.\n\nThe financial risk disclosure law, which Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom signed in 2023, applies to companies making more than $500 million a year that do business in California. The Air Resources Board estimates more than 4,100 businesses will have to comply with the legislation.\n\nThe emissions reporting law, which the state passed the same year, applies to businesses that make more than $1 billion a year and do business in the state -- which covers roughly 2,600 companies, according to state air regulators. They will have to report planet-warming pollution from burning fossil fuels directly, as well as releases from activities such as delivering products from warehouses to stores and employee business travel.\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved a rule last year requiring some public companies to report their greenhouse gas emissions and climate risks, but the agency paused the regulation amid litigation.",

        "description": "Washington -- A federal court on Tuesday blocked Texas from using its newly redrawn congressional map in the upcoming 2026 midterm elections, a setback for Republicans as they work to maintain their narrow majority in the House.\n\nIn a decision authored by U.S. District Judge Jeffrey Brown, the court ordered the state to instead use House district lines adopted by the Texas legislature in 2021 for next year's congressional elections. The dispute was heard by a three-judge panel, which divided 2-1 in finding that voting rights and advocacy groups that challenged the redistricting plan were likely to prove that the 2025 map is an unconstitutional racial gerrymander.\n\nThe court found that plaintiffs will likely succeed in showing that race predominated over partisanship in the map-making process, and said the state legislature appears to have set and followed a racial target.\n\n\"The public perception of this case is that it's about politics. To be sure, politics played a role in drawing the 2025 Map,\" Brown, appointed to the federal bench by President Trump in 2019, wrote. \"But it was much more than just politics. Substantial evidence shows that Texas racially gerrymandered the 2025 Map.\"\n\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, said the decision will be appealed directly to the Supreme Court.\n\n\"Legislature redrew our congressional maps to better reflect Texans' conservative voting preferences - and for no other reason. Any claim that these maps are discriminatory is absurd and unsupported by the testimony offered during ten days of hearings,\" he said in a statement. \"This ruling is clearly erroneous and undermines the authority the U.S. Constitution assigns to the Texas Legislature by imposing a different map by judicial edict.\"\n\nStill, the ruling marks an early blow for Republicans and Mr. Trump, who had urged Texas state lawmakers to engage in a mid-decade redrawing of their House map in order to bolster the GOP's chances of holding onto its majority in the lower chamber.\n\n\"A federal court just stopped one of the most brazen attempts to steal our democracy that Texas has ever seen,\" Texas House of Representatives Minority Leader Gene Wu said in a statement. \"Greg Abbott and his Republican cronies tried to silence Texans' voices to placate Donald Trump, but now have delivered him absolutely nothing.\"\n\nThe map approved by the Texas legislature, which was signed by Abbott in August, redraws the state's congressional districts to create five GOP-friendly seats. The effort in Texas kicked off a redistricting battle that has expanded to other states. In California, Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, pushed to recraft his state's voting boundaries, and voters there approved a ballot measure earlier this month to draw new congressional districts. The map unveiled by California Democrats shifts five of the state's House seats to be more favorable to Democrats in next year's midterm elections.\n\nIn both Missouri and North Carolina, state GOP lawmakers have approved new maps that target a single Democratic-held district in each state. But the battles over House district lines have also sparked court fights that seek to block the updated maps from taking effect.\n\nUnder the original lines adopted by Texas' GOP-led legislature in the wake of the 2020 Census, Republicans hold 25 of the state's 38 congressional seats, while Democrats control 12. The death of Rep. Sylvester Turner, a Democrat, has left one seat open. Those voting lines enacted in 2021 were used in the 2022 and 2024 House elections.\n\nBut with the GOP holding a razor-thin majority in the House, and Republicans at risk of losing their hold on the lower chamber, Mr. Trump's political team began pushing Texas GOP leaders earlier this year to explore redrawing the state's congressional map. That effort picked up steam after the Justice Department sent Abbott a letter in July alleging that some of the districts in the 2021 map were racial gerrymanders that violate the Constitution's 14th Amendment.\n\nThe letter from Harmeet Dhillon, head of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, threatened legal action if Texas didn't dismantle and re-configure four Democratic-held congressional districts, which she said were unconstitutional.\n\nAbbott then added redistricting to the agenda for a special session of the state legislature and directed state lawmakers to draw a new congressional map to address the Justice Department's concerns. The new redistricting plan, signed by Abbott in August, creates five new districts that are favorable to Republicans.\n\nSoon after the map received the green-light from state Republicans, a coalition of advocacy groups moved to block the state from using it in the upcoming House elections. The plaintiffs argued that Texas lawmakers engaged in an unconstitutional racial gerrymander when redrawing the lines, while the state said it relied exclusively on politics, not race, during the latest redistricting process.\n\nThe federal court in El Paso held a nine-day trial last month to address the claims and found that the nonprofit organizations were likely to prevail on their racial-gerrymandering claims.\n\nBrown wrote in his decision that the Justice Department, in its July letter, directed Texas to engage in racial gerrymandering when it ordered the state to rectify districts that it deemed problematic. The court said the Justice Department's letter effectively imposed a 50% racial target for Texas to meet when drawing congressional district lines.\n\nBrown also pointed to Abbott's actions in response to the letter, including his decision to add redistricting to the legislative agenda for the special session and his public statements.\n\n\"The Governor explicitly directed the Legislature to redistrict based on race. In press appearances, the Governor plainly and expressly disavowed any partisan objective and instead repeatedly stated that his goal was to eliminate coalition districts and create new majority-Hispanic districts,\" Brown wrote in his 160-page decision evaluating the redrawn map. \"The legislature adopted those racial objectives.\"\n\nThe court said that supporters of the new redistricting plan also made numerous statements that suggested they retooled the district lines to create more majority-Hispanic and majority-Black districts.\n\nThe judges also rejected any concerns that it is blocking the new map too close to the election. Courts typically avoid ordering late changes election rules to protect against voter confusion and disruption. But Brown wrote that if the new House districts can remain in place, voters will be forced to vote under a map that likely sorts them on the basis of race, depriving them of their right to participate in a \"free and fair election.\"\n\nAdditionally, because the candidate-filing deadline is Dec. 8, the court said that the 2026 congressional election is not yet underway.\n\n\"To allow legislatures to redistrict as close to elections as possible while limiting the courts' ability to review the constitutionality of that action -- even in extraordinary cases like this one -- would unduly tip the balance of the separation of powers between the legislative and judicial branches and impair the effectiveness of the Constitution's protections of voting rights,\" Brown wrote for the court.",

        "title": "Trump hasn't lost Hispanic voters yet  --  but warning lights are...",
        "description": "Is President Donald Trump losing the winning coalition he built just a year ago?\n\nHe's been the subject of premature political obituaries before -- but Republicans are worried about signs his gains with Hispanic voters are evaporating.\n\nTrump stunned pundits last year by very nearly winning the Hispanic vote outright: A constituency Democrats had come to take for granted suddenly seemed ready to realign with Republicans.\n\nBut the numbers from the off-year elections earlier this month tell a different story.\n\nNew Jersey townships with high proportions of Hispanic voters shifted heavily to the Democrats in the state's race for governor, according to a New York Times analysis of exit polls.\n\n\"Nine of the 10 townships that shifted the most toward Democrats from 2024 to 2025 had a Hispanic population of at least 60%,\" the paper noted.\n\nThere's less data on Latino voters from Virginia, but the results there appear tell the same story -- while Hispanic communities in California backed Gov. Gavin Newsom's referendum to redraw the Golden State's congressional districts to give Democrats more seats.\n\n\"The county with the highest share of Hispanic residents, Imperial, voted 59% to 41%\" for Newsom's plan, according to the Times -- though Trump won the Mexico-adjacent county last year.\n\nIf this is a backlash against Trump's immigration crackdown, the GOP is in a bind: That issue is integral to the MAGA agenda and non-negotiable with the party's base.\n\nIt's true that off-year elections have nothing like the massive turnout of presidential contests, and with fewer people voting, it takes far fewer people to produce a big swing.\n\nHispanics moved to the Democrats by significantly bigger margins than other constituencies, but it's possible that the most politically active Hispanics -- the most likely to vote even in an off-year -- are disproportionately Democratic.\n\nTrump is known for doing exceptionally well with \"low-propensity\" voters of all backgrounds, who often don't turn up at all if he isn't on the ballot.\n\nBut it's not only these election results that are sounding the alarm -- opinion polling of Hispanic voters also shows their support for Trump plummeting. (Though polls have been wrong about Trump before, of course.)\n\nThe economic concerns weighing on all voters weigh on Hispanics as well, and as a heavily working-class demographic, they may be especially alarmed by the high price of beef and other staples at the supermarket.\n\nA survey by the polling firm Equis, conducted before the elections this month, found Hispanic support for Trump on \"cost of living\" is 40 percentage points lower now than it was in 2024, the biggest change in his approval levels among this group (by comparison, he's lost 24 points with them on immigration).\n\nNevertheless, the media spectacle of ICE rounding up Latino illegal immigrants or raiding Hispanic-owned bakeries and other small businesses adds to the strain on the winning coalition Trump built in 2024, even if Hispanic citizens also want to see stronger border enforcement and a crackdown on unlawful migration.\n\nThe administration has to stand firm on immigration control without unnecessarily alienating the Hispanic voters Republican need -- and who've already shown they're willing to give Trump a chance.\n\nOne way Trump can do this is by emphasizing that his exertions against illegal immigration aren't only directed at those who come from Latin America.\n\nHe also must prioritize -- and publicize -- the worst offenders, countering the media's tendency to promote only the most sympathetic migrants' stories.\n\nBeyond that, the administration should reinforce its ties to American Hispanics, particularly those who own small businesses.\n\nIt's legacy-media wishful thinking when CNN's chief data analyst Harry Enten says, \"Latinos hate Donald Trump\" -- his overperformance with them in 2024, compared to what all analysts expected, is proof of that.\n\nWhat Trump and other Republicans have to do is show the relationship goes both ways, with Hispanic citizens a vital component of the GOP coalition.\n\nThere's no lack of prominent Hispanic leaders in the GOP -- some of them, notably Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, with presidential aspirations.\n\nBut what came within a hair's breadth of winning a majority of Hispanics for the Republican presidential ticket last year wasn't running an ethnic candidate, but running a candidate who stood firmly for both immigration restriction and working-class opportunity -- Donald Trump.\n\nWhat Trump did in 2024, the GOP can do again: MAGA is more compelling to Hispanics than the halfhearted compromises Republicans served up in the past.\n\nBut the GOP can't afford to be tone-deaf -- and the new voters Trump has brought in will soon depart if he doesn't do his damnedest to keep them.",

        "description": "Gov. Gavin Newsom has embraced the \"affordability\" talking point in the wake of socialist Zohran Mamdani's victory in the New York mayoral race -- yet California lags the nation on that front, with inflation well above the national average.\n\nInflation is the result of real-world policies that drive up costs -- and Golden State policies are toxic.\n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics collects consumer price index (CPI) measurements in 23 regions, reporting the info in staggered fashion every few months.\n\nOf the five worst regions, three are in California:\n\nSan Francisco-Oakland-Hayward had 2.5% inflation -- lower, but still above the US median.\n\nContrast those figures with inflation in red states like Texas: The Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington region had inflation of just 0.9%; Houston-Woodlands-Sugar Land was only slightly higher, at 1.1%.Inflation is a blue-state problem (New York-Newark-Jersey City suffered a 3.2% annual rate as of August) -- and especially a California problem.\n\nLocalized price hikes are the result of local factors: regulations that make housing more expensive; taxes that drive up gas prices; green energy mandates that raise utility bills; and state grants that spread cash without solving the problem of poverty -- where California is also first in the nation.\n\nMaking everything \"free\" or heavily subsidized doesn't solve the problem, but rather makes it worse:\n\nNewsom this year had to stop admitting illegal migrants into Medi-Cal, the state's Medicaid program, because it was driving the whole system toward insolvency.\n\nLiberal columnist Joe Garofoli, writing in the San Francisco Chronicle, warned that the Democrats' new focus on \"affordability\" could \"doom\" Newsom's presidential ambitions, since \"California is 13% more expensive than the country overall as of 2023.\"\n\nNewsom's only hope, he argued, is that \"Democratic voters starving for a leader\" overlook the gov's record in office and buy his \"promises about the future.\"\n\nBelatedly, state and local California officials are enacting laws that make it easier to build housing -- usually, high-rises near transit hubs. Even the feared Coastal Commission, under withering public criticism, is starting to relax its restrictions.\n\nBut that doesn't reduce the expense of \"green\" construction mandates or local transfer taxes. And dense development creates its own new costs.\n\nInflation is the result of high-tax, high-regulation policies the governor has championed. That's why California, the bluest of blue states, is losing more people than any other -- and why \"affordability\" looks like a losing issue for Newsom.",

        "description": "California Gov. Gavin Newsom roasted President Donald Trump as a \"piggy\" after the president went viral Tuesday for calling a female Bloomberg jouranlist \"piggy\" while she pressed him on his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein.\n\n\"Quiet, piggy,\" Newsom tweeted from his own X account on Tuesday. The governor's post was coupled with a photo of the president looking disgruntled as he tried to remove a right-fitting suit jacket.\n\nBut the governor and his team didn't stop there, as his press office continued the insults in a series of AI-created images and memes on their own X account.\n\n\"Piggies,\" the official account for Newsom's press office wrote in an X post, which was uploaded with a screenshot from a video of Trump hanging out with the late sex offender Epstein, whom he's been tied to in the Epstein files scandal.\n\nAnother tweet was an edited image of Trump's head attached to a pig's body.\n\nThe office went on to upload more \"quiet, piggy\" posts. Another one was an edited image of Trump with a pig head holding images of the ballroom that's being built where the White House's East Wing used to be. Others showed Trump scarfing down McDonald's meals, pasta and other food, and some mocked up Trump's body with added weight or pig features.\n\nNewsom's flame sesh came after Trump was widely condemned online for telling a female reporter to \"quiet, piggy\" in a video that went viral Monday.\n\nThe incident occurred while Trump was speaking with reporters aboard Air Force One last Friday. \"I know nothing about that,\" Trump said, when first asked what convicted sex trafficker Epstein meant when he wrote that the president \"knew about the girls\" in emails released by House Democrats last week. Trump went on to promise that Americans soon will find out everything Epstein knew about certain high-profile Democrats, including former President Bill Clinton.\n\n\"Jeffrey Epstein and I had a very bad relationship for many years,\" Trump added. A female Bloomberg reporter tried to follow that initial question up by asking Trump, if there was nothing incriminating in the government's Epstein Files, why he doesn't just personally order their release. However, Trump interrupted her.\n\nHe leaned in, pointed a finger at the journalist and said, \"Quiet. Quiet, piggy.\" The president then swiftly moved on to answer a question from CBS News reporter Jennifer Jacobs, who reported on the incident on her X account Friday.\n\nCheck out the exchange below and the Newsom's retaliatory X posts.",

        "description": "'The Big Weekend Show' panel discuss California Gov. Gavin Newsom's victory lap after the state passed Prop 50, which is expected to add more Democratic representation.\n\nPresident Donald Trump is amplifying his political targeting of Indiana Republicans who have been resisting calls from the president to move forward with congressional redistricting.\n\nTrump on Tuesday, for a third straight day, vowed to back primary challenges against state Republican lawmakers in the solidly red Midwestern state who didn't support his push to draw new maps in Indiana, which would create another GOP-leaning congressional district.\n\n\"A RINO State Senator, Rodric Bray, who doesn't care about keeping the Majority in the House in D.C., is the primary problem. Soon, he will have a Primary Problem, as will any other politician who supports him in this stupidity,\" Trump warned in a social media post.\n\nDespite pressure from Trump and his political team, Bray, the Republican leader in the state Senate, announced last week that there wasn't enough support in the chamber to move forward with redistricting. Indiana is the latest battlefield in the high-stakes redistricting showdown pitting Trump and Republicans versus Democrats to shape the 2026 midterm landscape in the fight for the House majority.\n\nINDIANA REPUBLICANS REJECT TRUMP-BACKED REDISTRICTING PUSH\n\nRepublicans currently control seven of Indiana's nine congressional districts, and any new map passed by the GOP supermajority in the legislature would likely shift the state's 1st Congressional District from blue-leaning to a red-leaning seat.\n\nTrump on Sunday lambasted Bray and another Republican state senator, calling for their ouster.\n\nThe president returned to social media a day later, charging, \"Because of these two politically correct type 'gentlemen,' and a few others, they could be depriving Republicans of a Majority in the House, A VERY BIG DEAL!\"\n\nRULING BY RED STATE JUDGE REDISTRICTING SETBACK FOR REPUBLICANS\n\nTrump is twisting elbows in his attempt to make Indiana the latest Republican-controlled state to change their congressional maps. The president has called state lawmakers and Vice President JD Vance visited the state earlier this autumn to discuss redistricting.\n\nAnd Fox News has confirmed that Trump has invited some of the Indiana Republicans who are holding out against redistricting to White House meetings in the coming days. The news was first reported by Politico.\n\nTrump, in his Sunday post, also took a jab at Republican Gov. Mike Braun of Indiana, arguing that the governor \"perhaps, is not working the way he should to get the necessary Votes.\"\n\nBraun on Monday wrote on social media that \"I just had a great call with President Trump! I told him I remain committed to standing with him on the critical issue of passing fair maps in Indiana to ensure the MAGA agenda is successful in Congress.\"\n\nAnd the governor claimed that \"the Indiana State Senate is hiding behind closed doors and refusing to even bring redistricting to a vote. Hoosiers deserve to know where their legislators stand and expect them to show up for work, not walk out and hide in the dark.\"\n\nTrump on Tuesday called Braun \"a good man,\" but warned he \"must produce on this, or he will be the only Governor, Republican or Democrat, who didn't.\"\n\nNEWSOM TAKES VICTORY LAP AFTER LANDSLIDE REDISTRICTING VICTORY IN CALIFORNIA\n\nThe push by the president in Indiana is part of a broad effort by Trump's political team and the GOP to pad the party's razor-thin House majority to keep control of the chamber in next year's midterms, when the party in power traditionally faces political headwinds and loses seats.\n\nTrump is aiming to prevent what happened during his first term in the White House when Democrats reclaimed the House majority in the 2018 midterm elections.\n\nTexas, Missouri, North Carolina, and Ohio have drawn new maps as part of the president's push. And Florida and Kansas are also mulling redrawing their maps.\n\n\"We must keep the Majority at all costs,\" Trump wrote Monday.\n\nBut on Tuesday, a three-judge federal panel delivered a blow to Trump and Republicans, by ruling that the state can't use the newly drawn map in next year's elections. Texas Republicans say they'll appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court.\n\nMeanwhile, Democrats are fighting back.\n\nCalifornia voters two weeks ago overwhelmingly passed Proposition 50, a ballot initiative which will temporarily sidetrack the left-leaning state's nonpartisan redistricting commission and return the power to draw the congressional maps to the Democrat-dominated legislature.\n\nThat is expected to result in five more Democratic-leaning congressional districts in California, which would counter the passage earlier this year in Texas of a new map that aims to create up to five right-leaning House seats.\n\nCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIllinois and Maryland, two blue states, and Virginia, where Democrats control the legislature, are also taking steps or seriously considering redistricting.\n\nAnd in a blow to Republicans, a Utah district judge last week rejected a congressional district map drawn up by the state's GOP-dominated legislature and instead approved an alternate that will create a Democratic-leaning district ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.",

        "description": "NEW YORK, Nov 18 (Reuters) - A race is on among energy companies to build a major fuel pipeline to the U.S. West Coast, a potentially lucrative prize as the planned closure of two California refineries threatens to send gasoline prices in the isolated market soaring.\n\nMotorists in West Coast states have long paid some of the country's highest fuel prices due to limited regional production and minimal connectivity to the Gulf Coast refining hub. There are no pipelines delivering fuel to California from across the Rocky Mountains and only a few pipelines deliver to the West Coast from the Gulf Coast, according to the Energy Information Administration.\n\nSign up here.\n\nPhillips 66's Los Angeles plant began winding down operations in September and Valero Energy's Benicia refinery plans to close in April, threatening more price shocks for consumers but presenting an opportunity for pipeline operators.\n\nThree groups have outlined different proposals to fill the near 280,000 barrel-per-day supply void the closures create. These include refiner HF Sinclair, a unit of pipeline operator ONEOK (OKE.N), opens new tab, and a partnership between refiner Phillips 66 (PSX.N), opens new tab and midstream-focused Kinder Morgan (KMI.N), opens new tab.\n\nHowever, the first to reach a final investment decision may be the only one to secure a potential multi-billion-dollar windfall because multiple pipelines to the West Coast would eat into each other's margins, which are already limited due to the availability of waterborne imports to California.\n\n\"When you see multiple pipeline projects being proposed at the same time, typically only one of them gets done,\" said Skip York, chief energy strategist at Turner, Mason & Co.\n\nThe planned refinery closures have put intense pressure on California Governor Gavin Newsom to stop fuel prices from surging, creating a rare window for the approval of a fossil fuel project in a state that has long vilified \"Big Oil\".\n\n\"Given the backlash to refinery closures, it's hard to imagine much resistance to new projects,\" East Daley analyst Alec Gravelle said.\n\nCapacity commitments make up most of the financing required to build pipelines, so securing at least 70% of the proposed projects' capacity could decide which of them progresses, York said.\n\nThat gives Western Gateway - the Phillips 66-Kinder Morgan project - and HF Sinclair's proposal an advantage, as the refiners themselves could guarantee some of the supply, Scotiabank analyst Paul Cheng said.\n\nNone of the proponents have yet announced any capacity commitments. Phillips 66 declined to comment on competing West Coast pipeline proposals. The other proponents did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nProposals reusing existing lines also have a better chance of moving forward than new builds because regulatory approval may be easier, said Debnil Chowdhury, head of Americas and European refining at S&P Global Commodity Insights.\n\nParts of Western Gateway and HF Sinclair's plan propose using existing lines.\n\nWhile a new pipeline could provide some stability to regional gasoline prices, refining executives have questioned whether any will ultimately get built, pointing to California's access to waterborne fuels.\n\n\"In terms of the pipelines that are rumored to come into the region, I would say that's a big if,\" said Rick Hessling, chief commercial officer for Marathon Petroleum, adding the timing and transportation cost of waterborne barrels trumped pipelines.\n\nValero Energy, the second-largest independent refiner, is unlikely to commit to a long-term shipping arrangement with any of the three projects, Chief Operating Officer Gary Simmons said during an investor call last month.\n\n\"We like the waterborne option because it allows you to source barrels from anywhere in the world and take advantage of international arbs that can be open,\" Simmons said, referring to price arbitrage opportunities.\n\nReporting by Nicole Jao and Shariq Khan in New York; Editing by Nia Williams\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles., opens new tab",

        "description": "Chiara Ferragni, a wildly glamorous fashion influencer who still boasts more than 28 million Instagram followers, was once a fixture on the Big Apple fashion scene.\n\nAt New York Fashion Week after New York Fashion Week, she would post pictures of herself sitting front row at coveted catwalk shows, cozying up to Karlie Kloss and \"The Real Housewives of New York\" star Rebecca Minkoff, and using landmarks like the Empire State Building as backdrops in enviable Instagram snaps shared with social media fans.\n\nAnd when she donned a crocheted lace Christian Dior dress to marry Italian rapper Federico Leonardo \"Fedez\" Lucia in 2018, her extravagant wedding at a 19th-century Sicilian palazzo was featured in American Vogue, not to mention observed by a documentary film and reality TV crew.\n\nBut the 38-year-old Italian -- who used her fame to build a fortune in the millions of dollars -- has had a spectacular fall from grace and is now facing five years in prison after being indicted on charges of aggravated fraud in her home country.\n\nShe already appeared at the Court of Milan for pre-trial hearings on Sept. 23 and Nov. 4, with another court appearance set for next Tuesday, Nov. 25.\n\nShe's been fined $1.27 million for conning the public into thinking she was selling Christmas treats for charity when the vast bulk of cash was going straight into her pockets (she paid an extra $1.39 million for a similar scheme over fake claims that Easter eggs would also underwrite a kids' hospital).\n\nThe Italian government went further after those fines, though, charging her with aggravated fraud at a criminal trial this month in Milan. If she's convicted, Ferragni could spend up to five years behind Italian bars.\n\nFerragni has gone from being the darling of Dior, Gucci and Versace, married to a famous rapper and earning up to six figures for a single Instagram post, to divorced, disgraced and seeing her company, Fenice Srl, make a loss of $6.65 million last year.\n\n\"She's the Kim Kardashian of Italy,\" Lauren Beeching, a crisis PR expert who specializes in sticky situations just like this, told The Post. \"She's super glamorous, business-minded and commercially unstoppable. At least until now.\"\n\nHowever, the prospect of a half-decade behind bars has not stopped the mother of two, who -- rather than retreat gracefully until the trial has concluded -- Ferragni instead swanned around fashion weeks this fall as usual, snapping pics and posting with her usual diligence. She also nabbed several glossy magazine covers, including Cosmopolitan Espan\u0303a, Harper's Bazaar Tu\u0308rkiye and Marie Claire Me\u0301xico.\n\nOne fashion week invitation did not make the grid, though -- her September pre-trial hearing.\n\nBut how did it get to this?\n\nIt was in 2009 that Ferragni first became famous for her blogging and bling, showcasing her flashy lifestyle as a student and earning enough attention to drop out of law school to focus on it full-time. Even then, she was canny enough to bleach her mousy brown hair to make her more notable - and fit her nickname.\n\n\"She's the biggest 'It' girl in Italy, literally a household name, and she has a huge walk-in closet with hundreds of Chanel bags,\" says Sophie Ross Brooks, co-host of the influencer-tracking \"Snark Bait\" podcast. \"And they're not even organized, just haphazardly thrown together. It's, like, 'Omigod, she's so rich she doesn't even have to worry about storing her Chanel bags carefully.' \"\n\nThere wasn't any aspect of her life she didn't slavishly document on her Insta page, from her wedding to her two pregnancies, with her children eventually becoming fixtures on her platform.\n\nThrough the couple's earnings, she built up a property portfolio -- including a Milanese penthouse and a country retreat on Lake Como. Amazon Prime Italy tapped her entire family to anchor \"The Ferragnez,\" a hit \"Keeping Up With the Kardashians\"-style show about Chiara and her extended family, including her two lookalike sisters, Valentina and Francesca (the former is actually a natural blond).\n\nIt was all going so well that in 2020, she even considered a personal IPO, allowing fans to quite literally invest in their idol. By the end of 2022, her retail company Fenice Srl -- offering women's clothing, jewelry, kidswear, furniture and more -- was worth around $87.5 million.\n\nThen came #pandorogate -- and a crash so extreme that she's lost nearly 90% of that value.\n\nIt seemed so innocuous: For Christmas 2022, Ferragni announced yet another collab -- this time, with Pillsbury-like baked-goods company Balocco, to sell a special festive cake, or pandoro, for charity.\n\nIt was three times pricier than a regular version, but worth every penny for the do-gooding baked in. All the proceeds, Chiara trilled, would go to support the Regina Margherita Children's Hospital in Turin.\n\nAlmost immediately, Italian media were suspicious and, before the end of the year, had exposed the truth.\n\nBalocco had donated some money to the hospital -- $58,000 -- albeit long before the cake went on sale. As for Chiara, she reportedly pocketed a cool million for her endorsement, or around 20 times what went to those sick kids. (An alleged fraud was repeated around a similar scheme with an Easter egg maker, where only $41,650 of the $1.39 million Chiara and the manufacturer reportedly earned went to charity.)\n\nChiara's always-on Insta went dark as the Italian authorities began investigating. Eventually, she was fined $1.15 million, charged with aggravated fraud, and earned the dubious legacy of a statute change named in her dishonor: the Ferragni Law, which threatens fines on any charitable product that doesn't make clear the exact percentage that will go to a good cause.\n\nShe finally acknowledged her con with a mea culpa Instagram Reel a year later, in December 2024. Almost makeup-free and penitent, she promised a personal donation of another million to the hospital.\n\nSince then, things have gotten worse, not better: She's weathered a messy public divorce -- claiming that Fedez was unfaithful to her throughout their marriage and even offered to leave her at the altar -- and tried to relegate the scandal to history by resuming her once-normal schedule, all while criminal charges loomed over her.\n\nIt doesn't seem to be working.\n\n\"Her approach right now is pretty horrific,\" crisis PR guru Lauren Beeching told The Post. \"I would be pulling her out of the fashion-week circuit and pushing her to do independent audits and charity work. A complete shift in tone to less gloss and more realism.\n\n\"She could start again from the ground up,\" Beeching suggested, which could include a move to another country.\n\nA bigger problem, though, might be money.\n\nOG influencers like Ferragni face an issue that their business model is outdated, at least according to Ryan Berger, who runs The Berger Shop, an influencer marketing shingle.\n\n\"There's been a big change in the influencer space, going from mass to very, very targeted, which is why everyone wants to work with micro-influencers -- they speak directly to their audience and they're trusted.\" Put another way: no brand wants to pay six figures to reach 28 million people but drive few sales when they could shell out $500 to a niche name that will nearly guarantee them.\n\nStateside, there are tighter regulations around influencing, courtesy of the Federal Trade Commission, which already made two-year rules even harsher starting this summer. It increased disclosure requirements, as well as liability for both brands and agencies alongside those content creators, making them all responsible for any infractions. It's as granular as specifying the font size for disclosures at the start of any video (24 points, or the platform equivalent).\n\nAs for Ferragni-like fraud, that's covered under standard statutes, but several states, including California and New York, are agitating for even stricter controls on alleged social media shilling like this. For instance, Golden State Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a law last month that aims to stop scammers from ripping off customers via unlabeled AI deepfakes.\n\nStill, some say that notoriety can be monetized, when handled deftly, even in Ferragni's favorite luxury space.\n\nBarton Consulting's Winston Chesterfield is one of them. He's a guru of that high-end niche and says it can humanize endorsers -- look at Jude Law's messy private life, for example, which didn't preclude him scoring Dior Homme and Brioni deals, among others.\n\n\"It depends on how serious it is, but luxury needs real characters -- it can't rely on models -- so the idea brands don't want to be associated with any kind of controversy? It's not really true,\" he explained. \"Strong women who rise up again like a phoenix from the ashes get rewarded again.\"\n\nIt all depends on how fierce a fire Chiara winds up facing, though.\n\nPerhaps a Martha Stewart-style spell in the clink would be the best outcome for everyone, according to crisis expert Beeching.\n\n\"The influencer world isn't playing by the rules, and they know they can get away with it,\" she told The Post. \"So this might be a bit of a lesson for everyone.\"",

        "title": "California high schools at odds after alleged trans athlete displaces female in cross-country top 10",
        "description": "Ayala High School girls' cross-country coaches Carolina Cobo and Matthew Ullman revealed a recent incident where a trans athlete finished in a top-10 spot in a league final, dropping one of their female athletes out of the top 10.\n\nA junior varsity cross-country meet was the site of a budding dispute between two California high schools over the validity of trans athletes' records in girls' sports.\n\nDuring a league final last week, an alleged trans athlete for Claremont High School finished in fourth place in the JV girls' competition. Meanwhile, a female athlete for Ayala High School had to settle for 11th place, missing out on a podium finish by one spot.\n\nAyala girls' cross-country coach Caroline Cobo told Fox News Digital that she lobbied to have her athlete recognized.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM\n\n\"During the awards, we asked if, when they called the top 10, for each category that they could call up the top 11 for the JV girls' race,\" Cobo said. \"But they said no, they couldn't.\"\n\nSo, Cobo and her team took matters into their own hands.\n\n\"So we decided to stand up during that award ceremony and say, 'Oh, and in 10th place,' which, on paper, she was 11th, but in reality she was the 10th biological female to cross the finish line. We stood up and said that, and she went up,\" Cobo said.\n\nAyala girls' assistant coach Matthew Ullman said he was confronted in the aftermath.\n\n\"While we stood up, lots of eyes on us, obviously. Afterwards we got some thank you's from some parents, some athletes saying 'thank you.' But I got approached by about five or six of the girls from the team where the transgender athlete competes at, and [it was] pretty confrontational,\" Ullman told Fox News Digital.\n\nUllman alleged that the Claremont High School athletes told him, \"'Why did you have to say that?... You didn't have to say biological female,'\" and he claimed he responded, \"'Well, I needed to give credit where credit was due.'\n\n\"I feel like the Claremont team is a little bit fragmented where some people are like more for it, and some people are against it.\"\n\nINSIDE GAVIN NEWSOM'S TRANSGENDER VOLLEYBALL CRISIS\n\nClaremont High School provided a statement to Fox News Digital defending the recognition of only the top 10 finishers, which would include the school's alleged trans athlete. The school cited California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) rules.\n\n\"Claremont High School is a member of the Palomares League, which includes six high schools that collectively follow CIF rules and regulations for athletic competition. The Palomares League rules recognize only the top 10 finishers,\" the statement said.\n\n\"Claremont High School adheres to CIF and Palomares League rules and regulations. We remain committed to ensuring that all student-athletes are treated respectfully and in accordance with agreed-upon procedures.\"\n\nHowever, Ayala High School responded to Fox News Digital, recognizing its 11th-place female finisher as rightfully deserving of top-10 recognition, citing a CIF rules amendment that was instituted for girls' track and field this past spring. Ayala said it is petitioning to have its female athlete recognized.\n\n\"Ayala administration is committed to recognizing the extraordinary hard work of its athletes and celebrating the dedication and commitment they invest in their athletic programs. Mr. John Kunishima, Ayala High School's Assistant Principal of Athletics and Facilities, has petitioned the Palomares League to recognize the 11 top performing athletes who competed in the League's lower-level girls championship competition this past weekend after one of its female athletes was displaced in the standings by a transgender peer,\" read an Ayala High School statement.\n\n\"Recognizing 11 athletes would be consistent with the California Interscholastic Federation - Southern Section's (CIFSS) 2025 decision for female track and field competitors whereby leadership concluded that a duplicate medal would also be awarded to the next closest female athlete in the competition when a transgender student's performance displaces a female athlete in the standings.\n\nCALIFORNIA SPORTS LEAGUE MEETING SEES PARENTS CLASHING OVER TRANS ATHLETES\n\n\"The Palomares League Athletic Directors will convene on November 18th to discuss recognizing the 11 top performing athletes of this weekend's event and we are hopeful that an equitable solution will be achieved. By recognizing 11 outstanding athletes, the Palomares League will not only highlight its commitment to fairness and impartiality, but also its dedication to the students that represent its competing schools.\"\n\nFox News Digital has reached out to the CIF for comment.\n\nThe rule change that Ayala's statement referenced was instituted during the girls' track and field state finals this past spring. The presence of Jurupa Valley's trans athlete AB Hernandez prompted national scrutiny in the days leading up to the event, after President Donald Trump seemingly brought attention to the situation in a Truth Social post, threatening to withhold federal funding from California if a trans athlete was allowed to compete in the girls' state finals.\n\nThe CIF changed its rule to include biologically female athletes that missed out on qualifying for the competition that may have placed higher were it not for a trans athlete's participation and that any female athlete that finished behind a biological male would be bumped up one spot on the podium.\n\nAfter Hernandez won first place in the girls' high jump and triple jump, and second place in the girls' long jump, the trans athlete had to share podium spots with the female athletes who finished one spot lower.\n\n\"CIF's proposed pilot is a reasonable, respectful way to navigate a complex issue without compromising competitive fairness -- a model worth pursuing. The Governor is encouraged by this thoughtful approach,\" he said in a previous statement provided to Fox News Digital.\n\nBut now, Ayala High School finds itself in the midst of a dispute for merely trying to get that same treatment for the JV runner who finished one spot out of the top 10 last week.",

        "title": "Hundreds of National Guard troops deployed to Portland and Chicago are being sent home",
        "description": "Hundreds of National Guard troops deployed to Chicago and Portland, Oregon, are being sent home, and those who will remain will continue to stay off the streets amid court battles over their domestic mission by the Trump administration, a defense official said Monday.\n\nThe withdrawal of soldiers -- sent from California and Texas -- is part of a larger change to troop deployments after President Donald Trump began his immigration crackdown in various cities with Democratic leadership. The official was not authorized to publicly discuss the issue and requested anonymity.\n\nU.S. Northern Command said in a statement Sunday it was \"shifting and/or rightsizing\" units in Portland, Los Angeles and Chicago, although it said there would be a \"constant, enduring, and long-term presence in each city.\"\n\nIn the coming days, all 200 California National Guard troops currently deployed to Portland will be sent home, the official said. The military also plans to cut the number of Oregon National Guard troops on deployment there from 200 soldiers to 100, the official said.\n\nAbout 200 Texas National Guard troops in Chicago also are being sent home and about 200 soldiers will be on standby at Fort Bliss, an Army base that stretches across parts of Texas and New Mexico, the official said.\n\nAbout 300 Illinois National Guard troops will remain in the Chicago area, also doing training, but they currently are not legally allowed to conduct operations with the Department of Homeland Security, the official said.\n\nThe official said the upcoming holiday season may have played a role in the change in deployments.\n\nDiana Crofts-Pelayo, a spokesperson for California Gov. Gavin Newsom, applauded the return of all California National Guard troops in Oregon, saying Trump \"never should have illegally deployed our troops in the first place.\"\n\n\"We're glad they're finally coming home,\" she wrote in an email. \"It's long overdue!\"\n\nOregon Gov. Tina Kotek called on the Trump administration to demobilize the remaining 100 troops in her state, as well.\n\n\"Members of the Oregon National Guard, who are our friends and neighbors, have been away from their families and jobs for 50 days on an unnecessary deployment,\" Kotek said in a written statement. \"With the holidays approaching, every single member deserves to go home.\"\n\nIllinois Gov. JB Pritzker said the Trump administration doesn't communicate its plans with state leaders and was still threatening to federalize more troops.\n\n\"This confirms what we have always known: This is about normalizing military forces in American cities,\" Pritzker spokesman Matt Hill said in a statement Saturday.\n\nHill didn't immediately return a message left Monday.\n\nDemocratic cities targeted by Trump for military involvement -- including Chicago, which filed a separate lawsuit on the issue currently before the U.S. Supreme Court -- have been pushing back. They argue the president has not satisfied the legal threshold for deploying troops and that doing so would violate states' sovereignty.\n\nU.S. District Judge Karin Immergut in Portland this month issued a permanent injunction blocking Trump from deploying troops in the city, saying he had failed to establish that he was legally entitled to do so. On Sunday, the administration filed an emergency motion seeking to put the ruling on hold while it appeals.\n\nSeparately, the Trump administration has stepped up immigration enforcement in Charlotte, North Carolina, expanding an aggressive campaign that's been spearheaded by U.S. Customs and Border Protection.\n\nNational Guard deployments have been one of the most controversial initiatives of Trump's second term, demonstrating an expanded willingness to use the military to accomplish domestic goals.\n\nTroops, including active-duty Marines, were deployed to Los Angeles during immigration protests earlier this year.\n\nThe National Guard was also sent to Washington, D.C., where they were part of a broader federal intervention that Trump claimed was necessary because of crime problems.\n\nThe deployments later expanded to Portland and Chicago.\n\nAlthough they don't play a law enforcement role, members of the National Guard have been tasked with protecting federal facilities, particularly those run by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\nAbout 100 troops who have been in Los Angeles will remain on deployment there, the defense official said.\n\n_____\n\nAP journalists Chris Megerian in Washington, Gene Johnson in Seattle and Sophia Tareen in Chicago contributed to this report.\n\n_____\n\nThis story corrects that all California National Guard troops deployed to Oregon will return and none will remain.",

        "description": "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem responds to the targeting of law enforcement officers on 'Jesse Watters Primetime.'\n\nThe Trump administration filed a lawsuit on Monday challenging California's law banning federal immigration agents from wearing face masks to hide their identities, arguing that the measure is unconstitutional.\n\nThe lawsuit claims that the state does not have the authority to restrict federal agents.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom signed the No Secret Police Act and the No Vigilantes Act into law in September. Under the bills, most law enforcement, including federal agents, would be barred from wearing masks on the job and non-uniformed officers would be required to visibly display identification during their duties.\n\nExceptions to the mask ban would be permitted for undercover agents, for those using medical masks like N95 respirators or as part of tactical gear.\n\nNEWSOM BANS LAW ENFORCEMENT FROM WEARING MASKS, TAUNTS ICE AGENTS: 'WHAT ARE YOU AFRAID OF?'\n\nNewsom said that federal immigration officers would no longer be \"hidden from accountability\" while performing operations in California.\n\n\"That's not the America we've grown up in. And so we are pushing back,\" he said ahead of the bill signings.\n\nFederal agents have conducted immigration raids in Southern California since June, targeting migrant workers at local businesses that sparked protests and the subsequent federal deployment of the National Guard and Marines. During the raids, some federal agents wore masks and hid their identities.\n\nThe administration urged the court to deem the laws a violation of the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution and issue a preliminary injunction blocking California from enforcing the laws.\n\nThe Supremacy Clause establishes that federal law is the \"supreme Law of the Land,\" overriding state law.\n\nCALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE PASSES BILL PROHIBITING LAW ENFORCEMENT FROM WEARING FACE MASKS TO SHIELD IDENTITIES\n\nThe lawsuit also argues that the California laws violate Article 5, Section 301 of the U.S. Code, which says agency heads \"may prescribe regulations for the government of his department [and] the conduct of its employees.\"\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi said on Monday that the California laws \"discriminate against the federal government and are designed to create risk for our agents.\"\n\nAfter Newsom signed the measures, administration officials directed ICE agents to ignore the California laws.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security said on Sept. 22 that it will \"NOT comply with Gavin Newsom's unconstitutional mask ban,\" pointing to an increase in threats towards ICE officers.\n\nThe lawsuit also argues that the California laws \"would recklessly endanger the lives of federal agents and their family members and compromise the operational effectiveness of federal law enforcement activities.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBut supporters of masks for immigration agents say that the use of face coverings generates fear among the public and must be stopped.\n\nNewsom office said that California officials \"will see the [DOJ] in court.\"\n\n\"If the Trump administration cared half as much about public safety as it does about pardoning cop-beaters, violating people's rights, and detaining U.S. citizens and their kids, our communities would be much safer,\" spokesperson Diana Crofts-Pelayo said in a statement to The Hill, referring to President Donald Trump pardoning more than 1,000 people who participated in the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riots.",

Gavin Newsom was declared the Democratic frontrunner to win back the White House in 2028 by a column in Politico on Saturday.\n\nPolitico senior political columnist Jonathan Martin wrote that Newsom has positioned himself over the past two years as the most viable Democratic contender for the presidency.\n\n\"No Democrat has had a better two years than Gavin Newsom and because of it, the California governor -- a national figure since he was a 36-year-old boy mayor -- has claimed a new title: front-runner,\" Martin wrote.\n\nNEWSOM REBUKES WHITE HOUSE DEFENSE OF PRAYER AFTER SHOOTING: KIDS WERE 'LITERALLY PRAYING AS THEY GOT SHOT AT'\n\nMartin argued that Newsom combines traditional political experience with a strong grasp of social media and the ability to connect with younger voters, making him a promising candidate.\n\n\"By the old rules of Democratic nominations, Newsom fits neatly in the tradition of Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama: younger, outsider candidates who could credibly run fresh campaigns against the Washington status quo of both parties while claiming enough insider credentials to reassure party mandarins who care about such things,\" he wrote. \"Newsom is also the best-positioned Democrat according to the new rules of politics -- namely, whether you are or can become famous by breaking through on social media.\"\n\nMartin also noted Newsom's centrist and inclusive stance within the party as another advantage for the governor.\n\nVP VANCE'S CAMP ACCUSES CALIFORNIA GOV.

        "title": "Trump administration sues California over law banning masked federal agents",
        "description": "LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Trump administration filed a lawsuit Monday over California's new laws banning federal agents from wearing masks and requiring them to have identification while conducting operations in the state.\n\nThe federal government has argued the laws threaten the safety of officers who are facing \"unprecedented\" harassment, doxing, and violence and said it will not comply with them.\n\nCalifornia became the first state to ban most law enforcement officers, including federal immigration agents, from covering their faces while conducting official business under a bill that was signed in September by Gov. Gavin Newsom.\n\nThe law prohibits neck gaiters, ski masks and other facial coverings for local and federal officers, including immigration enforcement agents, while they conduct official business. It makes exceptions for undercover agents, protective equipment like N95 respirators or tactical gear, and it does not apply to state police.\n\nNewsom also signed legislation requiring law enforcement to wear clear identification showing their agency and badge number while on the job. The laws require federal law enforcement agencies to issue a mask policy by July 1, 2026, and a visible identification policy by Jan. 1, 2026.\n\n\"California's anti-law enforcement policies discriminate against the federal government and are designed to create risk for our agents. These laws cannot stand,\" U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a press release.\n\nThe lawsuit said there have been multiple incidents where Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers were followed and their families threatened. It cites a case of three women in Los Angeles who are being accused of livestreaming while following an ICE agent home and posting the address on Instagram.\n\n\"Given the personal threats and violence that agents face, federal law enforcement agencies allow their officers to choose whether to wear masks to protect their identities and provide an extra layer of security,\" the lawsuit said.\n\nNewsom has called the practice of masked federal agents arresting people across the state \"dystopian.\"\n\nCritics have raised concerns about the increased role of federal agents in local policing and often unidentified agents conducting immigration enforcement activities.\n\n\"If the Trump administration cared half as much about public safety as it does about pardoning cop-beaters, violating people's rights, and detaining U.S. citizens and their kids, our communities would be much safer,\" a spokesperson for Newsom's office said in a statement.\n\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation issued a memo in October to law enforcement agencies across the country advising officers to clearly identify themselves in the field. It cited several incidents where masked criminals posed as immigration officers robbed and kidnapped victims.\n\nThe federal government also said in its lawsuit that the laws violate the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution, which prohibits states from regulating the federal government. It said the law banning federal officers from wearing masks discriminates against the federal government because it exempts state police.\n\nCalifornia Attorney General Rob Bonta's office said it was reviewing the complaint.\n\n\"It's problematic when Californians can't tell the difference between a law enforcement officer who is charged with protecting them and a criminal who is attempting to cause them harm,\" Bonta's office said in a statement. \"The FBI itself has warned that the practice of ICE agents obscuring their identity has led to a rise in copycats committing crimes, threatening public safety and eroding trust in law enforcement.\"",

        "title": "Hundreds of National Guard troops deployed to Portland, Chicago being sent home",
        "description": "Hundreds of National Guard troops deployed to Chicago and Portland, Oregon, are being sent home, and those who will remain will continue to stay off the streets amid court battles over their domestic mission by the Trump administration, a defense official said Monday.\n\nThe withdrawal of soldiers -- sent from California and Texas -- is part of a larger change to troop deployments after President Trump began his immigration crackdown in various cities with Democratic leadership. The official was not authorized to publicly discuss the issue and requested anonymity.\n\nU.S. Northern Command said in a statement Sunday it was \"shifting and/or rightsizing\" units in Portland, Los Angeles and Chicago, although it said there would be a \"constant, enduring and long-term presence in each city.\"\n\nIn the coming days, 200 California National Guard troops deployed to Oregon will be sent home and about 100 will remain in the Portland area doing training, the official said. The military also plans to cut the number of Oregon National Guard troops on deployment there from 200 soldiers to 100, the official said.\n\nAbout 200 Texas National Guard troops in Chicago are being sent home and about 200 soldiers will be on standby at Fort Bliss, an Army base that stretches across parts of Texas and New Mexico, the official said.\n\nAbout 300 Illinois National Guard troops will remain in the Chicago area, also doing training, but they are not legally allowed to conduct operations with the Department of Homeland Security, the official said.\n\nThe official said the upcoming holiday season may have played a role in the change in deployments.\n\nDiana Crofts-Pelayo, a spokesperson for California Gov. Gavin Newsom, said Mr. Trump \"never should have illegally deployed our troops in the first place.\"\n\n\"We're glad they're finally coming home,\" she wrote in an email. \"It's long overdue!\"\n\nOregon Gov. Tina Kotek's office did not return calls for comment. Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker said the Trump administration doesn't communicate its plans with state leaders and was still threatening to federalize more troops.\n\n\"This confirms what we have always known: This is about normalizing military forces in American cities,\" Pritzker spokesman Matt Hill said in a statement Saturday.\n\nMr. Hill didn't return a message left Monday.\n\nDemocratic cities targeted by Trump for military involvement -- including Chicago, which filed a separate lawsuit on the issue currently before the U.S. Supreme Court -- have been pushing back. They argue the president has not satisfied the legal threshold for deploying troops and that doing so would violate states' sovereignty.\n\nU.S. District Judge Karin Immergut in Portland this month issued a permanent injunction blocking Mr. Trump from deploying troops in the city, saying he had failed to establish that he was legally entitled to do so. On Sunday, the administration filed an emergency motion seeking to put the ruling on hold while it appeals.\n\nNational Guard deployments have been one of the most controversial initiatives of Mr. Trump's second term, demonstrating an expanded willingness to use the military to accomplish domestic goals.\n\nTroops, including active-duty Marines, were deployed to Los Angeles during immigration protests this year.\n\nThe National Guard was also sent to the District, where they were part of a broader federal intervention that Mr. Trump said was necessary because of crime problems in the nation's capital.\n\nThe deployments later expanded to Portland and Chicago.\n\nAlthough they don't play a law enforcement role, members of the National Guard have been tasked with protecting federal facilities, particularly those run by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\nAbout 100 troops who have been in Los Angeles will remain on deployment, the defense official said.",

        "title": "Trump administration sues California for banning federal agents from wearing face coverings",
        "description": "The Department of Justice is suing California over two recently enacted laws that would prohibit federal agents from wearing facial coverings and require them to identify themselves while conducting their duties.\n\nThe lawsuit argues California's laws violate the Constitution's Supremacy Clause, under which federal laws take precedence over state laws. The Trump administration also claims the laws threaten the safety of federal officers.\n\nThe federal government said in court documents it \"does not intend to comply.\"\n\n\"Today we filed a lawsuit to strike down California's unconstitutional law aimed at unmasking the faces of our federal agents, which will allow criminals to dox them,\" Bill Essayli, the top federal prosecutor in Los Angeles, wrote on X. \"Unconstitutional laws such as this one further endanger our brave men and women protecting our community.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Gov. Gavin Newsom criticized the lawsuit in a statement to CBS News.\n\n\"If the Trump administration cared half as much about public safety as it does about pardoning cop-beaters, violating people's rights, and detaining U.S. citizens and their kids, our communities would be much safer,\" spokesperson Diana Crofts-Pelayo wrote. \"We'll see the U.S. Department of Justice in court.\"\n\nIn September, Newsom signed the \"No Secret Police Act\" into law. The measure bans federal, state, and local officials from concealing their identity with face coverings while conducting operations.\n\nThe California Highway Patrol would be exempt, as well as undercover operatives, members of SWAT teams and people who have health issues or who need masks for medical reasons like preventing smoke inhalation.\n\nThe lawsuit against California argues the state is discriminating against federal agents as it exempts some state officials from the mask ban.\n\nNewsom also signed the \"No Vigilantes Act\" in September, which would require non-uniformed federal agents operating in California to visibly display identification that includes their agency and either a name or badge number starting in January.\n\nCalifornia Democratic state senators pushed for the passage of these bills in June, in response to federal agents wearing face coverings while conducting immigration enforcement operations across California.\n\nBoth laws would impose criminal penalties on federal law enforcement officers for noncompliance in some cases.\n\nCritics of the facial covering ban, including the California Association of Highway Patrolmen, argue it would put officers and their families' lives and well-being at risk by prohibiting them from protecting their identity when needed. State-level critics also say it would only serve to punish local law enforcement for the actions of federal agents.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security called on Newsom to veto the bills in September and, upon passage, stated it would not comply.\n\n\"To be clear: We will NOT comply with Gavin Newsom's unconstitutional mask ban,\" DHS posted on X in September that called the law a \"PR stunt.\"\n\nIn June, a federal version of the \"No Secret Police Act\" was introduced by New York Democratic Reps. Dan Goldman and Adriano Espaillat. This act would also ban facial coverings and require law enforcement officers and DHS agents to clearly display identification and insignia when detaining individuals.\n\nCBS News has reached out to California Attorney General Rob Bonta for comment.",

        "title": "Trump Administration Asks Court to Block California Ban on Masked Agents",
        "description": "The Trump administration has filed a lawsuit against Gov. Gavin Newsom, challenging a California law he recently signed that prohibits law enforcement officers from wearing masks, a practice that became common this year amid the president's immigration crackdown.\n\nThe suit claims that the mask ban, and a companion measure requiring federal agents to wear identification, are unconstitutional because states do not have the power to regulate federal agencies. It says federal law enforcement agencies will not comply with the pair of state laws, which take effect on Jan. 1, and asks the court to strike them down.\n\n\"California's anti-law enforcement policies discriminate against the federal government and are designed to create risk for our agents. These laws cannot stand,\" Attorney General Pamela Bondi said in a statement.\n\nSeveral states have introduced measures to ban masking by immigration agents, but California was the first to pass one into law.\n\nThe lawsuit comes as little surprise. Mr. Newsom himself said in July that he was \"looking at the constitutionality\" of the bill, months before signing it in September. Legal experts predicted it would be challenged in court, where numerous conflicts between California and the Trump administration are now playing out.\n\n\"If the Trump administration cared half as much about public safety as it does about pardoning cop-beaters, violating people's rights, and detaining U.S. citizens and their kids, our communities would be much safer,\" Izzy Gardon, a spokesman for Mr. Newsom, said in a statement.\n\nSupporters have argued that the measure is constitutional because state and local governments can require federal agencies to follow general laws, such as speed limits. The mask law applies to both federal and local law enforcement agents in California.\n\nScott Wiener, a Democratic state senator who wrote the bill, vowed to fight to defend it.\n\n\"We see I.C.E. and other federal agents going into communities with these ski masks, just terrorizing communities, where you don't even know if someone is an actual agent or not,\" Mr. Wiener said in a video posted on social media.\n\n\"It causes fear, and it's unacceptable in a democracy.\"\n\nThe lawsuit claims that officers must have the option to shield their identities because of the threats and violence they face on the job. It cites a huge increase in assaults and death threats against officers, and says websites publish agents' personal information \"to harass and threaten them and their families.\"\n\n\"Now is an extraordinarily dangerous time to serve in federal law enforcement,\" the lawsuit said.\n\nIt contends that the California laws prohibiting officers from wearing masks and requiring that they display identification \"would recklessly endanger the lives of federal agents and their family members and compromise the operational effectiveness of federal law enforcement activities.\"\n\nBecause federal agencies will not comply with the laws, officers are at risk of criminal prosecution if the laws are not struck down, the suit says. It points to a statement last month by former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who said local police could arrest federal agents if they break California laws during immigration raids.",

        "description": "The Trump Justice Department filed a lawsuit Monday to stop California's new law that seeks to ban federal immigration officers from wearing masks to conceal their identities, saying the government \"does not intend to comply.\"\n\nTrump officials cast the state law as an illegal attempt to undermine federal immigration enforcement powers, and said it puts agents and their families at risk by exposing their identities to dangerous people.\n\nThe law, signed by Gov. Gavin Newsom and cheered by anti-ICE activists nationwide, is slated to take effect in January.\n\nMr. Newsom, a Democrat, signed another law requiring officers who aren't in uniform to wear some sort of identification, showing them as federal agents.\n\nAttorney General Pamela Bondi called the laws \"anti-enforcement policies.\"\n\n\"Law enforcement officers risk their lives every day to keep Americans safe, and they do not deserve to be doxed or harassed simply for carrying out their duties,\" she said.\n\nThe department, in the lawsuit, said both laws violate the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution by trying to exert control over how federal law enforcement is carried out.\n\nFederal lawyers also said the law is discriminatory since it only applies to federal officers and not to state officers.\n\nThe department said it is announcing federal agents' intention not to comply now, so that it can get a court ruling before the laws take effect on Jan. 1.\n\nAnti-ICE activists have complained that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which is leading much of President Trump's mass deportation effort, has turned into a secret police with its effort to hide agents' identities while scouring communities for illegal immigrant targets to arrest.\n\nActivists have tried to catalog the identities of officers they have been able to identify, leading to some reports of harassment.\n\nHomeland Security says ICE officers have seen a surge in both assaults and death threats aimed at them.\n\nCalifornia's anti-masking law is known as the No Secret Police Act. The law requiring federal officers out of uniform to wear visible identification that denotes their agency or a badge number is called the No Vigilantes Act.\n\nThat's in response to what law enforcement acknowledges has been a notable increase in publicly reported cases of people pretending to be immigration officers.\n\nIn a bulletin last month, the FBI said criminals had been found posing as immigration officers to carry out robberies, kidnappings and sexual assaults.\n\nThe bulletin, reported by Wired, cited five incidents in 2025 and attributed the increase to ICE's higher profile amid Mr. Trump's immigration enforcement push.",

        "description": "USA TODAY Sports' Safid Deen breaks down the latest comments from President Donald Trump regarding FIFA World Cup venues and his concerns over safety.\n\nUnited States President Donald Trump reiterated his threat to move 2026 World Cup matches from cities with Democratic mayors and crime problems during a news conference in conjunction with an Oval Office meeting of the White House's FIFA Task Force on Monday, November 17.\n\nFIFA president Gianni Infantino also did not completely rule out the possibility after a reporter asked Trump about Seattle's new Democratic Socialist mayor-elect Katie Wilson, and whether her agenda and pre-existing crime issues there, could affect the city hosting six World Cup games at Lumen Field next year.\n\nIt prompted Trump to again suggest World Cup matches at United States venues could be changed if the administration is concerned about safety at the game site. He previously said he had the authority to move World Cup games from Boston last month.\n\n\"If we think there's going to be a sign of any trouble, I would ask (Infantino) to move that to a different city,\" Trump said.\n\n\"I don't think we will have this problem, but we will move the event to some place it will be appreciated and safe,\" he added.\n\nTrump also posed the hypothetical question directly to Infantino.\n\nThe FIFA president did not rule out the possibility of having to move a match for safety concerns, though he emphasized early ticket sales suggest fans are not concerned about safety and security at this point.\n\n\"Safety and security are the No. 1 priority for a successful World Cup,\" Infantino said in response. \"We can see today that people have trust in the United States and we see the ticket sales, tickets sold, are record-breaking. Almost 2 million sold already out of 2 million ... because people, they know, they will be coming here and they will experience a safe and secure World Cup. It's of course the responsibility of the government ... and obviously we will, we will discuss, we are working together. We have a Task Force for this and we must ensure that all fans coming from abroad here can experience a celebration of coming together, of the sport, and this goes on with 100% safety.\"\n\nWhen asked a follow-up about the logistics of potentially moving a match and whether there was a deadline to do so, Trump called on local officials hosting World Cup matches to ask for federal help to ensure the safety around the games. He pointed specifically to the state of California and Governor Gavin Newsom. World Cup matches are scheduled to be played at SoFi Stadium outside Los Angeles and Levi's Stadium in the Bay Area next summer.\n\n\"The governors are going to have to behave, the mayors are going to have to behave.\" Trump said \"... I love Los Angeles. If they want help during this, I would love to send in National Guard or whoever is necessary during that. I want it to be great. I would love it to be in Los Angeles. I love the place. It's a natural for Los Angeles. If we think there's going to be crime, if we're obstructed by the Governor - maybe he won't obstruct, maybe he'll be great - but I'd love for him to call and say could I have some extra help.\"\n\n\"Because if there's even a hint of a problem, we want to get in there before the problem occurs,\" Trump continued. \"We want to make it totally safe for ... all of the great people that are going to be there, and I think it's going to happen. I would be honored to help California if they're going to have a problem. ... We can be in there in 24 hours notice.\"",

        "description": "U.S. first lady Melania Trump relays a reporter's question to President Donald Trump. REUTERS/Brian Snyder\n\nAs experts and internet sleuths worked to dissect and decipher the explosive emails released last week by the U.S. House Oversight Committee from estate of deceased sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein referencing President Donald Trump, the White House, reports The Poke, was working hard to change the narrative.\n\n\"Although the claims in the emails remain unsubstantiated, and Donald Trump maintains he had no knowledge of or involvement in Epstein's sex-trafficking or abuse, his messages paint the president in a very bad light,\" they write.\n\n\"One exchange between Jeffrey Epstein and his brother, Mark, particularly grabbed the attention of the internet,\" they explain, referring to an email that went viral referring to Trump performing a sex act on someone named \"Bubba,\" which sent the internet into a frenzy of speculation, with many assuming it meant former President Bill Clinton, whose nickname is, indeed, Bubba.\n\nAnd while Epstein's brother quashed that rumor Sunday, saying it was not in reference to Clinton, the White House social media staff went into damage control mode, hyping the love story between Trump and First Lady Melania instead.\n\n\"With all the subtlety of a bulldozer crashing into the East Wing, the White House went straight to damage-limitation mode with this display of the world's most unpopular - and unconvincing - lovebirds,\" The Poke writes.\n\nThe official White House X account posted a picture of the couple with the lyrics, \"I can't help falling in love with you,\" and, The Poke says, \"In case anyone hadn't got the message ...they had a back-up photo\" -- a picture of them holding hands with the caption, America's power couple.\"\n\nDespite that, the message got through indeed, but it failed miserably, The Poke notes.\n\n\"As calming measures go, it was a complete failure. The guffaws could be heard on both sides of the Atlantic,\" they write.\n\n\"Nothing says soulmates like air kissing your spouse as if he's the senile drunk uncle you have to put up with every Thanksgiving,\" posted liberal influencer Jo Jo From Jerz on X.\n\nGovernor Gavin Newsom (D-CA) used no words in his post on X, instead reposting the 'power couple' post with a picture of Trump and Epstein.\n\nMissouri Democratic congressional candidate Fred Wellman posted on X, \"Hahahahaha. You can actually smell the flop sweat from that building here in Missouri. Tick tock.\"\n\nAuthor and activist Brooklyn Dad Defiant wrote on X, \"LMAO, you clowns are ridiculous. You think everybody has a room temperature IQ, and that nobody has paid attention to the fact that Melania can't stand to be touched by the guy. That she doesn't even live with him. She designed a hat so that his lips couldn't reach her face. The guy almost never posts Happy Birthday or Happy Anniversary to her. Biggest sham marriage ever.

        "title": "Trump threatens World Cup host cities over 'safety' concerns as White House announces visa scheme for fans",
        "description": "FIFA secured a concession from the White House as President Donald Trump announced that match ticket-holders for next summer's World Cup will have access to advanced appointments for tourist visas at U.S. overseas consulates - but FIFA's respite was short-lived as Trump warned host cities including Seattle and Los Angeles may be in danger of having their games relocated due to \"safety\" concerns.\n\nIn an extraordinary conference alongside FIFA President Gianni Infantino in the Oval Office, in which the World Cup trophy took pride of place, Trump also said he would be prepared to launch \"strikes\" on 2026 World Cup co-hosts Mexico due to concerns about drug trafficking.\n\nTrump and Infantino were joined by Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem.\n\nThe event was principally called to announce the new FIFA Priority Appointment Scheduling System (FIFA Pass) but Trump press conferences inevitably end up in different places and this one also encompassed the Epstein files and U.S.-Venezuela relations.\n\nOne of the major concerns for FIFA's government affairs team in the lead-up to the World Cup has been troublingly long wait times for visa appointments at U.S. consulates around the world. This threatens to impact fans of nations who have already qualified for the World Cup.\n\nAs an example, the current wait time for an appointment in Bogota (Colombia) is 11 months, while Quito (Ecuador) is 9.5 months and Casablanca (Morocco) is 6.5 months.\n\nFor some of the nations competing in the tournament, including many in Europe, as well as Japan, South Korea and Australia, access should be easier as they are part of a visa waiver program -- ESTA -- to enter the U.S. This system means citizens of these countries can travel without obtaining a visa, so long as their trip for tourism or business does not exceed 90 days; however, those traveling from many possible contending nations for the World Cup do require visas. This includes Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, Colombia and Uruguay, among many other Latin American nations, as well as large swathes of the Middle East and Africa.\n\nThe State Department has previously succeeded in reducing extremely long wait times in Argentina and Brazil. The cause was helped by $50million set aside \"to reduce passport backlogs and reduce visa wait times\" in a bill signed into law by President Biden in March 2024.\n\nAt the World Cup in Qatar, visitors were able to expedite their entry into the gulf state by applying for a Hayya card, which was effectively a fan pass for World Cup ticket-holders that doubled up as the visa for the tournament.\n\nThe newly announced FIFA PASS for the U.S. does not equate to this. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated: \"The United States is offering prioritized appointments so FIFA World Cup fans can complete their visa interviews and show they qualify.\"\n\nHe warned \"a ticket is not a visa and it doesn't guarantee admission to the U.S.\" but said those who apply with a ticket could get an interview within \"six to eight weeks\".\n\nHowever, applicants will still be subject to the same level of stringent vetting, questioning and security clearances as any other individuals seeking to enter the country. The Athletic has reported previously that the U.S. government, even under President Biden, had been loathe to make any more concessions for FIFA, and officials, speaking anonymously because they were not authorized to talk publicly, had pointed out it was unrealistic to expect the U.S. to follow the lead of countries such as Qatar or Russia, because, they argued, those countries are not deemed globally to be desirable places for people to seek permanent residence.\n\nRegardless, it marked a concession of sorts for FIFA and a possible good news story for Infantino. Yet as the news conference developed, questions were opened to the media.\n\nTrump was asked about the new mayor-elect of Seattle, Katie Wilson, who is a democratic socialist. He was asked how closely he will be watching crime in the city.\n\nTrump said: \"If we think - and I will have to speak to Gianni about this - the Mayor of L.A. is incompetent, everyone knows it...If we didn't go in early on, not only would you have had the fires but you would have had total insurrection in Los Angeles. If we didn't go in, (the police) said we could not have done it without the federal government.\n\n\"We did a great job. If we think there is going to be a sign of any trouble, I would ask Gianni to move that to a different city. We have a lot of cities who would love to have it and would do it very safely. If we think there is a problem in Seattle, where there is a liberal, communist mayor... I watched her over the weekend, wow that is another 'beauty' we have got there. Gianni, can I say we will move the event to some place it will be appreciated and safe?\"\n\nInfantino answered: \"Safety and security is the number one security for a succesful World Cup. We can see people have trust in the United States because we have record-breaking ticket sales. Tickets are almost two million sold already. People know they will be coming here to experience a safe and secure World Cup. This of course is the responsibility of the government and obviously we will discuss, we are working together, we must ensure all fans coming from abroad can experience a celebration of coming together of the sport and with 100 percent safety.\"\n\nTrump was then asked if he had a timeline for relocations in mind given tickets are already on sale and host cities are selling sponsorship packages and any moves will impact local businesses.\n\n\"The governors and mayors are going to have to behave,\" he replied. \"In California, you have a problem. You have high crime and a place that just suffered great fires...so here is the story, I love Los Angeles. If they want help during this, I would love to send in the National Guard or whoever is necessary. I want it to be great. I love Los Angeles. I love the place.\n\n\"If we think there is going to be crime, if we are obstructed by the Governor (Gavin Newsom) - maybe he won't obstruct us - I would love for him to call and say we would like help. If there is even a hint of a problem, we want to get in there before a problem occurs. We want it totally safe for Gianni and FIFA. I would be honored to help California. We can be there in 24 hours and do a great job.\"\n\nAsked for the message he would send to local businesses, Trump said: \"Tell your governor to ask for federal help. We would love to help them.\"\n\nTrump was then asked if he would launch strikes or place troops in Mexico.\n\nHe said: \"Would I launch strikes in Mexico to stop drugs? Okay with me. Whatever we have to do to stop drugs. Mexico is - look, I looked at Mexico City over the weekend, there's some big problems over there.\n\n\"If we had to, would we do there what we've done to the waterways? You know, there's almost no drugs coming into our waterways anymore.\"\n\nAsked if he would get Mexico's permission, he said: \"I've been speaking to Mexico. They know how I stand. We're losing hundreds of 1000s of people to drugs. So now we've stopped the waterways, but we know every route.\n\n\"We know the addresses of every drug lord. We know their address. We know their front door. We know everything about every one of them. They're killing our people. That's like a war. Would I do it? I'd be proud to. I'd probably go into Congress and say, 'Hey' - and you know what? The Democrats and the Republicans would both agree, unless they're crazy, and they are a little crazy on the Democrat side. But we have lost hundreds of 1000s of people a year - death, and that's not talking about family destruction. T\n\n\"hat's talking about death, and much of it comes through Mexico. So let me just put it this way. I am not happy with Mexico. OK? Thank you very much.\"\n\nEarlier this month, FIFA announced that Infantino will present the inaugural 'FIFA Peace Prize', which Trump is likely to recieve, at the World Cup draw on December 5 in Washington D.C. The award is designed to acknowledge \"individuals who have helped to unite people all over the world in peace\", football's world governing body said.\n\nThe World Cup, co-hosted by Canada, Mexico and the United States, will begin on June 11, 2026.",

        "title": "Gavin Newsom preens in Brazil  --  while California drowns at home",
        "description": "Gov. Gavin Newsom is prancing around abroad while Californians suffer through a natural disaster -- and not for the first time.\n\nThe well-coiffed presidential hopeful has a habit of being out of the state during major storms.\n\nIn 2023, he left during a deadly blizzard for a vacation in Mexico. While residents of California's high country were trapped in their homes, Newsom was sunning himself on a beach in Baja on a \"personal trip\" he wouldn't cancel.\n\nThis time, Newsom is away at the 2025 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Brazil, hobnobbing with foreign leaders.\n\nHis goal: to pose as president for a week, attacking the Trump administration for its absence while signing toothless agreements to save the planet.\n\nOn Saturday, as Californians were evacuating their homes and dodging \"catastrophic\" flash floods, Newsom was posting excitedly on X about meeting the vice mayor of Rio de Janeiro.\n\nIt's not that he was unaware of the danger: His official \"CAGovernor\" account reposted several warnings from federal, state and local government agencies back home about the imminent danger posed by the storm.\n\nThese posts alternated with videos of Newsom hiking into the Amazon to visit an indigenous community, and to see a 15-story weather-monitoring tower.\n\nApparently, Newsom cares less about the weather at home than the weather in the rainforest.\n\nNot that he cares about the rainforest all that much.\n\nAs Newsom lamented the Brazilian ecosystem's destruction, his own policies have accelerated it.\n\nCalifornia imports more oil from Brazil -- 20% of its total supply -- than from any country other than Iraq.\n\nThat's because Newsom and his Democrats have restricted production in oil-rich California.\n\nWhile pretending to eliminate fossil fuels, California has become more dependent on foreign oil, including offshore oil in Brazil, where drilling will soon begin near the mouth of the Amazon..\n\nThat is just one example of California's climate hypocrisy.\n\nNewsom and his party have dragged their feet in clearing brush from state land, and have prevented the logging industry from doing so -- again, supposedly to save the planet.\n\nThe result: massive wildfires that, in just one year, erased all of the emissions gains from nearly two decades of \"green\" policies in the state.\n\nThe recent Palisades Fire began on state land, partly due to Newsom's environmentalist extremism.\n\nNewsom has another explanation: the Palisades Fire, he told a gathering in Brazil, was due to climate change.\n\n\"We're on the tip of the spear of climate change,\" he said. \"Simultaneous droughts and simultaneous floods.\"\n\nThat is a shift from Newsom's other recent explanation, when faced with a lawsuit from devastated residents: He blamed the arsonist who allegedly started a New Year's Day blaze that reignited as the Palisades Fire in high winds on Jan. 7.\n\nAt the time, Newsom claimed that he had pre-deployed firefighting resources across Southern California in anticipation of the danger.\n\nBut he did not send crews to the site of the New Year's Day fire, where the danger was most acute -- and where state land was involved.\n\nNewsom did not make sure the state's emergency response was prepared for the worst, his most important responsibility as governor.\n\nAnd with these latest storms, Newsom is literally phoning it in from Brazil.\n\nNewsom has attacked Republicans -- often -- for leaving their states during disasters.\n\nOne of his favorite targets is Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, who was infamously caught leaving his state for Canc\u00fan, Mexico, during a deadly winter freeze.\n\n\"To be fair, he knows a lot about fleeing,\" the governor posted in August, above a photo of Cruz at the airport.\n\nWith that history in mind, Newsom ought to have been on the first flight home to California to lead the storm response.\n\nBut no -- as of Sunday, Newsom was still in Brazil.\n\nHe stayed because he knows the media -- especially in California -- will never apply the same standards to him as it does to Republicans.\n\nAnd he stayed because he is betting that Democratic presidential primary voters care less about a candidate's performance than about how hard he or she fought Donald Trump.\n\nIt's why Newsom has put $40 billion in fire aid at risk by attacking the president instead of working with him.\n\nClimate change is also a useful excuse for Newsom and for other Democrats to shirk basic governing responsibilities.\n\nIf fires and floods threaten California communities, that's because of fossil fuels and the nasty Republicans who support them -- not because Democrats have refused to clear the brush or to build new dams.\n\nIf no one is in charge during disasters, forcing residents to face danger alone, so much the better: Disaster drives home the climate-hysteria point.\n\nNewsom's goal in Brazil goes beyond typical green ideology: He is pursuing his own personal political ambitions.\n\nFresh from his Proposition 50 victory, he wants the \"B-roll\" footage for future presidential campaign ads, showing him pressing the flesh on the world stage.\n\nIf Californians have to endure torrential rainfall, flash floods and mudslides on their own, so be it.\n\nAfter all, he has bigger, global problems to solve on his way to the Democratic nomination.",

        "title": "Ezra Klein's private briefing with Senate Dems raises internal...",
        "description": "Ezra Klein's appearance at a private retreat for Senate Democrats earlier this year triggered internal concerns at the New York Times over whether the star columnist was edging too close to partisan politics, according to a report.\n\nSources familiar with the situation told Axios that concerns were raised within the newspaper -- which has \"typically has frowned on such actions by its journalists, even opinion columnists,\" Axios reported -- following his remarks at the one-day retreat in Mount Vernon, Va., in May.\n\nHe reportedly gave lawmakers a private briefing shortly after the release of his bestselling book \"Abundance,\" which \"challenges liberals to create a more dynamic and prosperous society by cutting regulations and embracing new technologies,\" as Axios put it.\n\nKlein's invite to the retreat came as he's gained influence among both lefty audiences and progressive officeholders -- many of whom view the policy proposals in \"Abundance\" as a blueprint to recapture the White House and Congress.\n\nAsked for comment, Times spokesperson Danielle Rhoades said, \"Ezra is a tremendous talent.\"\n\n\"He talks to people across the ideological spectrum; it's essential for his reporting to have those conversations, and he approaches them as a journalist,\" she added. \"All of this makes him an ideal opinion columnist and host.\"\n\nKlein's podcast, which draws up to 500,000 monthly listeners, is consistently ranked among the most listened-to programs on digital platforms including Spotify and Apple Podcasts.\n\nHis columns are among the Gray Lady's most-clicked pieces, according to internal data cited by Axios.\n\nKlein's rising stardom has reportedly endeared himself to superiors including Sam Dolnick, the newspaper's deputy managing editor and fifth-generation member of the Ochs-Sulzberger family that has controlled the Times for nearly 130 years.\n\nJill Abramson, the Times's former executive editor, told Axios she didn't see a conflict of interest in Klein's talk at the Virginia retreat.\n\n\"It's true that this is a blurry line between journalism and politics and governing,\" she told the news site.\n\n\"But he's in the opinion category and not covering news -- that's a little blurry itself.\"\n\nKlein's increasing influence among powerful Dems -- including potential 2028 presidential candidates -- has raised eyebrows in the party, according to Axios.\n\nHe has met privately with the likes of former Vice President Kamala Harris, Maryland Gov. Wes Moore and California Gov. Gavin Newsom.\n\nKlein is also said to have held court with Josh Shapiro, the Pennsylvania governor who is reportedly interested in appearing on his podcast, according to Axios.\n\nSome Democrats are said to be concerned about Klein's increasing influence in the party given the fact that it is looking to woo working class voters who have defected to the Republicans in recent elections.\n\n\"You're telling me this man who sits in a f-king West Elm-decorated office is going to be the thought leader for Democrats?\" one Democratic aide to a potential presidential candidate told Axios.\n\nThe Post has sought comment from Harris, Moore, Newsom and Shapiro.",

        "description": "A bipartisan super PAC launched by a slew of artificial intelligence leaders has picked its first target: a Democratic congressional candidate who helped lead an effort to put safety measures on the AI industry.\n\nAlex Bores, a New York State Assemblymember, has pushed \"ideological and politically motivated legislation\" that would \"handcuff\" the nation's edge on AI, the heads of the \"Leading the Future\" PAC said in a statement Monday morning.\n\nBores, who is running to represent New York's 12th Congressional District, co-sponsored the RAISE Act, a New York state-level bill that requires the largest AI companies to publish safety protocols for serious misuse use of their tech, such as creating biological weapons or carrying out other criminal activity.\n\nThe legislation, short for \"Responsible AI Safety and Education,\" also forces companies to disclose serious incidents, or else face civil penalties from the state attorney general.\n\nThe bill passed in the state assembly and senate months ago, but New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, a Democrat who has touted AI investments in the Empire State, has yet to sign it into law.\n\nBores and the bill's other co-sponsor in the assembly, Andrew Gounardes, maintain that the RAISE Act has been crafted not to stifle innovation in the fast-moving AI sector. A controversial bill in California to erect safety guardrails on AI was vetoed by Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom in September amid concerns that it would create a chilling effect on the industry.\n\nLeading the Future, which launched over the summer with more than $100 million in backing, insists that the RAISE Act poses the same threat.\n\n\"The RAISE Act is a clear example of the patchwork, uninformed, and bureaucratic state laws that would slow American progress and open the door for China to win the global race for AI leadership,\" the PAC's leaders, political strategists Zac Moffatt and Josh Vlasto, said in their statement.\n\n\"America needs one clear and consistent national regulatory framework for AI that strengthens our economy, creates jobs for American workers, supports vibrant communities, and protects users,\" they said.\n\n\"Bills like the RAISE Act threaten American competitiveness, limit economic growth, leave users exposed to foreign influence and manipulation, and undermine our national security.\"\n\nBores, in a statement to CNBC, fired back: \"I am someone with a master's in computer science, two patents, and nearly a decade working in tech. If they are scared of people who understand their business regulating their business, they are telling on themselves.\"\n\nLater Monday morning, Bores turned the super PAC's attack into a fundraising opportunity for his congressional primary campaign.\n\n\"If you don't want Trump mega-donors writing all tech policy, contribute to help us pushback,\" he wrote on X.",

        "description": "'The Big Weekend Show' panel discuss California Gov. Gavin Newsom's victory lap after the state passed Prop 50, which is expected to add more Democratic representation.\n\nPresident Donald Trump is turning up the heat on Indiana Republicans who have been resisting political pressure from the president to move forward with congressional redistricting.\n\nTrump on Monday, for a second straight day, vowed to back primary challenges against state Republican lawmakers in the solidly red Midwestern state who didn't support his push to draw new maps in Indiana, which would create another GOP-leaning congressional district.\n\n\"I will be strongly endorsing against any State Senator or House member from the Great State of Indiana that votes against the Republican Party, and our Nation, by not allowing for Redistricting for Congressional seats in the United States House of Representatives,\" Trump wrote in a social media post.\n\nIndiana is the latest battlefield in the high-stakes redistricting showdown pitting Trump and Republicans versus Democrats to shape the 2026 midterm landscape in the fight for the House majority.\n\nINDIANA REPUBLICANS REJECT TRUMP-BACKED REDISTRICTING PUSH\n\nRepublicans currently control seven of Indiana's nine congressional districts, and any new map passed by the GOP supermajority in the legislature would likely shift the state's 1st Congressional District from blue-leaning to a red-leaning seat.\n\nDespite pressure from Trump and his political team, Indiana Republican Senate leader Rodric Bray announced last week that there wasn't enough support in the chamber to move forward with redistricting.\n\nTrump on Sunday lambasted Bray and another Republican state senator, calling for their ouster.\n\n\"Because of these two politically correct type 'gentlemen,' and a few others, they could be depriving Republicans of a Majority in the House, A VERY BIG DEAL!\" the president charged.\n\nRULING BY RED STATE JUDGE REDISTRICTING SETBACK FOR REPUBLICANS\n\nTrump is twisting elbows in his attempt to make Indiana the latest Republican-controlled state to change their congressional maps. The president has called state lawmakers and Vice President JD Vance visited the state earlier this autumn to discuss redistricting.\n\nAnd Fox News has confirmed that Trump has invited some of the Indiana Republicans who are holding out against redistricting to White House meetings in the coming days. The news was first reported by Politico.\n\nTrump, in his Sunday post, also took a jab at Republican Gov. Mike Braun of Indiana, arguing that the governor \"perhaps, is not working the way he should to get the necessary Votes.\"\n\nBraun on Monday wrote on social media that \"I just had a great call with President Trump! I told him I remain committed to standing with him on the critical issue of passing fair maps in Indiana to ensure the MAGA agenda is successful in Congress.\"\n\nAnd the governor claimed that \"the Indiana State Senate is hiding behind closed doors and refusing to even bring redistricting to a vote. Hoosiers deserve to know where their legislators stand and expect them to show up for work, not walk out and hide in the dark.\"\n\nNEWSOM TAKES VICTORY LAP AFTER LANDSLIDE REDISTRICTING VICTORY IN CALIFORNIA\n\nThe push by the president in Indiana is part of a broad effort by Trump's political team and the GOP to pad the party's razor-thin House majority to keep control of the chamber in next year's midterms, when the party in power traditionally faces political headwinds and loses seats.\n\nTrump is aiming to prevent what happened during his first term in the White House when Democrats reclaimed the House majority in the 2018 midterm elections.\n\nTexas, Missouri, North Carolina, and Ohio have drawn new maps as part of the president's push. And Florida and Kansas are also mulling redrawing their maps.\n\n\"We must keep the Majority at all costs,\" Trump wrote Monday.\n\nBut Democrats are fighting back.\n\nCalifornia voters two weeks ago overwhelmingly passed Proposition 50, a ballot initiative which will temporarily sidetrack the left-leaning state's nonpartisan redistricting commission and return the power to draw the congressional maps to the Democrat-dominated legislature.\n\nThat is expected to result in five more Democratic-leaning congressional districts in California, which would counter the passage earlier this year in Texas of a new map that aims to create up to five right-leaning House seats.\n\nCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIllinois and Maryland, two blue states, and Virginia, where Democrats control the legislature, are also taking steps or seriously considering redistricting.\n\nAnd in a blow to Republicans, a Utah district judge last week rejected a congressional district map drawn up by the state's GOP-dominated legislature and instead approved an alternate that will create a Democratic-leaning district ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.",

        "title": "Opinion | California's wealth-tax test",
        "description": "California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) in Brazil last week for the COP30 U.N. Climate Summit. (Fernando Llano/AP)\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom has been trying to position himself as the leader of a listless Democratic Party ahead of his likely presidential run. He's had some success energizing the base, but will the ambitious governor survive standing up to what could be his state's greatest act of economic self-sabotage in recent history?\n\nA health care workers' union recently proposed a referendum that would impose a 5 percent wealth tax on billionaires living in California. Its supporters will soon begin collecting the nearly 875,000 signatures they need to get on the ballot in time for next year's midterm election.\n\nThis would only be a one-time hit on the entirety of any given billionaire's assets to fund health care spending, insists the Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West. The levy would hit those who were California residents on Jan. 1, 2026, based on their wealth as of Dec. 31, 2026. They would have five years to pay and better hope that their wealth, which can be fickle for paper billionaires, remains high enough to come up with the cash. No matter what their advocates promise, taxes are rarely ever one-off.\n\nThe group believes this could raise about $100 billion. But there's reason to doubt those revenue projections, which have often been inaccurate in countries that imposed wealth taxes. There are about 255 billionaires in California now, and it's unclear how many count as state residents.\n\nSet aside the legal challenges that would inevitably follow and could prevent the tax from ever being levied. The most likely result is that billionaires would flee, so the state would also lose non-wealth-tax revenue. The risk of the measure passing might even cause some billionaires to leave, just in case. This initiative seems almost tailor-made to drive most Silicon Valley tech companies to Austin, Texas.\n\nNo doubt, Newsom understands the state probably wouldn't recover from such an event, which is why he opposes the measure. His allies have already launched a political action committee to fight it. This sets him apart from Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Massachusetts), whose proposal for a 2 percent wealth tax was a centerpiece of her 2020 campaign.\n\nSupporters of the initiative say that it will pursue all wealth, from art collections to closely-held companies. Income, which is relatively easy to measure, already requires massive bureaucracy to police. Including all kinds of exquisite property will lead to state workers spending countless hours guessing how much racehorses and fine wine collections are worth.\n\nThere are many other good reasons why only four countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development currently have wealth taxes, down from a dozen in the 1990s. A complex tax code means a corrupt one. Sweden's wealth tax, which stood at 1.5 percent before its repeal in 2007, discriminated between different kinds of assets. Either California's wealthy would lobby for their investments to get favorable treatment, or politicians would decide on a whim what they think should be left alone. Either approach would inevitably distort investment decisions and make the economy less productive.\n\nThere are plenty of policy failures in California, where high taxes and unaffordability have caused hundreds of thousands to flee the state. Yet Newsom, governor since 2019, is running on his record -- which is why he doesn't want to own the devastating consequences of a wealth tax. More interesting than his electoral calculation, however, is what policy and moral arguments he uses against the tax. His approach, and how voters respond, will speak volumes about the state of Democratic Party as it seeks its way out of the political wilderness.",

        "description": "Food assistance benefits halt Nov. 1 due to the government shutdown, prompting National Guard aid at LA food banks.\n\nWASHINGTON -- The Pentagon is withdrawing some National Guard troops from Chicago and Portland, Oregon, weeks after President Donald Trump deployed them to combat what he described as increased crime, two U.S. defense officials familiar with the decision said on Sunday, Nov. 16.\n\nOne of the officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said 200 California National Guard troops who were sent to Portland and 200 Texas National Guard members sent to Chicago would return to their home states as soon as Nov. 16.\n\nA spokesperson for California Gov. Gavin Newsom said the Defense Department has told the state that its National Guard members will start returning from Oregon. \"We're glad they're finally coming home. It's long overdue,\" Newsom's spokesperson said.\n\nThe Trump administration sent the troops to Chicago and Portland last month, saying they were needed to support domestic immigration enforcement personnel who were being confronted by activists and protesters.\n\nBut the troops never joined immigration operations in those cities because of lawsuits challenging their deployment.\n\nThe Pentagon and a spokesperson for Oregon's governor did not immediately respond to requests for comments. A spokesperson for Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker said the state had not heard from the federal government about a withdrawal of troops.\n\n\"In the coming days, the Department will be shifting and/or rightsizing our Title 10 footprint in Portland, Los Angeles, and Chicago to ensure a constant, enduring, and long-term presence in each city,\" the U.S. Northern Command posted on X on Friday.\n\n\"Our troops in each city (and others) are trained and ready, and will be employed whenever needed to support law enforcement and keep our citizens safe.\"\n\nTrump, a Republican, has also deployed the National Guard to other Democratic-led cities, including Los Angeles, Memphis, Tennessee, and Washington, D.C.\n\nThe deployments were criticized by Democrats who sued to block them, and the U.S. Supreme Court is expected to decide whether Trump's actions are lawful.\n\n(Reporting by Idrees Ali and Jasper Ward; Editing by Sergio Non, Alex Richardson, and Paul Simao)",

        "description": "Some 200 California National Guard troops who were sent to Portland and another 200 Texas National Guard members who were sent to Chicago will return to their home states beginning as early as Sunday, said the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the deployments.\n\nThe federalized Guard troops arrived in those cities in early October but never deployed into the streets to assist federal law enforcement personnel and protect federal buildings, as the Trump administration envisioned, because of legal challenges that continue to play out in the courts.\n\nWith Thanksgiving and Christmas fast approaching and federal court orders putting a hold on the operational deployment of the Guard, top Pentagon officials decided last week to withdraw the out-of-state soldiers, at least for now, rather than have them continue to sit in a costly limbo separated from their families during the holiday season, one U.S. official said.\n\nAbout 300 Illinois National Guard troops will remain activated in the Chicago area, as will about 200 soldiers from the Oregon National Guard in the Portland area, the officials said.\n\nThe Pentagon has not formally announced the impending Guard withdrawals, which were reported earlier by ABC News, but the military's Northern Command indicated late on Friday that changes to the federalized troop mission in those cities were imminent.\n\nThe command offered no details, however, when it posted on social media that \"in the coming days, the Department will be shifting and/or rightsizing our Title 10 footprint in Portland, Los Angeles, and Chicago to ensure a constant, enduring, and long-term presence in each city.\"\n\nThe Texas and California Guard members had been activated on federal orders by Mr. Trump in early October and placed on active-duty status according to Title 10 of the U.S. Code. \"Our troops in each city (and others) are trained and ready, and will be employed whenever needed to support law enforcement and keep our citizens safe,\" Northern Command said in its statement on Friday.\n\nOregon officials were not immediately available for comment on the Pentagon's decision. A federal judge in Portland earlier this month issued a permanent block on troop deployments to the city in response to demonstrations against Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\nMatt Hill, a spokesman for Gov. JB Pritzker of Illinois, said state officials had not yet been notified of the Pentagon's action.\n\n\"While there are reports the Texas guard is leaving, the Trump Administration is also saying they will keep federalizing national guards to 'ensure a constant, enduring, and long-term presence' in cities,\" Mr. Hill posted on social media. \"Illinois will continue fighting for our state sovereignty, protecting people's rights, and keeping our communities peaceful.\"\n\nA federal judge in Illinois issued a temporary restraining order last month blocking the Trump administration's deployment of National Guard troops in the Chicago area. An appeals panel later upheld the lower-court judge's decision and the U.S. Supreme Court is now weighing the issue.\n\nIn California, officials in the office of Gov. Gavin Newsom, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the federal deployment, said Northern Command had notified them that it would begin drawing down the California National Guard from Portland as early as Sunday.\n\nA spokesman for the governor, Izzy Gardon, applauded the decision, but also condemned the deployment, which has gone on since June and has been authorized to extend into next year. Last week, California asked the federal court again to halt the deployment in that state and release the remaining 300 federalized California National Guard troops.\n\nThe president \"never should have illegally deployed our troops in the first place,\" Mr. Gardon said. \"We're glad they're finally coming home. It's long overdue.\"\n\nShawn Hubler, Mitch Smith and Anna Griffin contributed reporting.",

        "title": "California yanks illegal immigrants' trucker's licenses; Newsom says migrant status not a factor",
        "description": "California has moved to cancel licenses of 17,000 commercial drivers after a back-and-forth with the Trump administration, which is pushing to get what it calls \"dangerous foreign drivers\" off U.S. roads.\n\nTransportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced the cancellations last week, saying California had finally bowed to pressure to kick people the feds say are illegal immigrants off the roads.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom's office acknowledged the revocations but rejected the claim that they were illegal immigrants. It said they were booted because of \"inconsistency\" with state law.\n\n\"After weeks of claiming they did nothing wrong, Gavin Newsom and California have been caught red-handed. Now that we've exposed their lies, 17,000 illegally issued trucking licenses are being revoked,\" Mr. Duffy said.\n\nMr. Newsom's office, for its part, mocked Mr. Duffy for his role on MTV's reality TV show \"Road Rules\" in the 1990s and said he was \"spreading easily disproven falsehoods in a sad and desperate attempt to please his 'dear leader.'\"\n\nAs that back-and-forth was playing out, however, a federal appeals court put a hold on Mr. Duffy's new regulation aimed at stripping illegal immigrants and other \"non-domiciled\" foreign drivers off the road.\n\nThe U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, in a 2-1 ruling, said Mr. Duffy cut too many corners in issuing the rule -- and said the foreign drivers at issue are actually safer than other commercial drivers.\n\nThey also said the migrants themselves, as well as the economy, have come to rely on the migrant drivers and taking them off the road \"would have public safety by forcing it to replace safer experienced drivers with less-safe new drivers.\"\n\nU.S. Circuit Judge Karen Henderson, a George H.W. Bush appointee, dissented, saying she thought the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration made a good showing of the need for the rule, which she said should have been good enough at this point in the litigation.\n\nThe rule at issue limited states' ability to issue commercial driver's licenses to people whose addresses were foreign domiciles but who live in the U.S.\n\nThe government said those drivers fell into a loophole.\n\nBecause much of their driving history exists in their home countries, states struggle to make determinations on whether they should be granted licenses.\n\nJudge Henderson said that made sense, and it was an error for the court to substitute its judgment for the government.\n\n\"It should go without saying that our nation's roadways are safer the fewer people there are operating eighteen-wheelers, buses and delivery trucks with unchecked driving histories,\" she wrote.\n\nShe said the government also provided examples of five recent fatal crashes -- which claimed 12 lives -- involving foreign-domiciled commercial drivers. She said an audit of their foreign records might have denied them permits.\n\nIt's not clear what effect the court ruling will have on the 17,000 revoked licenses in California. Neither that state's motor vehicle bureau nor the U.S. Transportation Department responded to inquiries for this story.\n\nMr. Duffy said the 17,000 were \"just the tip of the iceberg.\"\n\n\"My team will continue to force California to prove they have removed every illegal immigrant from behind the wheel of semitrucks and school buses,\" he said.\n\nMr. Newsom's press office denied the label \"illegal immigrant,\" saying they had \"legal presence\" and had been issued work permits by Homeland Security.\n\nWork permits can, in fact, be issued to migrants who are here without a legal visa.\n\nAs one example, the Biden administration granted millions of illegal border crossers \"parole,\" giving them the tentative legal presence Mr. Newsom's office cited. But they are still inadmissible aliens, or what would usually be considered illegal immigrants.\n\nMr. Duffy also said that California issued driver's licenses that are valid for years after their work permits expire.\n\n\"Blatantly lying to the American people won't help Newsom's keyboard warriors get their next jobs,\" the secretary said.\n\nHe said California was a major reason he issued the non-domiciled driver rule.\n\nThe Transportation Department said Wednesday that it will continue to urge California to revoke all illegal non-domiciled CDLs or risk losing $160 million in federal funds.",

        "description": "Two high-profile Democrats visited the Lone Star State recently and credited Democrats in the Texas House for igniting a nationwide redistricting battle.\n\nIllinois Governor JB Pritzker addressed 650 people at the Dallas County Democratic Party's Johnson Jordan Dinner last Monday.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers from Texas travelled to Chicago over the summer as they broke quorum, delaying a vote by House Republicans to add five Congressional seats.\n\n\"By breaking quorum, you ignited our victories, and you showed us how to fight and win in 2026,\" Pritzker told Democrats. \"You inspire us all. In this moment when we Democrats are sorting through who's on Team Fight and who's on Team Cave, it's important to remember that the fighters are those who've been through the battles before and realize to win, you need to be relentless.\"\n\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom travelled to Houston, where he spoke before hundreds of Democrats. He told them they need to have their sights set on the U.S. House next year.\n\n\"There is no more important race in our lifetimes than the House of Representatives and taking back the House and getting Speaker Jeffries sworn in next November,\" Newsom said. \"It's the whole thing. It's the whole thing.\"\n\nDemocrats and multiple organizations in Texas filed suit against the state in an attempt to block the newly drawn Congressional maps approved by Republicans.\n\nA three-judge panel at the federal court in El Paso held a trial between October 1-10, but they have not decided yet whether to uphold or throw out the maps. Any decision will likely be appealed directly to the U.S. Supreme Court. Because there is no court ruling yet, some candidates running for Congress, particularly Democrats, haven't been able to file their campaign paperwork after the process began Saturday, November 8. The filing deadline is Monday, December 8.",

        "title": "Climate protesters march on COP30 with costumes and drums demanding to be heard",
        "description": "Some wore black dresses to signify a funeral for fossil fuels. Hundreds wore red shirts, symbolizing the blood of colleagues fighting to protect the environment. And others chanted, waved huge flags or held up signs Saturday in what's traditionally the biggest day of protest at the halfway point of annual United Nations climate talks.\n\nOrganizers with booming sound systems on trucks with raised platforms directed protesters from a wide range of environmental and social movements. Marisol Garcia, a Kichwa woman from Peru marching at the head of one group, said protesters are there to put pressure on world leaders to make \"more humanized decisions.\"\n\nThe demonstrators walked about 2.5 miles on a route that took them near the main venue for the talks, known as COP30. Protesters earlier this week twice disrupted the talks by surrounding the venue, including an incident on Tuesday where two security guards suffered minor injuries.\n\nA full day of sessions was planned at the venue, including talks on how to move forward with $300 billion a year in annual climate financial aid that rich countries agreed last year to give to poor nations to help wean themselves off fossil fuels, adapt to a nastier, warmer world and compensate for extreme weather damage. Global temperatures, greenhouse gas emissions and sea levels all reached record highs in 2024, the State of the Global Climate report confirmed.\n\nMany of the protesters reveled in the freedom to demonstrate more openly than at recent climate talks held in more authoritarian countries, including Azerbaijan, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt. Thousands of people joined in a procession that sprawled across most of the march's route.\n\nYouth leader Ana Heloisa Alves, 27, said it was the biggest climate march she has been part of. \"This is incredible,\" she said. \"You can't ignore all these people.\"\n\nAlves was at the march to fight for the Tapajos River, which the Brazilian government wants to develop commercially. \"The river is for the people,\" her group's signs read.\n\nPablo Neri, coordinator in the Brazilian state of Para for the Movimento dos Trabajadores Rurais Sem Terra, an organization for rural workers, said organizers of the talks should involve more people to reflect a climate movement that is shifting toward popular participation.\n\nThe United States, where President Trump has ridiculed climate change as a scam, is skipping the talks. This is the second time the Trump administration has withdrawn from the 10-year-old Paris Agreement, which is being celebrated as a partial achievement here in Belem.\n\nfPresident Trump's actions damage the fight against climate change, former U.S. Special Envoy for Climate Todd Stern said.\n\n\"It's a good thing that they are not sending anyone. It wasn't going to be constructive if they did,\" he said.\n\nTwo U.S. governors, California's Gavin Newsom and New Mexico's Michelle Lujan Grisham, were in Brazil to attend the summit, representing state-level U.S. efforts to curb emissions. Newsom, a Democrat, criticized the Trump administration's decision not to attend, saying earlier in the week that Brazil is a country the U.S. \"should be engaging with, not slapping with 50% tariffs.\"\n\nOne demonstrator, Flavio Pinto, from Para state, took aim at the U.S. Wearing a brown suit and an oversized American flag top hat, he shifted his weight back and forth on stilts and fanned himself with fake hundred-dollar bills with Trump's face on them. \"Imperialism produces wars and environmental crises,\" his sign read.\n\nVitoria Balbina, a regional coordinator for the Interstate Movement of Coconut Breakers of Baba\u00e7u, marched with a group of mostly women wearing domed hats made with fronds of the Baba\u00e7u palm. They were calling for more access to the trees on private property that provide not only their livelihoods but also a deep cultural significance. She said marching is not only about fighting and resistance on a climate and environment front, but also about \"a way of life.\"\n\nThe marchers formed a sea of red, white and green flags as they progressed up a hill. A crowd of onlookers gathered outside a corner supermarket to watch them approach, leaning over a railing and taking cellphone photos. \"Beautiful,\" said a man passing by, carrying grocery bags.\n\nThe climate talks are scheduled to run through Friday. Analysts and some participants have said they don't expect any major new agreements to emerge from the talks, but are hoping for progress on some past promises, including money to help poor countries adapt to climate change.",

        "title": "The BBC's shameful edit and more: Letters to the Editor  --  Nov. 16,...",
        "description": "I was born and raised in the United Kingdom when everyone had complete faith and trust in the BBC as an impartial broadcaster. Sadly, I have witnessed its decline into a mouthpiece for the left (\"Edited out at BBC,\" Nov. 10).\n\nThe old guard was replaced by a younger generation that has no qualms in pushing its own views on the public. The time has come to stop its public funding in the same way President Trump is withdrawing funds from PBS and NPR.\n\nI am rooting for Matias Ferreira to win his lawsuit against Delta and the ignorant staff member who ousted him from the exit row seat (\"Airing grievance,\" Nov. 11).\n\nWhat a disservice to all our brave veterans. Any of us would choose to call on Ferreira should there be an emergency. Going forward, I will not choose to fly Delta. Their staff are no more equipped to assist, except to show us how to use an oxygen mask, than they are to save anyone. Thank you, Mr. Ferreira for your service and bravery.\n\nUC Berkeley protesters ironically tried to shut down free speech while shouting \"fascist\" at others (\"Antifa swarms TPUSA,\" Nov. 12).\n\nRather than foster a dialogue inside, they resorted to violence outside to prevent people from participating in discourse. That act is the definition of fascism.\n\nThe violent protesters need to do more than take a simple look in the mirror and go brush up on real history. Then they can go pick up a mic and debate. Once upon a time, Berkeley was known for that.\n\nNaomi Schaefer Riley hit the nail on the head with her article about the danger of destigmatizing drug use (\"Up in smoke,\" Postscript, Nov. 9)\n\nI'm a recovery advocate and own a small sober-living home for ladies in Bergen County. Last week was my 24-year sober anniversary, and Riley's article was a gift. This destigmatizing trend, along with other well-meaning but ultimately harmful societal shifts, seem to be about money, not human lives.\n\nJoel Pollak's column on Gavin Newsom rightly holds the state's Democratic leaders to account for their failures to assist in rebuilding fire-ravaged areas or implement proven, common-sense policies to help prevent future wildfires (\"Gavin's Victory Lap Leaves Cali Behind,\" PostOpinion, Nov. 11).\n\nBut Newsom and his party's failures go far beyond abandoning victims of the recent fires.\n\nIn fact, it is some of the constituencies that Democrats like to claim as their own which are bearing the heaviest burden from Newsom's policies.\n\nIssues like education, homelessness and poverty are the very problems Democrats claim the moral high ground on. Yet, on Newsom's watch, every one has worsened, and the state he runs has some of the worst results in the country.\n\nThere are certainly good reasons to oppose Donald Trump's xenophobic anti-immigration policies. But throwing something at an innocent federal agent is just as bad as assaulting a doctor who performs abortions if you don't agree with abortion-on-demand (\"Cold cut him a break,\" Nov. 7).",

        "description": "U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi explains why the Department of Justice sued California Gov. Gavin Newsom and how the legal system handles alleged 'sanctuary cities' on 'Hannity.'\n\nFederal agents from U.S. Customs and Border Protection are expected to arrive in the Charlotte area within days, local officials confirmed this week amid growing friction between Washington's immigration enforcement priorities and Democratic-run cities.\n\nThe Mecklenburg County Sheriff's Office said Wednesday that it had been notified of the impending federal presence but emphasized that it has not been asked to assist or participate in any operations. A department spokesperson told Fox News Digital Friday that the sheriff's office had \"zero involvement or participation in any CBP immigration enforcements or operations.\"\n\nThe impending immigration enforcement in North Carolina comes as Sheriff Garry L. McFadden, a Democrat, has sought to maintain open communication with federal agencies while distancing his department from federal immigration enforcement.\n\nGOP URGES DEMOCRAT GOVERNOR TO DEPLOY NATIONAL GUARD TO CHARLOTTE AS CRIME SURGES\n\nCharlotte's anticipated CBP deployment is the latest in a series of similar moves by the federal government to extend border-security operations to other parts of the country.\n\nIn recent months, CBP and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) have sent personnel to major metropolitan areas including Chicago and Washington, D.C.\n\nThose operations have sparked protests from anti-immigration activists. In Portland, Oregon, protests have flared since June. Anti-ICE graffiti has been scrawled outside of detention centers, and demonstrations have become violent at times between protesters and federal agents.\n\nWATCH: Federal immigration agents dodge bullets, speeding cars in CA\n\nFederal officials have described the deployments as part of an expanded effort to disrupt smuggling networks and track illegal aliens.\n\nIn a statement to Fox News Digital, Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said: \"Every day, DHS enforces the laws of the nation across the country. We do not discuss future or potential operations.\"\n\nThe timing of the announcement comes as Charlotte faces intensifying scrutiny over violent crime.\n\nHomicides and aggravated assaults have risen sharply this year, prompting Republican lawmakers to urge Democratic Gov. Josh Stein to deploy the National Guard. For now, the governor has resisted that call from Republican lawmakers, and local officials have argued that public safety remains a local responsibility.\n\n\"Recently, the city faced eight homicides in seven days. The murder rate in uptown Charlotte is now 200% higher than it was a year ago,\" a letter from a trio of Republican lawmakers said. \"According to the Fraternal Order of Police, aggravated assaults involving knives or guns have risen from 86 in 2024 to 111 in 2025, and personal strong-arm robberies have increased from 26 to 31 in the same period.\"\n\nMAJOR CITY POLICE UNIONS SUPPORT FEDERAL TROOP DEPLOYMENTS, BUT LOCAL LEADERS ARE PUSHING BACK\n\nAccording to the Charlotte Police Department's quarterly statistics report, violent crimes, commercial burglaries and larcenies from automobiles have all gone up in Charlotte since last year. But other crimes like homicides, rapes, property crimes and arson have come down modestly from levels in 2024. In many categories, Charlotte's current crime levels are meaningfully lower than rates in 2022 and 2023, with some exceptions.\n\nOn Aug. 22, the stabbing of Ukrainian refugee Iryna Zarutska garnered attention after her killing was captured on surveillance video while she was commuting home from her pizzeria job. The footage captured the 23-year-old cowering as her alleged killer leered over her with a folding knife seconds before the attack.\n\nPolice revealed that her accused killer was identified as Decarlos Brown Jr., a repeat offender with a lengthy rap sheet.\n\nIn his earlier statement Wednesday, McFadden sought to reassure residents that his office \"remains committed to transparency\" and that any coordination with federal agencies will be limited to information-sharing, not enforcement.\n\nCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"It allows us to stay informed and be proactive in keeping Mecklenburg County safe and to maintain the level of trust our community deserves,\" McFadden said.",

        "title": "The Trump administration didn't send a delegation to COP30. How the US is maintaining a presence at the climate summit",
        "description": "The United States is maintaining a presence at COP30, despite the Trump administration declining to send an official delegation to the climate conference in Brazil.\n\nThis is the first time since the inaugural Conference of the Parties (COP) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 1995 that the U.S. will not be officially represented at the annual climate summit.\n\nHowever, a large number of state and local representatives -- as well as environmental nonprofits based in the U.S. -- are in attendance.\n\nA coalition of 100 local U.S. leaders -- including governors, mayors and other top city and state officials -- made the trip to Belem, Brazil, as part of the U.S. Climate Alliance.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom, among the notable Americans at COP30, bashed President Donald Trump for disregarding the event, which kicked off Monday.\n\n\"While Donald Trump skips the world stage, California is showing up -- leading, partnering, and proving what American climate leadership looks like,\" Newsom said on Tuesday.\n\nSen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-RI, said in a press conference on Friday that the \"Trump administration simply does not represent the American public on climate issues.\"\n\nWhitehouse, a ranking member on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, accused the current administration of representing the fossil fuel industry, \"most particularly the big fossil fuel donors who contributed hundreds of millions of dollars to Trump's political campaign.\"\n\nWhy the U.S. did not send any delegates to COP30\n\nThe Trump administration declined to send an official delegation to COP30, according to the White House.\n\n\"The U.S. is not sending any high level representatives to COP30,\" a White House official told ABC News ahead of the start of the conference. \"The president is directly engaging with leaders around the world on energy issues, which you can see from the historic trade deals and peace deals that all have a significant focus on energy partnerships.\"\n\nLast week, U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright told The Associated Press that COP30 is \"essentially a hoax.\"\n\n\"It's not an honest organization looking to better human lives,\" Wright told the AP, follow a two-day business conference in Athens.\n\nWright added that he may attend next year's climate conference \"just to try to deliver some common sense.\"\n\nThe record-breaking U.S. federal government shutdown, which ended late Wednesday, also prevented federal lawmakers from attending the conference.\n\nWho is at COP30?\n\nMost of the nearly 200 countries that participate in the UNFCCC attend COP.\n\nA total of 193 countries, plus the European Union, registered a delegation for the summit. Even North Korea sent a delegation to the climate summit, according to a Carbon Brief analysis.\n\nThe only other countries not in attendance are Afghanistan, Myanmar and San Marino, with each having displayed \"sporadic\" attendance at past conferences, according to Carbon Brief.\n\nOther notable U.S. politicians who made the event include Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers, New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham and former Vice President Al Gore.\n\nSeveral mayors of American cities are also in attendance, including Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego, Annapolis Mayor Gavin Buckley and Savannah Mayor Van Johnson.\n\nAmerican cities have always been at the forefront of innovation and climate action, said Gallego, chair of Climate Mayors and C40 Cities vice chair, in a statement.\n\n\"Mayors across the country are doubling down to fill the current void of leadership at the federal level,\" Gallego said.\n\nOther notable attendees from the U.S. at COP30 this year include Taryn Finnessey, managing director of the U.S. Climate Alliance.\n\nWhy experts say it's important that the US participates in COP30\n\nIt is integral that the U.S., as one of the world's largest emitters of greenhouse gases, to be present at every COP, environmental advocates told ABC News.\n\nThe U.S. shapes markets, capital flows and technology pathways, and therefore engagement by Americans signals to investors that the world's largest economy understands the competitiveness, innovation, security and supply-chain stakes of the energy transition, Maria Mendiluce, CEO of the We Mean Business Coalition, told ABC News.\n\n\"The U.S. has a decisive role in global climate, energy and industrial policy, so sub-national leaders, non-state actors and businesses showing up at COP30 matters,\" Mendiluce said.\n\nBeing on the ground at COP is \"essential\" so delegations can engage with \"full strength,\" Max Frankel, director of the Sustainable Energy and Environment Coalition Institute, told ABC News.\n\nIn addition, the scope and urgency of the climate crisis demands an international response, Max Holmes, president and CEO of the Woodwell Climate Research Center, told ABC News.\n\nIt is important to let other countries know that many Americans are still working to combat climate change, Lynda Hopkins, supervisor of California's 5th district, County of Sonoma, told ABC News.\n\nAlthough the White House isn't in Belem to represent U.S. interest, Americans at COP30 are still working for solutions that are in the best interest of the country, Fred Krupp, president of the Environmental Defense Fund, told ABC News.\n\n\"While the Trump administration retreats, the people and companies here are seizing the opportunity to innovate, create jobs, and build safer, healthier futures,\" Krupp said.\n\nAlthough Hopkins said she and other American subnational delegates were \"warmly received\" by other countries, some prominent figures at COP30 indicated that the U.S. was not needed at the conference to accomplish goals.\n\nChristiana Figueres, a diplomat from Costa Rica who played a key role in the inception of the 2015 Paris Agreement, said the U.S. would not be able to \"do their direct bullying\" due to the Trump administration's boycott of the summit.\n\n\"I actually think it is a good thing,\" Figueres said during a press conference on Tuesday.\n\nFigueres then said, \"Ciao, bambino,\" which translates to \"Bye, little boy,\" in Italian, in response to Trump withdrawing from the Paris Agreement for the second time.\n\nPatrick Drupp, director of climate policy for the Sierra Club, described the Trump administration's absence as \"shortsighted decision\" and a \"slap in the face\" to Americans who want clean air and water and lower energy costs.\n\n\"The reality is that this work will continue with or without America,\" Frankel said.\n\nCOP30 is scheduled to run through Nov. 21.\n\nABC News' Matthew Glasser and Dan Peck contributed to this report.",

        "description": "'Real Time' host Bill Maher and bestselling author Scott Galloway make the case that young men should drink more.\n\n\"Real Time\" host Bill Maher made the case that young men should drink more during a spirited conversation about rejection, friendships and relationships with the bestselling author of \"Notes on Being a Man,\" a book that sounds the alarm on male loneliness.\n\nOn Friday, the late-night host praised author and NYU professor Scott Galloway for calling drinking a \"lubricant\" to socializing.\n\n\"It's not to excess, but yes, drinking a little bit - maybe sometimes a little too much when you're an adolescent - is probably better than sitting in that basement,\" Maher agreed.\n\nNoting that one in five men still live with their parents by age 30, Galloway tore into Big Tech's role in isolating young men, particularly from romantic relationships.

Meanwhile, only 19% of their male counterparts said they would like to leave the U.S. for good, marking what Gallup said was the widest gender gap recorded.\n\n\"I thought it was 'cause of Trump, but apparently it's this,\" Maher mused.\n\n\"It's true,\" Galloway replied. \"The men aren't approaching them.

And you just have to get through that. And I feel like we are further from that than ever.\"\n\nContrary to other reports, 80% of women still expect men to initiate romantic interactions, Galloway posited.\n\nGEN Z MEN 'SCARED' TO DATE, FEAR OF BEING FILMED CREATING 'COLD WAR' OF THE SEXES\n\n\"Yes, they do,\" Maher replied. \"As they should.\"\n\nThe author expressed, \"One of the things we as men really have to train our boys or give them the skill around is one to endure rejection but also to figure out a way to express romantic interest while making that person feel safe.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nRejection in a platonic or a romantic situation is perfectly acceptable, Galloway insisted.\n\n\"Guess what?\" he asked. \"You're both gonna be fine.

        "description": "California is pulling 17,000 commercial driver's licenses given to immigrants. This comes following the discovery that the expiration dates on the licenses had passed the drivers' legally allotted time to stay in the U.S.\n\nThe federal government says California issued them illegally, while the state says the feds are overreaching. Now, some people in the trucking industry say they're the ones caught in the middle.\n\n\"I think the DMV of California messed it up, not those guys,\" said Parmander Dayal, former trucker and the owner of the 99 truck wash and smog check near Yuba City.\n\nDayal says he's already seeing licenses pulled.\n\n\"Yeah, obviously, I'm going to lose some customers. There's a lot of guys that will probably lose their licenses in the Yuba City area, too. So it's going to have a huge impact,\" he said.\n\nThe announcement comes on the heels of two crashes involving drivers from the Northern California area.\n\nRaman Dhillon, the CEO of the North American Punjabi Trucking Association, says the blame shouldn't fall on all the drivers.\n\n\"The cause of the problem is that your schools, your DMVs, they're issuing licenses wrongfully. Schools are training people wrongfully. There's a lot of factors involved. With one click, you take away licenses from all these people and disrupting the whole thing is not a wise decision,\" said Dhillon.\n\nU.S. Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy put out a press release this week stating in part, \"The California DMV has admitted to illegally issuing 17,000 non-domiciled commercial driver's licenses (CDLs) to dangerous foreign drivers.\"\n\nGovernor Gavin Newsom's office says the revocation is not due to dangerous foreign drivers, but due to inconsistency with California law.

        "description": "Two high-ranking men in California politics were arraigned on felony conspiracy charges in federal court on Friday.\n\nThere are five co-conspirators in the bombshell case of political corruption and fraud.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom's former chief of staff, Dana Williamson, was the first to be charged on Wednesday, indicted on 23 fraud-related charges.\n\nSean McCluskie and Greg Campbell both entered not guilty pleas Friday in court, though they are expected to change their pleas to guilty at their upcoming court hearings over the next three weeks.\n\nPlea agreements are already on file for both men.\n\nThe fraud case alleges the five co-conspirators defrauded the federal government and took hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign money to line their own pockets.\n\nAfter the court hearing on Friday, McCluskie and his attorney declined to give a comment to reporters.\n\nCampbell's attorney, Todd Pickles, however, provided a statement and took no questions.\n\n\"Mr. Campbell takes full accountability for his actions and is cooperating fully with the legal process,\" Pickles said in part.\n\nThe alleged kingpin, and the only person not cooperating according to prosecutors, is Williamson.\n\nWilliamson allegedly subscribed to false tax returns, claiming more than $1 million in business deductions that prosecutors said were for personal and nondeductible expenditures, like private jet travel, hotel stays, home furnishings and designer handbags.\n\nShe is also accused of illegally obtaining COVID-era PPP loans and helping funnel Xavier Becerra's campaign money to McCluskie.\n\nMcCluskie is the former chief of staff for Becerra.\n\nBecerra previously served as both California Attorney General and the United States Health and Human Services Secretary. He is currently running for California governor.\n\nFederal court documents allege that, unknown to Becerra, McCluskie stole $225 thousand worth of Becerra's dormant campaign funds for his personal use.\n\nWilliamson is alleged to have helped facilitate it alongside Campbell, a high-profile political consultant. Court documents allege Campbell coordinated the theft through his companies and helped cover it up.\n\n\"Mr. Campbell will, at the appropriate time, further discuss the charges, which do not include Mr. Campbell engaging in the advocacy or lobbying on behalf of any client, receiving any loans to Mr. Campbell or any company owned by Mr. Campbell, or Mr. Campbell profiting from the charged conduct,\" said Pickles on behalf of his client.\n\nBoth men are expected to plead guilty and potentially testify against Williamson for a lesser punishment for their alleged crimes if her case goes to trial.\n\n\"I continue to think the case is extraordinary,\" said Michael Wise, a Sacramento defense attorney unrelated to this case. \"It's the misuse of donated funds for people who believed in the candidate, Mr. Becerra. So I think it's really important for the community that the case has been brought.\"\n\nThe drama in the courtroom could involve top brass in California politics if Williamson faces a jury trial.\n\n\"Is there a scenario where you could see Gov. Gavin Newsom and Xavier Becerra be subpoenaed to testify in a trial?\" I asked Wise.\n\n\"Absolutely, absolutely. Especially Mr. Becerra and potentially the Governor. He would have no right to refuse, as far as I can tell, because it's a federal jurisdiction and he is a state employee,\" said Wise.\n\nThe federal court documents allege Becerra did not know anything about the scheme and nothing at this time suggests Newsom had any knowledge either of Williamson's wrongdoing.\n\nThe Governor's office placed Williamson on leave in November 2024, when they first learned she was under criminal investigation.\n\nMcCluskie will be back in court on Nov. 20 for a change of plea hearing.",

        "title": "Gavin Newsom's pathetic reasons for pulling SOME illegal truckers'...",
        "description": "Gov. Gavin Newsom's critics took a victory lap this week when California revoked 17,000 Commercial Drivers Licenses it had issued to migrant truck drivers whose legal permission to be in the United States ended before the CDLs' expiration dates.\n\nYet the Golden State may still be defying federal law: Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy called the 17,000 the \"tip of the iceberg,\" warning that Team Trump will keep investigating Cali for issuing CDLs to illegal migrants or to drivers who flunked English proficiency exams.\n\nCase in point: Video seems to show Harjinder Singh ignoring signs barring a U-turn on the Florida Turnpike before the deadly crash that killed three in August.\n\nInvestigators said that he had received CDLs in Washington state and California, despite failing the tests several times.\n\nHe also failed an English proficiency test after the crash. (He entered the country illegally in 2018; California claims he later obtained legal status.)\n\nCertainly, the state is still openly defying President Donald Trump's August executive order requiring English proficiency for CDLs: Newsom ordered the California Highway Patrol to ignore it.\n\nThat led Duffy to pull $40 million in federal highway funding; he threatens to withhold $160 million more for not enforcing other new rules.\n\nIn the Biden years, Cali handed out CDLs easily, casting its lax standards as a way of securing US supply chains in the wake of the pandemic.\n\nNewsom's office boasted in 2021 of \"issuing 60 percent more CDLs this year compared to last\" thanks to Biden administration cooperation in cutting \"bureaucratic red tape.\"\n\nSometimes -- especially in California -- red tape makes life impossible. But some rules exist to save lives.\n\nAs governor, Newsom has the power to choose which rules to enforce and which to ignore. He wants to crack down on gas-powered trucks -- but not on drivers who can't read road signs and shouldn't even be in the country.\n\nHe had to be dragged into enforcing the law.\n\nNewsom's belated decision to cut 17,000 CDLs is an admission of bad policy, perhaps with an eye on avoiding queries on the presidential campaign trail about why he let illegal aliens who can't speak English turn 18-wheelers loose on the roads.\n\nThat, and Duffy's threat to withhold funds, are the only reasons Gavin is finally doing the right thing.",

        "description": "California Gov. Gavin Newsom told CNN Democrats \"ceded ground\" on the \"struggles\" of young men and \"it has cost them electorally.\" Michael Bahareen at UnHerd agrees: \"Democrats, especially liberal Democrats, often seem uncomfortable speaking to the plight of men.\" Newsom seeks to address how men are \"now falling behind women\" in many areas, but many Democrats still believe that \"men remain widely more 'privileged' than women\" and that \"traditional masculinity\" is \"problematic.\" Newsom warns: \"We can't afford, from an electoral perspective, to lose these folks.\" Cautions Bahareen: Newsom provides \"a good model for other Democrats\" by meeting \"young men where they are\" and showing \"he cares about them\" -- but that won't do much unless you \"offer them more than just words.\"\n\nFrom the left: Canada's Tortured Talk on Killing\n\n\"Linguistic tap-dancing\" around the killing of 300 diseased ostriches in Canada would've been \"less unnerving,\" suggests Racket's Matt Taibbi, had it not so clearly echoed \"Canada's aggressive word-twisting during the Covid pandemic,\" as well as its \"more recent literary inventions around the country's euthanasia craze.\" In 2021, Canada \"opened the door on mass Kevorkianism\" by increasing eligibility for assisted suicide to include people with a \"grievous and irremediable medical condition,\" as opposed to the imminently dying. \"In a flash, assisted suicide\" became one of Canada's leading causes of death. Now, as \"moral arguments against suicide have mostly vanished,\" Canada is \"scheduled to begin allowing euthanasia/suicide/assisted dying for people suffering from mental illness only.\"\n\nShutdown journal: The Dems' Real 'Base'\n\n\"A government shutdown, as Clausewitz didn't quite say, is the continuation of politics by other means,\" snarks The Wall Street Journal's Barton Swaim. The one that just ended proves it. After all, Obamacare \"premium increases without the subsidies\" certainly weren't \"worth the political risk of a five-week shutdown.\" Rather, the \"stunt\" was meant to show the Dems' base they're ready to fight. Sen. Chuck Schumer feared a primary challenge, perhaps from AOC. Yet the \"base\" isn't rank-and-file Democrats so much as \"cash-flush foundations, unions and activist groups\": the American Civil Liberties Union, the teachers unions, Black Lives Matters, etc. Republicans have nothing similar. And though it may be somewhat true that Republicans cater to President Trump's whims, he'll \"leave office in three years. Progressive nonprofits aren't going anywhere.\"\n\nDefense watch: Our Military-Recruiting U-Turn\n\nThe US military's recruiting shortfall, \"which by 2023 had become a critical national security crisis,\" has turned a corner, cheer the editors of National Review. In fiscal year 2025, \"the Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Space Force all reached their recruiting goals,\" with the Army surpassing it \"four months before the deadline.\" \"There's no doubt\" Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's \"telegenic public-relations focus on lethality, fitness, and 'the warrior ethos'\" has attracted some of the new recruits. But the 2025 National Defense Authorization Act \"surely also had an impact\" by raising \"the base pay of junior enlisted personnel.\" Plus, \"the services began experimenting\" with a \"pre-boot-camp prep course\" that has \"successfully allowed recruits who don't meet the minimum physical or academic standards\" to \"take the very first step of the ladder to a military career.\"\n\nFrom the right: DSA Dizzy After Triumph\n\nEven as the Democratic Socialists of America \"seems poised for a political breakthrough, it shows signs of unraveling,\" smirks Stu Smith at City Journal: Its members are \"intensely divided over whether\" Zohran Mamdani's victory represents \"an electoral success or capitulation to the status quo.\" Various caucuses within the DSA alternately think \"Mamdani is too mainstream,\" while \"others see the mayor-elect as a revolutionary.\" Some radical members even \"believe that Mamdani has become too conservative and friendly to Israel,\" and have dubbed him \"ZIOhran.\" So \"fractured\" is the DSA that Mamdani's \"ideological allies cannot agree on the purpose of his mayoralty, or even whether it's worthwhile.\"",

        "description": "Comedian and podcaster Joe Rogan and Adam Carolla slammed California Gov. Gavin Newsom for his management of California, arguing it was absurd for him to blame climate change for the deadly Palisades wildfires instead of bad management.\n\nJoe Rogan and comedian Adam Carolla criticized California Gov. Gavin Newsom Friday for his rhetoric about climate change, arguing he should blame the Palisades wildfires on poor management by local leaders instead.\n\nNearly a year after the Palisades wildfires became an international news story, critics are still blasting state leaders, accusing them of failing to sufficiently prepare for or competently respond to the fires.\n\n\"The thing about the fires is like, you know, Gavin Newsom's like, 'Oh, climate change,' you know, just blame everything on climate change, which is insane,\" Carolla said on \"The Joe Rogan Experience\" podcast.\n\nNEWSOM PUSHES CLIMATE RECORD ABROAD AS CALIFORNIANS SHOULDER AMERICA'S HIGHEST GAS COSTS\n\n\"That was hilarious,\" Rogan agreed. The podcaster has long criticized California's political leadership, particularly Newsom himself.\n\nCarolla touted New Orleans and Las Vegas as examples of places where people have managed to circumvent the forces of nature to create bustling cities, arguing that California shows it can endure natural disasters like earthquakes thanks to its local codes and rules for buildings.\n\n\"So you can mitigate any of this stuff,\" he said.\n\nBut while California is prepared for earthquakes, local leaders have been repeatedly accused of failing to adequately prepare for the Palisades wildfires.\n\n\"So we did not prepare for the fires. We didn't clear the brush. We didn't fill the reservoirs. We didn't do all the stuff,\" Carolla continued. \"And Newsom goes 'climate change.'\"\n\nLA COMEDIAN CALLS NEWSOM AN 'EMPTY SUIT' THAT ALLOWED THE CITY TO BE BURNED DOWN\n\nRogan agreed, saying Los Angeles has long had the same dry climate and has always faced major fires.\n\n\"LA has always caught fire,\" he said. \"It doesn't rain there. It doesn't rain there ever. And it's been like that forever. That's why they film movies there. It's not climate change, you f------ a------. It's a lack of preparation,\" Rogan said.\n\nCarolla also mocked claims of rapidly rising sea levels, arguing that if they were true, much of the oceanfront property in Los Angeles that has been there since the 1930s and 40s would have been submerged.\n\n\"It's a weird thing because people in California talk about climate change, but the lots that are on the ocean side of PCH are 10 million bucks more than the ones that are up the hill that would be safe from the ocean that was rising,\" he said.\n\nNewsom's office has objected to Rogan and Carolla's claims, which it describes as \"factually inaccurate.\"\n\n\"It is factually inaccurate to say there was a lack of preparation - resources were prepositioned thanks to alerts from the National Weather Service. You can see the historic response by the day here,\" a spokesperson for Newsom's office wrote, linking to a lengthy list of Newsom's efforts, including cutting red tape to streamline the process of rebuilding what was lost.\n\n\"Additionally, it is well-known that there were significant winds (up to 100mph in places) driving embers (seen here) as well as historically dry grounds due to lack of rain fall for a significant period of time (as documented here).\"",

        "title": "Business groups ask Supreme Court to pause California climate reporting laws in emergency appeal",
        "description": "WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. Chamber of Commerce asked the Supreme Court on Friday to pause new California laws expected to require thousands of companies to report emissions and climate-risk information.\n\nThe laws are the most sweeping of their kind in the nation, and a collection of business groups argued in an emergency appeal that they violate free-speech rights.\n\nThe measures were signed by Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom in 2023, and reporting requirements are expected to start early next year.\n\nLower courts have so far refused to block the laws, which the state says will increase transparency and encourage companies to assess how they can cut their emissions.\n\nThe Chamber of Commerce asked the justices to put the laws on hold while lawsuits continue to play out.\n\nOne requires businesses that make more than $1 billion a year and operate in California to annually report their direct and indirect carbon emissions, beginning in 2026 and 2027, respectively.\n\nThat includes planet-warming pollution from burning fossil fuels directly, as well as releases from activities such as delivering products from warehouses to stores and employee business travel. The Chamber of Commerce estimates it will affect about 5,000 companies, though state air regulators say it will apply to roughly 2,600.\n\nThe other law requires companies that make more than $500,000 a year to biennially disclose how climate change could hurt them financially. The state Air Resources Board estimates more than 4,100 companies will have to comply.\n\n\"Without this Court's immediate intervention, California's unconstitutional efforts to slant public debate through compelled speech will take effect and inflict irreparable harm on thousands of companies across the country,\" the companies argued.\n\nCompanies that fail to publish could be subject to civil penalties. ExxonMobil also challenged the laws in a lawsuit filed last month.\n\nThe state has argued that the laws don't violate the First Amendment because commercial speech isn't protected the same way under the Constitution.\n\nIn 2023, Newsom called the emissions-disclosure law an important policy and of the state's \"bold responses to the climate crisis, turning information transparency into climate action.\" The environmental group Ceres has said the information will help people decide whether to support the businesses.\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved a rule last year requiring some public companies to report their greenhouse gas emissions and climate risks, but the agency paused the regulation amid litigation.\n\nThe conservative-majority Supreme Court has cast a skeptical eye on some environmental regulations in recent years, including a landmark decision that limited the Environmental Protection Agency's authority to regulate carbon dioxide emissions from power plants in 2022, and another that halted the agency's air-pollution-fighting \"good neighbor\" rule.",

        "title": "Court blocks new rules limiting which immigrants can get commercial drivers' licenses",
        "description": "The Transportation Department's new restrictions that would severely limit which immigrants can get commercial driver's licenses to drive a semitrailer truck or bus have been put on hold by a federal appeals court.\n\nThe court in the District of Columbia ruled Thursday that the rules Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced in September a month after a truck driver not authorized to be in the U.S. made an illegal U-turn and caused a crash in Florida that killed three people can't be enforced right now.\n\nThe court said the federal government didn't follow proper procedure in drafting the rule and failed to \"articulate a satisfactory explanation for how the rule would promote safety.\" The court said the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration's own data shows that immigrants who hold these licenses account for roughly 5% of all commercial driver's licenses but only about 0.2% of all fatal crashes, the court said.\n\nDuffy has been pressing this issue in California because the driver in the Florida crash received a license in California, and an audit of that state's records showed that many immigrants received licenses in California that were valid long after their work permits expired. Earlier this week, California revoked 17,000 commercial driver's licenses because of that problem. Those licenses were invalidated under the older existing rules - not by the new proposed restrictions affected by this court order.\n\nThe court ruling focused on procedural issues such as whether the Transportation Department properly consulted with states before issuing the new rules.\n\n\"This is not a ruling on the merits of the case. Secretary Duffy will continue working to keep unqualified, foreign drivers off American roads,\" a Transportation Department spokesman said.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom's office didn't respond immediately Friday to questions about the ruling. Newsom's office has said the state followed guidance it received from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security when issuing these licenses to noncitizens.\n\nDuffy has said the Florida crash, along with fatal truck crashes in Texas and Alabama earlier this year, highlighted questions about these licenses. A fiery California crash that killed three people last month involved a truck driver in the country illegally, only added to the concerns.\n\nThe driver in the Florida crash, Harjinder Singh, appeared before a judge in St. Lucie County, Florida, on Thursday, where his attorneys asked to continue his court proceedings into January as they prepare for trial. Singh has pleaded not guilty to three counts of vehicular homicide and three counts of manslaughter.\n\nThe new restrictions on these licenses would only allow immigrants who hold three specific classes of visas to be eligible to get the licenses. States would also have to verify an applicant's immigration status in a federal database. The licenses would be valid for up to one year unless the applicant's visa expires sooner.\n\nUnder the new rules, only 10,000 of the 200,000 noncitizens who have commercial licenses would qualify for them, which would only be available to drivers who have an H-2a, H-2b or E-2 visa. H-2a is for temporary agricultural workers while H-2b is for temporary nonagricultural workers, and E-2 is for people who make substantial investments in a U.S. business. But the rules won't be enforced retroactively, so those 190,000 drivers would be allowed to keep their commercial licenses at least until they come up for renewal.\n\nTrucking trade groups like the Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association have supported the new rule. There is a bill in Congress that would enshrine the new restrictions on commercial driver's licenses in law.\n\n\"For too long, loopholes in this program have allowed unqualified drivers onto our highways, putting professional truckers and the motoring public at risk,\" said Todd Spencer, the trucking association's president.\n\nDuffy has said that California and five other states had improperly issued commercial driver's licenses to noncitizens, but California is the only state Duffy has taken action against because it was the first one where an audit was completed. The reviews in the other states have been delayed by the government shutdown, but the Transportation Department is urging all of them to tighten their standards.\n\nDuffy has revoked $40 million in federal funding because he said California isn't enforcing English language requirements for truckers, and he said earlier this week that he may take another $160 million from the state over these improperly issued licenses if they don't invalidate every illegal license and address all the concerns.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Kate Payne contributed to this report from Tallahassee, Florida.",

Gavin Newsom, during her first interview as a diplomat this week.\n\nGuilfoyle, who was previously engaged to Donald Trump Jr., briefly touched on Newsom and also businessman Eric Villency, her second husband before they split, as she described herself as a loyal person who can always be counted, according to a report.\n\nThe topic of exes came up after a reporter with the Greek station ANT1 brought up divorce during Guilfoyle's first sit-down in her new role.\n\nGuilfoyle, 56, stressed breaking up doesn't mean former spouses can't continue to be friendly toward each other, according to a translated transcript of the interview released by the station.\n\nShe then reportedly said she has a great relationship with Newsom, who has become an antagonist to President Trump during the Republican's second term.\n\nThe former Fox News host also showered praise on Villency, whom she shares a 19-year-old son with, noting they've had a friendship for 20 years.\n\n\"What people need to understand about me is that I don't give up,\" she said, according to the translated transcript provided by ANT1.\n\n\"I will stay with you, I will be loyal.

        "title": "Opinion | The Trump administration is working overtime to burn the world faster",
        "description": "Jay Inslee: Trump and Zeldin turn EPA into 'Environmental Pollution Agency' by revoking climate rule\n\nPresidents, politicians, diplomats and scientists descended on Brazil this week to open the international climate summit known as COP30. Although California's governor made headlines with his remarks, there is no official U.S. delegation, marking the first time that the world's largest economy -- and historically the world's largest carbon emitter -- has refused to participate in global efforts to reduce the harm of climate change.\n\nOn one level, America skipping out on the multilateral talks places a ceiling on just how much effect any commitments made at the conference will have on reducing carbon emissions globally. But in Trump's second term, America has transformed from a potential roadblock during climate talks into an aggressive antagonist. By pulling back from the discussions underway in Bel\u00e9m, President Donald Trump may have given them a greater chance of success than otherwise would have existed.\n\nIt was clear before Trump returned to office that clean-energy technology was not part of his agenda. A centerpiece of his campaign was denouncing the \"Green New Scam,\" as he called it, promising to roll back the Biden administration's climate achievements and investments in renewable energy. In its place would be a set of policies campaign officials described as working to \"maximize fossil fuel production\" -- or, in Trump's words, \"drill, baby, drill.\"\n\nTwo years ago, as another round of climate talks began, I described those Trump campaign proposals as plans to \"kill us all even faster.\" Amazingly, that might have been an understatement, because for the Trump administration's strategy for American energy dominance to succeed, global moves away from fossil fuels must be kneecapped. Rather than merely ignoring the rest of the world's efforts to forestall rising temperatures as we make polluters great again at home, what little progress other countries have made must also be rolled back.\n\nAccordingly, U.S. diplomats have begun impeding multilateral efforts to address climate issues. Last month, the United States tanked an International Maritime Organization deal that would have required global shipping vessels to reduce their emissions or be forced to pay a fee. The treaty was all but done when the Trump administration swooped in, threatening economic sanctions against countries that agreed to the pact as well as pledging to turn away their ships from American ports. Similarly, long-running discussions to set a limit on global plastic pollution were scuttled this summer in the face of administration obstinance. As The Washington Post noted, the plastics industry has become \"a crucial growth market for fossil fuel companies at a time when solar power and electric vehicle uptake is expected to eat into demand.\"\n\nIt's hard then to see, then, what good an official U.S. presence might have achieved in Brazil. If anything, the absence of administration representatives is more likely a blessing in disguise, given that the negotiations rely on consensus. As a follow-up to the Paris Agreement's goal of holding global warming to 1.5 C above preindustrial levels, COP30 is focused on nations implementing their previous pledges to reduce emissions. As things stand, though, the world is set to blow by the 2015 goal in the coming years as temperatures continue to rise unabated, prompting even more chaotic and destructive weather patterns than we are already feeling.\n\nStill, there are some Americans at the summit. California's Gov. Gavin Newsom is making the rounds in Brazil, taking swings at the president and presenting himself as an avatar of the post-Trump era. Beyond the obvious political calculations, Newsom's presence speaks to California's importance on the global stage. The state's economy on its own is equivalent to the fourth-largest in the world, and the standards it sets for emissions and more have a deep impact on how companies everywhere do business. California is part of the U.S. Climate Alliance, a group of 24 states and U.S. territories that have pledged to reduce greenhouse gases regardless of the White House's stance.\n\nThe effort mirrors the strategy of COP 30 host country Brazil toward ensuring the summit's success. As Foreign Policy reported, Brazil's \"approach to COP30 is what some climate strategists call 'coalitions of the doing.' Rather than waiting for absolute consensus among U.N. member states, Brazil is moving in smaller groups to push action forward and emphasizing how climate action can lead to economic development.\" Those states only have to look to China's growth in renewable energies, which makes up 10% of its entire economy, to see that there's real potential to tap into that growth themselves.\n\nThe idea that America should be on the forefront of developing and scaling new, profitable technologies rather than playing defense for oil and coal is heretical to this administration. Instead, Washington has focused on producing ever more carbon-spewing fuels. Couple that with an obsession with artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency -- which both demand vast amounts of energy to power their data centers and water to cool them -- and the Trump administration's vision is an America that is increasingly harmful to the planet's long-term survival. Thankfully, the rest of the world isn't waiting for us to get our act together before trying to avoid the impending climate disaster that Trump, disbelieving facts and science, derides as a hoax.",

Typically, federal U.S. officials attend the summit, but the administration skipped the event as President Donald Trump rails against climate change as \"the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world.\"\n\nNEWSOM VOWS TO BLOCK TRUMP'S REPORTED ENERGY PLAN IN CALIFORNIA, EXPERTS PUSH BACK\n\n\"Absolutely,\" Newsom said Wednesday when asked if California was standing in for the U.S. at the summit, the Los Angeles Times reported. \"And I think the world sees us in that light, as a stable partner, a historic partner ... in the absence of American leadership. And not just absence of leadership, the doubling down of stupid in terms of global leadership on clean energy.\"\n\nThe governor's office touted amid the trip that \"Greenhouse gas emissions in California are down 21% since 2000 -- even as the state's GDP increased 81% in that same time period,\" and that \"the state was powered by two-thirds clean energy\" in 2023.\n\nCalifornia currently has the highest average gas prices in the nation, data shows.\n\nThe Golden State has long had notoriously high gas prices, and 2025 is no different. California currently has the highest average gas prices in the nation, at an average of $4.67 per gallon, followed by a list of other states, including Hawaii, Washington, Nevada and Oregon.\n\nHoliday travel is about to hit a fever pitch across the country as the aviation industry gets back on its feet following the historically long government shutdown that led to nationwide delays -- with many travelers expected to hop in their cars for a road trip this Thanksgiving and Christmas season.\n\nLONGTIME NEWSOM CRITIC PUTS UN SUMMIT ON NOTICE IF DEM GOVERNOR IS ALLOWED TO SPEAK: 'CLIMATE HYPOCRISY'\n\nThe White House slammed California's high gas prices to Fox News Digital Thursday while Newsom was abroad.\n\n\"Governor Newscum is working overtime to cement his status as the worst governor in America,\" White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers told Fox News Digital. \"Under his failed leadership, the great state of California is suffering with some of the highest gas and electricity prices in the country.\"\n\n\"In fact, California drivers pay $1.60 more than the national average for a gallon of gasoline,\" she added. \"Gavin, it's time to abandon your failed Green New Scam experiment and embrace President Trump's successful energy dominance agenda.\"\n\nNewsom office spokesperson Izzy Gardon told Fox Digital on Thursday that current gas prices in the state are lower than in 2019, when Newsom was inaugurated California's top leader.\n\n\"Year over year, in real dollars, gas prices in California today are lower than they were in the Governor's first year in office -- and Californians are getting up to $60 billion in utility bill rebates thanks to climate policies Trump is too lazy or too stupid to understand,\" Gardon said. \"While Trump tries to Make Black Lung Great Again, Governor Newsom is in Brazil fighting for clean energy, more jobs, and a livable planet.\"\n\nThe nation's average gas price has fallen in recent months, sitting at about $3.08 as of Thursday, after reaching a high of $5 per gallon in the summer of 2022 under the Biden administration, according to Gas Buddy data.\n\nRed states currently report the lowest prices, including Oklahoma touting the lowest average price in the nation, at a state average of $2.48 per gallon, followed by four other red states with low gas averages: Mississippi, Arkansas, Louisiana and Texas.\n\nNEWSOM CLAIMS TRUMP IS 'HANDING THE FUTURE TO CHINA' AT BRAZILIAN CLIMATE CONFAB THAT WH SKIPPED\n\nThe U.S. Energy Information Administration, which is the Department of Energy's statistical arm that publishes policy-independent data, attributed California's higher prices at the pump to a spate of policies, including state taxes and fees, environmental requirements, and special fuel requirements.\n\nCalifornians pay an extra $0.90 per gallon in local, state, and federal taxes as of March 2025, while the California Energy Commission estimated that residents pay an additional $0.54 a gallon in environmental compliance costs. The state also requires that fuel in the state be a special blend that cuts back on pollution, but also comes at a higher price tag, according to the Energy Information Administration.\n\nNEWSOM SET TO RALLY TEXAS DEMS WITH VICTORY LAP DAYS AFTER PROP 50 PASSES: 'CALIFORNIA STEPPED UP'\n\nNewsom and Trump long have been political foes, with their battles frequently focusing on energy policy, including Trump slamming Newsom over its water reserves in a state prone to devastating wildfires, and Trump signing a trio of congressional resolutions ending California's restrictive rules for diesel engines and mandates on elective vehicle sales in July.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nFox News Digital reached out to Newsom's office for comment on the matter but did not immediately receive a response.",

        "description": "Rainfall rates could reach 1 inch per hour in parts of Southern California.\n\nOver 22 million people in Southern California are under a flood watch as a West Coast storm could slam burn scar areas, bringing potential mudslides, debris flows and excessive rainfall.\n\nEvacuation warnings are now in place through Friday evening for the following burn scar areas: Canyon, Bethany, Eaton, Palisades, Hurst, Kenneth, Sunset, Lidia, Franklin and Bridge, according to Los Angeles County officials.\n\n\"Anyone in these areas should be ready to leave at a moment's notice,\" county officials said.\n\nThe storm will bring light to moderate rain for most of Friday, but the main threat for flooding will begin Friday night going into Saturday, with excessive rainfall -- accompanied by lightning and some strong wind gusts -- possible for some areas.\n\nBeginning late Friday, evacuation orders will be in effect for the following burn scar areas: Canyon, Bethany, Eaton, Palisades, Hurst, Kenneth, Sunset, Lidia, Franklin and Bridge.\n\nAccording to the Los Angeles Public Works, some streets may be \"entirely blocked by debris\" and some structures may be at risk depending on location.\n\nThese areas could see 1 inch of rain per hour, with rainfall between Friday and Saturday totaling 4 to 6 inches. Areas with the heaviest storms or at higher elevations could see 6 inches of rain or more.\n\nA moderate risk for excessive rainfall and flash flooding is in place for Los Angeles and Santa Barbara areas, mostly for the heaviest rain which is expected on Friday night, Saturday morning and early Saturday afternoon.\n\nThe heavy rain will be occurring from 8 p.m. local time Friday to 3 p.m. Saturday. More rain is possible in these areas every day next week, with the threat of mudslides and debris flows continuing due to the already-saturated ground.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom announced on Thursday that emergency resources will be pre-deployed ahead of the storm to protect communities in the Los Angeles, Orange and Ventura counties from mudslides and debris flows.\n\nOn average, Los Angeles records 0.8 inches of rain the entire month of November, with the record being 9.68 inches in 1965. This storm beginning on Friday could likely be more than a November months' worth of rain within a day for these areas.",

        "title": "Anti-Trump network behind mass protests cracks open war chest against Dems who backed reopening government",
        "description": "VA Secretary Doug Collins joins 'Fox & Friends First' to discuss how the shutdown is impacting the Department of Veterans Affairs and mark the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Marines.\n\nA left-wing group behind the massive \"No Kings\" protests targeting President Donald Trump and his administration launched its largest primary undertaking: targeting Senate Democrats who joined Republicans to reopen the government.\n\n\"This is no longer about them - it's about us. We're done waiting for Democrats to find their spine,\" Ezra Levin, co-founder and co-executive director of Indivisible, said in a Monday press release. \"We can't afford a weak and cowardly Democratic Party while the authoritarians invade our cities, terrorize our communities, and threaten our democracy. We get the party we demand, and we intend to demand a Democratic Party that fights.\"\n\nIndivisible is one of the key groups behind the massive \"No Kings\" protests that were held across the country earlier in 2024, including on June 14, when Trump held a military parade in Washington, D.C., and most recently on Oct. 18, when protesters railed against Trump's immigration policies and reiterated claims that Trump conducts himself as a monarch as opposed to a president.\n\nThe protests are supported by dozens of left-wing and liberal groups, with Indivisible, the 50501 movement and the No Kings Organization, itself, identified as the top organizers of the protests.\n\nSCHUMER PUSHES SHUTDOWN INTO RECORD BOOKS AFTER REJECTING GOP BILL A 14TH TIME\n\nIndivisible launched in 2017, as Trump's first term kicked off, and describes itself as a network of local grassroots groups that advocates for the elections of left-wing lawmakers, while advocating current lawmakers resist MAGA policies. The group is funded, in part, by left-wing billionaire George Soros' Open Society Foundations, which delivered Indivisible a two-year grant worth $3 million in 2023 that works to \"to support the grantee's social welfare activities,\" Fox News Digital previously reported.\n\n\"Chuck Schumer and a critical mass of Senate Democrats surrendered,\" Levin said. \"For nearly six weeks, Republicans held the government hostage while threatening health care, food assistance, and basic services for millions of Americans.\"\n\n\"In these six weeks of the shutdown, Democrats had their best election night in over a decade, polls showed Republicans were losing this shutdown fight, and their base turned out for the largest protest in modern U.S. history with a resounding rejection of Trump and Republicans,\" Levin continued in his comments. \"Instead of standing with that energy, Senate Democrats surrendered - yet again. That's why Indivisible is launching our largest primary program yet.\"\n\nSeven Senate Democrats and Independent Sen. Angus King, who caucuses with the Democrats, splintered with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer Sunday evening to vote in favor of passing a revamped plan to reopen the government. The government has been shut down since Oct. 1, becoming the longest federal government shutdown in U.S. history.\n\nIn addition to King, Sens. John Fetterman, D-Pa., Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nev., Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., Maggie Hassan, D-N.H., Jacky Rosen, D-Nev., Tim Kaine, D-Va., and Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin, D-Ill, joined the Republicans.\n\n\"Our democracy is facing an existential threat. We need leaders with backbone and conviction -- not timidity and excuses,\" Indivisible's co-founder and co-executive director Leah Greenberg said of the primary plan. \"Democrats can't defeat authoritarianism by running from the fight. It's in our hands to make sure those who can't fight make space for the leaders who can. Indivisible is ready to clean house and build a party that actually has the energy to act like an opposition.\"\n\nAt the heart of the shutdown was a debate on healthcare. Trump and Republican pinned shutdown blame on Democrats for working to include healthcare benefits for illegal immigrants in the package. Democrats denied the claims and argued the government was shut down due to Republicans failing to negotiate healthcare demands.\n\nThe House voted later Wednesday to reopen the government. The bill then headed to Trump's desk for his signature to officially end the longest federal shutdown in U.S. history.\n\nA handful of left-wing lawmakers and leaders slammed Senate Democrats for joining the GOP earlier this week, such as Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders describing Sunday as a \"very bad night.\"\n\nJOHN FETTERMAN BREAKS WITH DEMOCRATS IN SHUTDOWN VOTE, SAYS IT'S AN 'EASY CHOICE' TO PUT AMERICA FIRST\n\n\"Pathetic. This isn't a deal. It's a surrender. Don't bend the knee!,\" Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom's official press office X account posted Sunday evening. Newsom added on his own X account: \"America deserves better,\" as well as another message that just read, \"pathetic.\"\n\n\"As this vote moves to the House, I stand with Democratic leadership as they refuse to rubber stamp the full-scale Republican assault on Americans' health care and I am proud of the majority of Senate Democrats who opposed this vote,\" DNC Chair Ken Martin posted to X.\n\n\"I've said it since the start of this shutdown -- Republicans do not negotiate in good faith, and any deal that fails to protect healthcare is not a deal at all. For Democrats to cave now would be a complete betrayal of the American people,\" Illinois Lt. Governor and Senate candidate Juliana Stratton posted to X.\n\nOthers, including Indivisible and Democratic California Rep. Ro Khanna, have called for Schumer to be replaced over the handling of the shutdown.\n\nIndivisible's primary plan, which is dubbed as the group's \"largest\" primary effort to date, includes calling on Schumer to step aside as Senate minority leader, and backing Senate candidates who hold a \"clear commitment to abandon the status quo of feckless leadership, and use every tool available to fight MAGA attacks on our communities, our health, and our democracy.\"\n\n\"Ahead of the 2026 primaries, Indivisible will be activating (it's) (sic) network to support progressive fighters who are challenging feckless, status-quo-loving incumbents. In a recent movement survey, 98.67% of Indivisible's base said they wanted Senate Democrats to keep fighting,\" the group wrote, adding that its plan is coming together with more details, candidate endorsements and campaign efforts expected in the coming weeks.\n\nFox News Digital reached out to Indivisible Wednesday morning for additional comment on the plan but did not immediately receive a response.\n\nSENATE RETURNS TO WORK AS GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN NEARS LONGEST IN US HISTORY OVER OBAMACARE FIGHT\n\nWhen asked about the Democrat in-fighting over the eight lawmakers who joined the GOP, the White House reiterated that Trump has wanted the government to reopen since Oct. 1.\n\nCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"President Trump has wanted the government reopened since the first day Democrats shut it down. The action in the Senate is a positive development and we look forward to seeing it progress,\" a White House official told Fox Digital.\n\nTrump joined Fox News' Laura Ingraham Monday evening, arguing the Republican Party \"broke\" Schumer.\n\n\"I think he made a mistake in going too far,\" Trump said during the interview. \"He thought he could break the Republicans, and the Republicans broke him.\"\n\nFox Digital reached out to Schumer's office regarding outrage among some Democrats over the splintering vote and mounting calls for him to step aside but did not receive a response.",

        "title": "These California counties won by Trump in 2024 supported Prop. 50 in the special election. Here's what to know",
        "description": "Richard Ramos is a web producer for CBS Sacramento who was born and raised in Sacramento. He graduated with a BA in Journalism from CSUS.\n\nA majority of voters in seven California counties won by President Trump in 2024 also supported Proposition 50 in a special election earlier this month, helping pass the redistricting measure championed by Gov. Gavin Newsom and legislative Democrats.\n\nData show that ballots cast to approve Prop. 50 -- which passed with 64% of the vote -- outnumbered \"no\" votes in Fresno, Imperial, Lake, Merced, Riverside, San Bernardino and San Joaquin counties, each of which was carried by Mr. Trump in the last presidential election. No California counties that voted for Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election voted no on Proposition 50, according to data from the California Secretary of State's Office (SOS) for both elections.\n\nProp. 50 temporarily redraws five of the state's Republican-held congressional districts to make them more favorable to being won by Democrats in the 2026 midterms. It was placed on the ballot by Democratic lawmakers hoping to offset redistricting efforts in Texas that flipped five Democratic districts to Republican.\n\nAccording to the measure, the nonpartisan California Citizens Redistricting Commission will resume drawing the state's congressional maps after the 2030 U.S. Census.\n\nIt remains unclear why a majority of voters in the seven counties Trump won cast their ballots in support of Prop. 50. An October CBS News poll conducted before the election found that 75% of the likely voters surveyed who planned to vote for Prop. 50 said one of the reasons they were doing so was to oppose Mr. Trump. Seventy percent of likely voters polled who were voting \"yes\" on the measure said another reason they were doing so was to oppose national Republicans.\n\nHere's what to know about the California counties where most voters approved Prop. 50:\n\nFresno County, the second-most-populous county in California's Central Valley, voted for a Republican in a presidential election for the first time in 20 years in 2024, with 51% of the vote going to Mr. Trump, according to the California Secretary of State's (SOS) Office.\n\nIn the Nov. 4 special election, 51% of Fresno County voters said \"Yes\" to Prop. 50, according to state data as of Nov. 12, narrowly surpassing the 49% of voters who rejected the measure.\n\nSitting on the southern border, Imperial County is 85% Latino, according to 2023 U.S. Census data. In the 2024 presidential election, Mr. Trump won the county with 49% of the vote, according to data from the SOS, making him the first Republican presidential candidate to do so since 1988.\n\nIn the Nov. 4 special election, 60% of Imperial County voters approved Proposition 50, as of Nov. 12.\n\nLake County, which contains Clear Lake and a portion of California's Wine Country, voted Republican last year in a presidential election for the first time since Ronald Reagan carried the county in 1984.\n\nMr. Trump narrowly won the county in 2024. Proposition 50 passed there with 52% of the vote, as of Nov. 12.\n\nThe Central Valley's Merced County has started leaning more conservative in recent years. After voting Democrat in every presidential election since 2008, the county voted to recall Newsom in 2021 and voted against him in 2022.\n\nIn the 2024 presidential election, 51% of the vote went to Mr. Trump. The county approved Proposition 50 with 54% of voters saying yes, as of Nov. 13.\n\nDemocrats won Riverside County in presidential elections from 2008 to 2020. But in 2024, Mr. Trump narrowly defeated then-Vice President Kamala Harris, receiving 49% to 48%.\n\n\"Yes\" on Prop. 50, however, received 56% of the vote in Riverside County, as of Nov. 12.\n\nTwo of the Republicans who are impacted by Proposition 50, Reps. Ken Calvert and Darrell Issa, currently represent districts that include portions of Riverside County. Calvert's district is entirely within Riverside County, while Issa's current district includes portions of Riverside and San Diego counties.\n\nSan Bernardino County held steady in presidential elections, voting Democratic from 2008 to 2020 before going for Mr. Trump in 2024.\n\nProp. 50 passed with 57% of the vote, as of Nov. 13, marking a significant change from Mr. Trump's 50% in last year's election.\n\nMr. Trump earned a narrow victory in San Joaquin County in 2024 with 48.69% of the vote, edging out Harris by about 2,000 of the more than 264,000 votes cast. He was the first Republican presidential candidate to carry the county since George W. Bush in 2004.",

        "description": "President Donald Trump reacted to the 2025 election by piling on the communist accusations about Zohran Mamdani. See what they had to say.\n\n* President Donald Trump has a net positive approval rating in 24 states, according to a Morning Consult poll.\n\n* National polling aggregators show Trump's approval rating is net negative and has recently dropped to a term low.\n\nThe battle over state redistricting efforts is heating up with the Department of Justice joining a lawsuit against California Gov. Gavin Newsom.\n\nDemocrats won big in state and local elections on Nov. 4, in what many see as a firm rebuke of President Donald Trump's policies. It spells more trouble for Republicans the 2026 midterms, where Democrats are hoping to regain control of at least one chamber of Congress.\n\nAmong the wins was California's Proposition 50, which temporarily allows the state to redraw its Congressional maps without the nonpartisan commission to try to offset the Republican seats gained by Texas' new map.\n\nAs Trump's approval ratings nationally have continued to fall in recent weeks, according to aggregators, what are his approval ratings among the states?\n\nWhat states give Trump the highest approval rating?\n\nTrump has a net positive approval rating in 24 states, according to Morning Consult, which gathers polls over the course of three months to get a look at state-level data among registered voters. The Nov. 12 update has the same number of above-water states as the previous month's update.\n\nTrump's approval rating is net negative in every 2024 swing state, Morning Consult found. As previously, Trump received his best approval rating in Wyoming and worst in Vermont, though it should be noted that small states have the widest margin of error in these polls.\n\nThe percentage of voters who approve of Trump's job performance in New Jersey and Virginia over recent months was commensurate with the votes received by Republican gubernatorial candidates who lost, according to Morning Consult, which found 42% of voters approved of Trump's job performance in those states over the months leading up to the election. Republican candidate Winsome Earle-Sears of Virginia lost to Democrat Abigail Spanberger with 42.3% of the vote, according to unofficial results. Republican candidate Jack Ciattarelli of New Jersey lost to Democratic U.S. Rep. Mikie Sherrill with 42.8% of the vote, according to the New York Times.\n\nWhat is Trump's approval rating on average?\n\nAverages based on RealClearPolitics and New York Times aggregators show Trump's approval rating is net negative, and after months of being relatively stable, has dropped quickly in recent weeks.\n\nAs of Jan. 27, 50.5% approved, giving Trump a net positive rating until March 13, when it flipped to net negative with 47.8% approval, compared to 48.5% disapproval, RealClearPolitics graphics show. The approval rating reached a low on April 29 at 45.1% approval, which fell around Trump's 100-day mark. It reached a new low of 42.4% on Nov. 12, as the longest shutdown in American history came to an end.\n\nThe New York Times aggregator showed Trump's approval fell from 52% approval in January to 44% approval in April, and then mostly held steady for months. According to the Times, Trump's term low is 41% approval, which he first reached on Nov. 12.\n\nTrump's approval rating is low compared to other presidents\n\nIn a Gallup poll conducted from Oct 1-16, 41% approved of Trump's job performance, up slightly from the previous month.\n\nA historical analysis by Gallup shows Trump's approval ratings in October of his first years in office - both as the 45th and 47th presidents - are lower than any other modern president at the same time in their administrations.

        "title": "Conservative Media Picks an Epstein Story Line and Sticks to It",
        "description": "Right-wing outlets have focused on a single redacted name in the 23,000 pages of correspondence related to Jeffrey Epstein that were released on Wednesday.\n\nRight-wing media had a similar first response to new emails tying President Trump to the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein: thunderous silence.\n\nFor hours, Fox News made nary a mention of the tranche, whose contents suggested, among other things, that the president knew more about the abuses perpetrated by Mr. Epstein, a former friend, than he had admitted.\n\nProminent podcasters like Ben Shapiro and Megyn Kelly focused on H-1B visas, the government shutdown and a proposal for 50-year mortgages on their shows and social media.\n\nAnd the online troll account known as Catturd, which posts dozens of times every day to its nearly four million followers on X, spent the morning attacking Michelle Obama, Gov. Gavin Newsom of California and James Comey, the former director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\n\nBut as time wore on, right-wing media figures began coalescing around another approach: focusing on a single redacted name in the emails.\n\nThey argued that Democrats on the House Oversight Committee -- who had released three emails early on Wednesday -- had created a false narrative by hiding the name of one of Mr. Epstein's victims in one of the messages. The redaction, the theory went, was meant to cover up that the victim, Virginia Giuffre, previously said she had never witnessed Mr. Trump involved in sexual abuse of minors.\n\n\"This was done intentionally,\" Rob Schmitt, a Newsmax anchor, wrote in an early-afternoon post on X that quickly spread widely. He followed up with a selfie-style video in a gym. \"This is how sick and twisted these people are,\" Mr. Schmitt said in the video, which he shared on Rumble. \"They are vile creatures. This is what we're up against.\"\n\nIn the dependably administration-friendly world of conservative media, the question of how to address the president's relationship with Mr. Epstein has proved particularly thorny. It has pitted abiding loyalty to Mr. Trump against growing demands from the MAGA base that the federal government release all its files related to the notorious predator.\n\nBut the unified response to this week's disclosures shows how closely aligned right-wing media voices are with elected Republicans and the degree to which the two share story lines -- and provide each other political cover. Indeed, the core message that ended up emanating from conservative media this week originated within the Oversight Committee itself, which jumped on the redaction question less than an hour after the three emails dropped.\n\n\"Why did Democrats cover up the name?\" Republicans on the committee asked on X, adding: \"Democrats are trying to create a fake narrative to slander President Trump.\"\n\nThe White House also jumped into the conversation. \"The 'unnamed victim' referenced in these emails is the late Virginia Giuffre, who repeatedly said President Trump was not involved in any wrongdoing whatsoever,\" Karoline Leavitt said in a statement midday Wednesday. She called the redactions an effort to \"smear President Trump.\"\n\nAlthough the committee also released some 23,000 pages of additional correspondence from Mr. Epstein on Wednesday, including dozens of messages discussing the president in sometimes unflattering terms, pro-Trump outlets accordingly fixated on that one redacted email.\n\n\"So far, they have proved NOTHING NEGATIVE against President Trump,\" wrote David Freeman, an influencer who posts on X under the account name Gunther Eagleman and has 1.6 million followers.\n\nAccording to House Democrats, there is no conspiracy: They redacted the name because of a standing practice on the committee not to name victims of sexual abuse. In August, Representative James R. Comer of Kentucky, the Republican chairman of the committee, said in a statement that he would release documents related to the Justice Department's investigation only after ensuring that \"the identification of victims and any child sexual abuse material are redacted.\"\n\nLater that month, the committee subpoenaed Mr. Epstein's estate and since then has released multiple batches of documents, totaling tens of thousands of pages, with redactions. The large dump on Wednesday was no different, peppered by blacked-out sections presumably hiding names and other identifying information.\n\nBut after Ms. Leavitt's remarks on Wednesday, Republicans on the committee released an unredacted copy of the email that the Democrats had put out, in apparent violation of the committee's policy. It confirmed that Ms. Giuffre was the person named by Mr. Epstein in the 2011 email.\n\nMs. Giuffre died in April; her family said it was by suicide. In a 2016 deposition, she testified that while Mr. Trump and Mr. Epstein were good friends, she didn't \"think Donald Trump had participated in anything.\" In her memoir, released after her death this year, she said that \"Trump couldn't have been friendlier,\" and never publicly accused him of wrongdoing.\n\nHouse Democrats have stood firm on the question of redactions.\n\n\"We don't confirm or deny the names of victims,\" said Sara Guerrero, a spokeswoman for Democrats on the Oversight Committee. She added that they \"have promised all survivors and their families that we will keep their identities private out of respect for them, and our commitment is that we redact all of their names from these documents.\"\n\nBut right-wing outlets have continued to make their argument that Democrats had deliberately cooked up a controversy and that there was, they said, nothing to see here.\n\n\"Democrats tried to frame Donald Trump and got caught the same day, and it is insane,\" Tim Pool, a podcaster, said on his show Thursday morning.\n\nHe, like many other conservative commenters, also latched on to the fact that in a number of the emails, the journalist Michael Wolff gave advice to Mr. Epstein about Mr. Trump. Mr. Pool called it \"evidence of collusion\" to damage the president's reputation.\n\n\"Trump never did anything wrong,\" Mr. Pool said, without addressing any of the thousands of other emails released this week.\n\nBenny Johnson, a right-wing podcaster and staunch supporter of the president, framed it in starker terms. \"They should be sued for this,\" he said of congressional Democrats on his podcast on Thursday. \"They didn't expose President Trump.\"",

        "title": "Newsom's ex-aide indicted on corruption, fraud charges. Here's what to know about the case.",
        "description": "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- California Gov. Gavin Newsom's former chief of staff was arrested and indicted on federal corruption charges this week, roughly a year after she disclosed the investigation to Newsom's office and was placed on leave.\n\nDana Williamson is accused of helping in a scheme to steal campaign money from former federal Health Secretary Xavier Becerra, filling fraudulent tax forms for personal expenses and making false statements to law enforcement.\n\nNeither Becerra nor Newsom are accused of any wrongdoing in the indictment. Becerra, now a candidate for California governor, called the news \"a gut punch.\"\n\nNewsom's office noted Wednesday that Williamson no longer worked in the office and later revealed Williamson had been placed on leave in November 2024 after telling the office she was under criminal investigation. Her leave was not publicly disclosed at the time. Newsom's office formally announced her departure and his hiring of a new chief of staff that December.\n\nHere's what to know:\n\nA longtime Democratic power broker in the Capitol circle, Williamson worked as an adviser to former Gov. Gray Davis and as a Cabinet secretary for former Gov. Jerry Brown before opening her own political affairs firm. She served as Becerra's campaign manager when he ran for state attorney general in 2018.\n\nShe was named Newsom's chief of staff in late 2022, a job she held for roughly two years.\n\nWilliamson is known for her savvy and aggressive style, often unafraid to spar publicly and privately with those who disagree with her.\n\nFederal authorities said the investigation into Williamson began under the Biden administration more than three years ago.\n\nThe indictment, first reported by the Sacramento Bee, includes 23 charges of conspiracy to commit bank and wire fraud, bank fraud, wire fraud, conspiracy to defraud the United States and obstruct justice, subscribing to false tax returns, and making false statements.\n\nShe entered a not guilty plea in federal court Wednesday.\n\nWilliamson is accused of developing a plan to help Sean McCluskie, a longtime Becerra aide, siphon $225,000 from one of Becerra's dormant state campaign accounts to pad his salary after he accepted a job as his chief of staff in Washington.\n\nShe then allegedly arranged for another person, an unnamed former public official, to take over the operation before joining Newsom's office.\n\nWilliamson is said to falsify business contracts related to Paycheck Protection Program loans that her business received during the COVID-19 pandemic. She also allegedly filed fraudulent tax forms from 2021 to 2023 to claim more than $1 million in business deductions for personal expenses, such as luxury handbags and jewelry; private jet travel; vacations in Mexico; installation of a home HVAC system; and several hundred thousand dollars paid to various relatives for fake jobs.\n\nShe could face up to 20 years in prison if convicted.\n\nThe federal indictment lists four other co-conspirators.\n\nMcCluskie, Becerra's ex-aide, signed a plea agreement Oct. 30 in which he admitted to one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud and wire fraud. Lobbyist Greg Campbell also signed a plea deal admitting to one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud and wire fraud and one count of conspiracy to defraud the United States.\n\nProsecutors didn't name the last co-conspirator, who took over handling the payments from Williamson when she joined Newsom's office.\n\nThe scheme began after McCluskie agreed to take the job as Becerra's chief of staff in 2022, a role that resulted in a pay cut of roughly $180,000, according to his plea agreement.\n\nWilliamson used her political consulting company to bill Becerra's campaign account for purported services. The money would then be sent to Campbell's company as a conduit before reaching McCluskie's wife.\n\nNewsom is not mentioned in the indictment, and it does not allege any wrongdoing by Williamson related to her state government job.\n\nBut Williamson's attorney, McGregor Scott, told Los Angeles Times that federal authorities under the Biden administration asked her to cooperate in a probe into the governor more than a year ago. He didn't provide any details.\n\n\"She told them she had no information to provide them, and then we wind up today with these charges,\" Scott said in a statement to The Times. He did not respond to requests for comment from The Associated Press.\n\nNewsom's office said the governor was unaware of any investigation involving him, a spokesperson said in a statement Thursday.\n\nScott was the U.S. attorney in Sacramento during President Donald Trump's first term and under former President George W. Bush. He criticized how the federal government handled Williamson's arrest, saying she was not given an option to surrender and that federal authorities are aware that Williamson is undergoing serious health challenges.\n\nThough the arrest sent shock waves in Sacramento, few lawmakers, lobbyists or other Capitol insiders have publicly commented on it. Republican Assemblyman David Tangipa said the indictment revealed wider problems. \"This is not just one bad actor,\" he said in a campaign email. \"It's a symptom of a broken culture of power and privilege in Sacramento.\"\n\nWilliamson was released Wednesday on a $500,000 bond under travel restrictions. Her house will be used as collateral.\n\nAs part of her conditions for release, Williamson will have to surrender her passport and is prohibited from consuming alcohol or drugs. She also cannot contact any of the co-conspirators.",

        "title": "Texas GOP regret 'their overconfidence' as Trump-led effort 'may end up backfiring'",
        "description": "Texas Governor Greg Abbott speaks to the media at a press conference in the aftermath of deadly flooding in Hunt, Texas, U.S., July 8, 2025. REUTERS/Sergio Flores\n\nAfter Texas Republicans' intial success in redistricting, President Donald Trump's gerrymandering strategy is starting to backfire, writes Salon's Heather Digby Parton, and as Democrats have the last laugh, Republicans are starting to doubt their \"overconfidence\" in Trump's strength.\n\nTexas Democrats fled the state on two separate occasions -- once in 2021 and once in 2025 -- to block Republican legislation by denying the state House a quorum.\n\nTheir protests in 2021 centered on a restrictive voting bill, while the 2025 action was to oppose a new congressional map they condemned as a partisan gerrymander.\n\nAnd while Digby Parton notes that the Texas Democrats were \"forced to capitulate down the road,\" she also says that their taking a stand was well worth it.\n\n\"Although the Texas Democrats didn't succeed in stopping the Republicans, their doomed strategy achieved something just as important: It brought national attention to the Machiavellian tactics the GOP was employing to maintain its congressional majority in 2026,\" she writes.\n\n\"And that has resulted in a state-by-state battle that just may end up backfiring on the Republicans,\" she adds.\n\nPointing to the success of California Governor Gavin Newsom's (D) win on his redistricting efforts known as Prop. 50, Digby Parton notes, \"The risk paid off -- California's new map will effectively cancel out the five seats Texas added, and instead of being engineered in a backroom, it was done with the explicit approval of Californians.\"\n\nNewsom traveled to Texas to thank Democrats for their inspiration.\n\n\"You woke us up. You didn't just have your back here, you had our back in the state of California,\" he said.\n\nOther states are now following Newsom's lead, Digby Parton writes, with Democrats in Virginia, Illinois and Maryland signaling they are taking a look at their congressional maps.\n\n\"Republican-led states had been expected to immediately follow Texas' lead. But it's been a rockier road than they had hoped,\" she writes, citing a redrawn map in Ohio that may end up benefiting Democrats. As Parton notes, Kansas backed out of its effort to redraw maps, while Indiana and Missouri face challenges to theirs\n\nRepublicans are starting to get nervous, NBC reports, with a strategist explaining that, \"[T]he president understands intuitively, in a way that other Republicans don't ... that Democrats are always assaulting us, always, and mostly much of the Republican Party never fights back. The redistricting fight is proof that they are not that way. So this is in his DNA in a way that is not in other Republicans' DNA.\"\n\nDemocrats, meanwhile, are seeing positive signs for them in the redistricting fight. According to Dave Wasserman, an electoral expert at the nonpartisan Cook Political Report with Amy Walter, \"[b]etween Ohio, Kansas, California, Virginia and now this huge win in Utah, Democrats have quietly strung together an impressive streak of victories over the past few weeks that have, surprisingly, pushed the mid-decade redistricting war closer to a draw.\"\n\nDigby Parton notes that \"the Texas redistricting was largely based on the idea that Trump's 2024 win marked a massive, permanent shift of Latino voters to the GOP column,\" which proved untrue.\n\n\"Latino voters are not a monolith; there are regional and cultural differences. But the recent elections indicated large numbers in New York, New Jersey and Virginia had returned to the Democratic camp, a swing that could very well be equally reflected in Texas and any other state with a large Latino population,\" she writes.\n\nTexas Republicans were so sure of themselves, she says, that they \"indulged in what the political types call 'dummymandering' -- diluting some of their safe seats where Trump won by large margins to ones where he would have won by less, and leaving themselves vulnerable, in a wave election, to losing seats instead of gaining five.\"\n\nJohn Eakin, a Republican consultant and data scientist, told NBC News that some Republicans are regretting their overconfidence after Trump's 2024 victory.\n\nPointing to a recent result special election for a state Senate seat representing Dallas where the Democrat significantly over-performed the 2024 results, Republicans are starting to sweat.\n\n\"Nobody wants to go against Trump in this district map because they fear him,\" Eakin said. \"They've pushed the envelope and it's going to come back to bite them in the a -- -- .\"",

        "description": "Proposition 50 is aimed at countering Texas' new congressional map, which could help Republicans gain five additional seats in the House next year.\n\nThe Justice Department is suing over California's redistricting plan, which state voters overwhelmingly approved last week in an effort to redraw their congressional map in Democrats' favor.\n\nThe DOJ is joining an existing case brought by California Republicans against Proposition 50, which seeks to give Democrats five additional seats in the U.S. House ahead of the 2026 midterms. Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom had touted the measure as necessary to counter Texas' gerrymandering over the summer at President Donald Trump's request.\n\nCalling the California measure a \"power grab,\" U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi wrote on X on Thursday: \"Newsom should be concerned about keeping Californians safe and shutting down Antifa violence, not rigging his state for political gain.\"\n\nTrump had previously warned of legal action against California over Prop 50. After the measure passed, he called it a \"GIANT SCAM\" and claimed the vote was unconstitutional.\n\nIn August, however, the president celebrated the passage of Texas' redistricting plan, writing on Truth Social at the time that more seats for Republicans in the U.S. House \"equals less Crime, a great Economy, and a STRONG SECOND AMENDMENT.\"\n\nIn next year's midterms, Democrats will be seeking to retake control of the House in the hopes of more effectively opposing the Trump administration, while Republicans will be vying to hold on to their narrow majority.",

        "title": "Congress pushes hemp crackdown after pressure from states, marijuana industry",
        "description": "A provision significantly limiting the sale of intoxicating hemp products made its way into legislation to reopen the federal government just a day before the Senate approved the bill. Its inclusion follows years of pressure from states and the marijuana industry.\n\nWhile states continue to expand access to legal marijuana, a separate market of hemp-derived intoxicants has blossomed. The products, from drinks to gummies, are sold in gas stations and smoke shops. Critics say some companies have exploited a legal loophole from 2018 to manufacture products that get people high -- without the safety regulations and taxes facing the legal marijuana industry.\n\nThat's led dozens of states to limit or ban certain intoxicating hemp products. Most states also have pushed for federal changes, though some farm states worry the pending federal bill -- which the House is expected to vote on as soon as today -- goes too far.\n\nA bipartisan group of 39 state attorneys general recently urged Congress to clarify the federal definition of hemp, arguing that the underregulated industry threatens public health and undermines law enforcement.\n\nTexas lawmakers this year approved a strict ban on intoxicating hemp, but that measure was vetoed by Republican Gov. Greg Abbott. The governor raised constitutional concerns because federal law allowed the products, but he then issued an executive order increasing state agency regulations, including age restrictions.\n\nThis summer, Florida regulators seized tens of thousands of packages of hemp products that failed to meet new child protection standards, including child-resistant packaging, marketing restrictions and enhanced labeling rules. In Tallahassee, the state Senate approved a ban on hemp-derived THC products, including beverages, but that measure died in the state House. A similar effort last year was vetoed by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, who said it would harm small businesses.\n\nLast month, California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom signed legislation strengthening state enforcement of its ban on intoxicating hemp products. Similarly, Ohio Republican Gov. Mike DeWine declared an emergency last month in an executive order banning intoxicating hemp products for 90 days while lawmakers debate potential legislation.\n\nTetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, is the primary psychoactive component of the cannabis plant. The 39 state attorneys general argue manufacturers are manipulating hemp to produce synthetic THC that can be more intoxicating than marijuana.\n\n\"In this way, legal, nonintoxicating hemp is used to make Frankenstein THC products that get adults high and harm and even kill children,\" the attorneys general wrote.\n\nHemp-derived gummies and beverages are sold without consistent age restrictions or labeling regulations and oftentimes resemble candy. During his announcement, DeWine showcased brightly packaged intoxicating hemp products that resembled name-brand candy products.\n\n\"Certainly, it's easy to see how a child will confuse this product with real candy and eat a few gummy bears and ingest enough THC to require hospitalization,\" he said, according to the Ohio Capital Journal.\n\nThough it has faced mounting restrictions in the states, the hemp industry says the federal change poses an existential threat.\n\nOn Monday, the U.S. Hemp Roundtable said the legislation pending in Congress would wipe out 95% of the nation's $28.4 billion hemp industry.\n\n\"The language will force patients, seniors and veterans who rely on hemp products to break federal criminal law to acquire them,\" the trade group posted online.\n\nJonathan Miller, general counsel for the organization, said the industry has been pushing for regulation rather than outright prohibition. He acknowledged the problem of bad actors, but said those can be addressed with strong regulations like those that exist in Kentucky and Minnesota.\n\n\"These are good examples of states that have put together robust regulations. But we need to see that at the federal level, and we've been supporting legislation to do that for the last seven years,\" he told Stateline.\n\nRepublican U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell, Kentucky's senior senator, said he included the hemp measure in the bill to close an unintended legal loophole and that the measure would still allow farmers to grow hemp for fiber, oil and drug trials.\n\nBut fellow Kentucky Republican U.S. Sen. Rand Paul said the move would \"eradicate the hemp industry\" and could override some state laws. Paul offered an amendment to remove the hemp provision but failed.\n\nHemp derives from the same cannabis species as marijuana, but is legally defined by its lower levels of THC, the psychoactive component of the plant.\n\nWhile marijuana remains illegal under federal law, Congress sanctioned hemp in the 2018 farm bill to allow an agricultural market for hemp-based textiles, animal feeds and human wellness products centered on cannabidiol, or CBD, products. The farm bill allowed cultivation of hemp plants with a THC concentration of 0.3% or lower by dry weight.\n\nBut that threshold has become essentially meaningless, said Katharine Neill Harris, a fellow in drug policy at Rice University's Baker Institute for Public Policy.\n\nThat's because manufacturers have found ways to convert legal hemp plants into potent forms of synthetic marijuana. Aside from the potential of creating very strong products, she said the process requires the addition of solvents and other ingredients that raise many safety questions.\n\n\"With marijuana products, you can get some very potent products,\" she said. \"But the psychoactive components to THC are naturally occurring. It naturally occurs in that natural amount. You're not doing a whole bunch of manipulation to increase the potency of the product and adding ingredients.\"\n\nHarris has tracked the growing number of states regulating the industry: Six states and the District of Columbia now ban all consumable hemp products with any amount of THC. In 24 states, intoxicating hemp products are permitted, though 15 of those states allow only low-potency products.\n\nBut even states with strict regulations still must contend with legal online markets.\n\n\"There's a big part of that activity that you can't control as a state when something is federally legal, and so that's one thing that they're asking for is federal leadership on this issue,\" she said. \"I think there is a big demand for some sort of industry standards.\"\n\nIf approved by Congress and signed by the president, as expected, the new hemp legislation will likely have uneven impacts across the states.\n\nFor example, the change likely won't dramatically alter the legal landscape in Alaska, where the regulators have banned all intoxicating hemp products. Marijuana businesses complain those products are still being sold, despite the ban.\n\nBut in a state like Nebraska, where lawmakers have been unsuccessful in limiting intoxicating hemp, the change could drastically alter both consumer access and business sales, depending on enforcement.\n\nOn Monday, Paul said the federal legislation would wipe away hemp regulations in many states, including Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine and Utah.\n\n\"The bill before us nullifies all these state laws,\" he said.\n\nThe hemp industry has argued that a lot of the opposition to it stems from marijuana businesses looking to protect their own markets, noting that campaigns for restrictions are often more organized in states that have legalized marijuana.\n\nBut producers of intoxicating hemp are looking for market access without the associated safety regulations and tax structures states have created for marijuana, argued Chris Lindsey, the director of state advocacy and public policy at the American Trade Association for Cannabis and Hemp, an organization representing the legal marijuana industry.\n\n\"They want to have some kind of regulatory framework that's somehow different than the one that states already have [for marijuana],\" he said.\n\nHis organization cheered the Senate's efforts \"to address the dangerous proliferation of unregulated synthetic THC products.\"\n\nLindsey said hemp-derived products can contain contaminants, including pesticides. Many hemp products can be sourced cheaply overseas, he said, and with lax oversight, there is no system to recall tainted products here.\n\n\"To me, that's like running with knives,\" he told Stateline.\n\nThe Missouri Cannabis Trade Association recently purchased hemp products from gas stations and smoke shops from across the state to test them in an effort to show they need more regulation.\n\nIn its \"Missouri Hemp Hoax Report,\" the organization said independent testing found 53 of the 55 products purchased were actually intoxicating marijuana well above the legal limit of THC. Third-party lab results also showed some of the products contained pesticides and heavy metals.\n\nThose results underscore that the products should face the same rules as legal marijuana does, said Andrew Mullins, president and executive director of the cannabis trade association. State law requires marijuana to be grown and manufactured in Missouri, mandates lab testing and allows for sales only at licensed dispensaries.\n\n\"In my mind, if it's marijuana, which most of this is, then it should be regulated like marijuana,\" Mullins said.\n\nHe said calling the unregulated products \"hemp\" is akin to someone selling whiskey and calling it corn: \"Everybody is using hemp as a cover to basically sell intoxicating drugs.\"\n\nMullins acknowledged the confusion among policymakers and law enforcement. But he said there are already laws -- including those against trafficking marijuana without a license -- that could help address the issue.\n\nCatherine Hanaway, a Republican who was sworn in as Missouri's new attorney general in September, has vowed action on unregulated hemp products, particularly THC beverages that are booming in popularity.\n\n\"Our focus is on the health and safety of Missourians,\" James Lawson, her deputy chief of staff, told the Missouri Independent last month. \"This is an unregulated industry that makes untested, unknown substances available to the public without any oversight, including children where we think it's particularly detrimental.\"\n\nStateline reporter Kevin Hardy can be reached at khardy@stateline.org.\n\n\u00a92025 States Newsroom.

        "description": "The 'Common Sense' Department is wondering who told California Gov. Gavin Newsom he's some kind of world leader?\n\nA new documentary about the Palisades Fire of January shows California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass touring the Pacific Palisades as it burns behind them - with a contingent of Los Angeles Fire Department firefighters accompanying them instead of fighting the blaze.\n\nThe film, \"Paradise Abandoned,\" scheduled for release in December, is a reminder that the Palisades Fire will continue to haunt Bass as she seeks re-election - and Newsom as he seeks the presidency.\n\nNewsom addressed adoring crowds of Democrats in Houston over the weekend, even picking up a presidential endorsement or two, though he has not yet officially launched his campaign.\n\nHe is touting his success in passing Proposition 50 - which gerrymanders California's congressional districts for Democrats' benefit - as he casts himself as the leader of the party.\n\nMY HOUSE ALMOST BURNED DOWN IN THE PALISADES FIRE. ALLEGED ARSONIST IS NOT WHO I BLAME\n\nBut victims of wildfires back home are openly threatening to tank Newsom's political prospects unless he makes amends.\n\nAnd any change may already be too late for residents who have been forced to sell their lots because of a lack of support from the state.\n\n\"Paradise Abandoned\" claims authorities diverted firefighting resources during the fire, which burned over 36 square miles, destroyed nearly 7,000 structures and killed 12 people.\n\nIt notes that despite the fact that Pacific Palisades was situated in \"a region of maximum fire risk\" ahead of predicted extreme winds Jan. 7, not one additional fire truck was deployed to the area.\n\nResidents are shown having slipped past roadblocks on the second day of the still-burning fire to find out what happened to their homes.\n\nThey discover many have burned, with few firefighters in sight.\n\n\"The response is so f---ing minimal,\" one says.\n\nLA MAYOR BASS DELAYS PALISADES FIRE REPORT AT DOJ'S REQUEST AMID PROBE\n\nMeanwhile, the film notes, many fire trucks were stationed on the outer perimeter of the fire - or at a command post in a beach parking lot below the town, where they served as a backdrop for local officials to stage press conferences.\n\nOne resident recalls watching the Chase Bank building catch fire on the second day of the fire and burn completely through - while the governor and mayor toured the area.\n\n\"The mayor and the governor were in the middle of town, doing a news conference. And in the background, you see the Chase Bank building burning to the ground. They weren't doing anything. The whole thing just burned right to the ground, with the mayor and the governor within a block of the place.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nNewsom and Bass are seen flanked by firefighters.",

        "title": "Justice Dept. Joins Lawsuit to Challenge California's New Redistricting Maps",
        "description": "The U.S. Justice Department has joined a Republican lawsuit challenging new congressional maps that California voters approved last week to favor Democrats in next year's midterm elections.\n\nThe case asserts that the maps, which were championed by Gov. Gavin Newsom, are unconstitutional because they improperly use voters' race as a factor in determining district boundaries. It was filed last week by the California Republican Party, and on Thursday the Justice Department announced it had filed to intervene in the suit asking the courts to block the maps.\n\n\"California's redistricting scheme is a brazen power grab that tramples on civil rights and mocks the democratic process,\" Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement. \"Governor Newsom's attempt to entrench one-party rule and silence millions of Californians will not stand.\"\n\nIt's the latest development in what has become a nationwide battle between Republican- and Democratic-controlled states to draw new congressional maps that could determine which party wins control of the House of Representatives next year. President Trump set off the unusual frenzy over the summer when he pressured Texas officials to gerrymander that state's maps to help Republicans. In the months since then, moves to draw new congressional districts have swept the nation.\n\nThe new California maps would make it easier for Democrats to win as many as five of California's congressional seats that are now held by Republicans. Mr. Newsom, a Democrat, drafted the plan as a response to the scheme in Texas, where Republicans approved new congressional maps that aim to take five seats away from Democrats. The California redistricting plan went before the state's voters last week as Proposition 50, and passed overwhelmingly with 64 percent of the vote.\n\n\"These losers lost at the ballot box and soon they will also lose in court,\" Mr. Newsom's press office wrote on social media in response to the Justice Department's announcement that it had joined the Republican lawsuit.\n\nRepublicans sued over the maps the day after the election, arguing that drafters had engaged in racial gerrymandering by drawing districts to empower Latino voters. Lawyers for the California Republican Party said the suit was being paid for by the National Republican Congressional Committee, the political arm of House Republicans.\n\nOn Monday, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee intervened on the side of Mr. Newsom, arguing that the maps affect its ability to \"elect Democratic candidates in California's congressional districts and achieve a majority in the House of Representatives.\" The organization is represented by the law firm of Marc Elias, one of the Democratic Party's top election lawyers.\n\nThe Republicans' lawsuit was filed by attorneys who work for a firm founded by Harmeet K. Dhillon, a longtime Republican activist who was appointed by Mr. Trump to run the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division. Ms. Dhillon has been recused from the case, according to an announcement from the Justice Department.",

        "description": "U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi testifies before a Senate Judiciary Committee oversight hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., U.S., October 7, 2025. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst\n\nPresident Donald Trump's Justice Department is joining a last-ditch lawsuit in federal court to try to overturn Proposition 50 -- the recently passed ballot referendum in California that temporarily suspends the state's independent redistricting commission and passes a map that redraws five Republican seats to favor Democrats, to counteract Texas Republicans' plan that targets five Democratic seats there.\n\n\"California's redistricting scheme is a brazen power grab that tramples on civil rights and mocks the democratic process,\" said Attorney General Pam Bondi in a statement. \"Governor Newsom's attempt to entrench one-party rule and silence millions of Californians will not stand.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled in 2019 that because Congress has not passed a law regulating the issue, partisan gerrymandering cases are political questions that cannot be heard by federal courts. However, gerrymanders can still be struck down if they are found to illegally discriminate on a racial basis, although a Supreme Court case heard this term could potentially scale even this enforcement back considerably.\n\nThe lawsuit the DOJ joins, initially filed by the California Republican Party, argues that Proposition 50 racially gerrymandered seats to favor Hispanic voters.\n\nHowever, experts and observers on social media dismissed the suit as a meritless complaint that would go nowhere.\n\n\"Just like in the 2020 election, the GOP can't accept rejection,\" wrote Fox News' resident liberal commentator Jessica Tarlov.\n\n\".@AGPamBondi - fixed it for you. ''Texas's redistricting scheme is a brazen power grab that tramples on civil rights and mocks the democratic process,' Attorney General Pam Bondi said in an emailed statement. 'Governor Abbott's attempt to entrench one-party rule and silence millions of Texans will not stand,''\" wrote Texas congressional candidate Christian Menefee.\n\n\"The same Justice Department that *helped* Texas Republicans rig their congressional maps?\" wrote People For the American Way political director Markus Batchelor.\n\nCalifornia political commentator Vance Ulrich exposed how flimsy the lawsuit was, pointing out the Justice Department didn't even put the correct name for the California state legislature, calling it the \"California General Assembly.\"\n\n\"From the DOJ lawsuit against Prop 50: I've been following CA politics a long time, but I never realized the CA Legislature was a 'General Assembly.' This is not North Carolina. Not sending their best!\"\n\nMeanwhile, Gavin Newsom's press office had a simple retort: \"These losers lost at the ballot box and soon they will also lose in court.\"",

        "description": "A spokesperson for the governor, who is not accused of wrongdoing, said Dana Williamson was put on leave as soon as she said she was under investigation.\n\nThe California Democratic Party is reeling from the arrest of Gov. Gavin Newsom's former chief of staff in a corruption case involving a top aide to former Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra.\n\nNeither the term-limited governor nor Becerra, who is running to succeed Newsom, is accused of wrongdoing.\n\nBoth have spent the past day distancing themselves from the investigation into Dana Williamson, a longtime political strategist who was Newsom's chief of staff from early 2023 to November 2024, and Sean McCluskie, who was Becerra's chief of staff at HHS and his top deputy when Becerra was the state's attorney general.\n\nWilliamson was arrested on Wednesday in Sacramento on allegations of fraud, falsifying her tax returns and other charges, the most serious of which carry sentences of up to 20 years in prison. She pleaded not guilty and was released on a $500,000 bond.\n\nProsecutors allege in the 23-count indictment that Williamson conspired with McCluskie and others to divert roughly $225,000 from the dormant campaign account of \"Public Official 1,\" whom the indictment describes in terms that match Becerra, to McCluskie, disguising it as pay for work that never happened.\n\nWilliamson is also charged with falsifying and backdating contracts to justify Covid-era loans made to her business under the Paycheck Protection Program, claiming as tax deductions more than $1 million worth of personal expenses, including private jet travel, luxury hotel stays, designer handbags and cash payments to friends and family.\n\nMcCluskie recently entered into a plea agreement and agreed with the facts of the FBI's investigation. He faces up to five years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000, though he will likely receive lighter punishment because he is cooperating.\n\n\"Ms. Williamson no longer serves in this administration,\" a spokesperson for the governor said in a statement to MSNBC. \"While we are still learning details of the allegations, the Governor expects all public servants to uphold the highest standards of integrity.\"\n\nThe spokesperson said Williamson was placed on leave as soon as she informed the office last year she was under criminal investigation, adding that the alleged fraud did not take place while she served in the governor's office.\n\nBecerra said in a statement that the \"news of formal accusations of impropriety by a long-serving trusted advisor are a gut punch\" and added that he is voluntarily cooperating with the Justice Department in its investigation.",

        "title": "License expired: California revokes 17K commercial driver's licenses held by immigrants",
        "description": "California plans to revoke 17,000 commercial driver's licenses given to immigrants after discovering the expiration dates went past when the drivers were legally allowed to be in the U.S., state officials said Wednesday.\n\nThe announcement follows harsh criticism from the Trump administration about California and other states granting licenses to people in the country illegally. The issue was thrust into the public's consciousness in August, when a tractor-trailer driver not authorized to be in the U.S. made an illegal U-turn and caused a crash in Florida that killed three people.\n\nTransportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Wednesday that California's action to revoke these licenses is an admission that the state acted improperly even though it previously defended its licensing standards. California launched its review of commercial driver's licenses it issued after Duffy raised concerns.\n\n\"After weeks of claiming they did nothing wrong, Gavin Newsom and California have been caught red-handed. Now that we've exposed their lies, 17,000 illegally issued trucking licenses are being revoked,\" Duffy said, referring to the state's governor. \"This is just the tip of iceberg. My team will continue to force California to prove they have removed every illegal immigrant from behind the wheel of semitrucks and school buses.\"\n\nNewsom's office said that every one of the drivers whose license is being revoked had valid work authorizations from the federal government. At first, his office declined to disclose the exact reason for revoking the licenses, saying only they violated state law. Later, his office revealed the state law it was referring to was one that requires the licenses expire on or before a person's legal status to be in the United State ends, as reported to the DMV.\n\nStill, Newsom's spokesperson Brandon Richards shot back at Duffy in a statement.\n\n\"Once again, the Sean 'Road Rules' Duffy fails to share the truth -- spreading easily disproven falsehoods in a sad and desperate attempt to please his dear leader,\" Richards said.\n\nFatal truck crashes in Texas and Alabama earlier this year also highlight questions about these licenses. A fiery California crash that killed three people last month involved a truck driver in the country illegally, only adding to the concerns.\n\nDuffy previously imposed new restrictions on which immigrants can qualify for commercial driver's licenses. He said earlier this fall that California and five other states had improperly issued commercial driver's licenses to noncitizens, but California is the only state Duffy has taken action against because it was the first one where an audit was completed. The reviews in the other states have been delayed by the government shutdown, but the Transportation Department is urging all of them to tighten their standards.",

Gavin Newsom that is challenging California's efforts to redraw the state's congressional map in time for the next election.\n\nDOJ Civil Rights Division lawyers argued in a complaint that race was \"used as a proxy\" in California to justify creating districts favorable to Democrats, a move that served to offset the redistricting showdown in Texas that resulted in more Republican-leaning districts.\n\n\"In the press, California's legislators and governor sold a plan to promote the interests of Democrats in the upcoming midterm elections,\" the DOJ lawyers wrote. \"But amongst themselves and on the debate floor, the focus was not partisanship, but race.\"\n\nCALIFORNIA REPUBLICANS SUE TO STOP NEWSOM, DEMOCRATS FROM PUSHING REDISTRICTING PLAN\n\nThey added the Constitution \"does not tolerate this racial gerrymander\" and cited several remarks from lawmakers and others involved in the process about how they prioritized creating a Latino-majority district to counter Texas' perceived attempt to \"silence the voices of Latino voters.\"\n\nThe federal government has authority to enforce the Voting Rights Act, which has a provision designed to make sure voters are not disenfranchised based on their race. But the law's language has long been a point of controversy and is now under review by the Supreme Court in a separate redistricting case about Louisiana's map.\n\nCalifornia's ballot measure, called Proposition 50, passed on Election Day, and clears the way for the state legislature to redraw districts that could flip five Republican seats. Newsom said in celebratory remarks after the measure's passage that it was California's answer to Trump \"trying to rig the midterm elections before one single vote is even cast.\"\n\n'DERANGED OBSESSION': NEWSOM HIT WITH LAWSUIT OVER 'RETALIATORY' CALIFORNIA REDISTRICTING PUSH\n\n\"One thing he never counted on, though, was the state of California,\" Newsom said. \"Instead of agonizing over the state of our nation. We organized in an unprecedented way, in a 90-day sprint.\"\n\nCalifornia Assembly member David Tangipa, a Republican, responded by suing, and the DOJ joined in that lawsuit Thursday.\n\nA spokesperson for Newsom told Fox News Digital: \"These losers lost at the ballot box and soon they will also lose in court.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe legal battle comes as redistricting fights have intensified in the lead-up to the 2026 midterm elections. In addition to Texas and California, Louisiana's fight before the Supreme Court could affect its map by the next election, depending on when the high court rules. In Utah, Republicans were just dealt a blow by a state judge who approved a new map that will tip one of the state's four districts in favor of Democrats.",

Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., is eyeing a new workplace: the California governor's mansion.\n\nAccording to two sources familiar with the matter who were granted anonymity to discuss the congressman's private plans, Swalwell has all but decided he is running for governor, with one of the sources saying he has even been discussing an announcement as early as next week.\n\nSwalwell declined to comment when reached by MSNBC, but a source close to the congressman, who asked to remain anonymous to discuss the private discussions, said Swalwell allies had asked him to run \"to fill a 'fighter/protector' role\" in the mold of Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom.\n\nThe news about Swalwell comes days after Sen. Alex Padilla, D-Calif., announced he would not run for governor, with Newsom vacating the position because he is term-limited after eight years.\n\nPadilla, who previously served as California's secretary of state, said he would stay put in the Senate rather than jump to the governor's race. But that doesn't mean the election won't be crowded.\n\nFormer Rep. Katie Porter, D-Calif., and former Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra -- who was also a longtime congressman -- have already announced. Former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and businessman Stephen Cloobeck, the founder of the timeshare company Diamond Resorts, are also running.\n\nA gubernatorial bid would not be Swalwell's first run for higher office. The congressman entered the Democratic primary for president in 2020 but dropped out months before the caucuses in Iowa -- the state where he was born.\n\nThe governor's mansion would give Swalwell yet another platform to go after President Donald Trump -- a frequent adversary of his, since Swalwell has also been one of Trump's favorite political targets.\n\nEarlier on Thursday, a Trump administration official referred the congressman to the Department of Justice for a potential federal criminal investigation over allegations of mortgage and tax fraud, according to NBC News.\n\nSwalwell quickly put out a statement chastising Trump for initiating what he characterized as a political investigation.\n\n\"As the most vocal critic of Donald Trump over the last decade and as the only person who still has a surviving lawsuit against him, the only thing I am surprised about is that it took him this long to come after me,\" Swalwell said.\n\nSwalwell has made a name for himself by attacking Trump. But he's also increased his profile over the attacks and controversies he's survived.\n\nConservatives have mercilessly gone after Swalwell for his ties to an alleged Chinese spy, Fang Fang, who was reportedly cultivating relationships with California politicians for years. Swalwell denies any improper relationship or actions with Fang Fang and has presented himself as a target of the Chinese government.",

        "description": "California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D). Nearly 65 percent of California voters approved a ballot measure this month that redraws the state's congressional map. (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)\n\nThe Justice Department on Thursday joined a lawsuit seeking to block California's new congressional map, the latest chapter in a nationwide redistricting battle sparked by President Donald Trump's push for red states to add more Republican-leaning districts ahead of next year's midterm elections.\n\nCalifornia's new congressional map was implemented via ballot measure during the Nov. 4 election, gaining the approval of nearly 65 percent of California voters. The measure allows Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) to circumvent the state's nonpartisan redistricting commission to redraw the map for three elections but returns redistricting authority to the commission after the 2030 Census.\n\n\"Newsom should be concerned about keeping Californians safe and shutting down Antifa violence, not rigging his state for political gain,\" Attorney General Pam Bondi wrote in a post on X.\n\nThe Justice Department is joining a suit filed in federal court this month by California Assembly member David Tangipa (R), who alleged in his filing that the new congressional map, which adds five more Democratic-leaning districts, violates the 14th and 15th Amendments' protections against racial gerrymandering.\n\nBondi filed a motion to join the case Thursday, asserting that the case is \"of general public importance.\" The Justice Department declined to comment on the suit. Representatives for Newsom didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nNewsom and Democrats in California's legislature set out to redistrict to counteract Texas's new congressional map, drawn at Trump's behest to try to shore up or expand Republicans' narrow House majority next year. In addition to Texas, which approved its new map in August, the GOP has drawn new maps in Missouri, North Carolina and Ohio. Democrats have kicked off a months-long process to draw a new Virginia congressional map and are trying to block the Missouri map from taking effect.\n\nOther states are discussing redistricting, but The Washington Post previously reported some Republican resistance to those efforts in Indiana and Kansas, while some Democrats have pushed back against new maps in Illinois and Maryland.",

        "description": "Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier joins 'Fox & Friends' to discuss reports that California issued trucking licenses to illegal immigrants and how Florida plans to respond.\n\nCalifornia is set to revoke commercial driver's licenses (CDLs) issued to 17,000 immigrants after pressure from the Trump administration.\n\nThe licenses that are expected to be revoked would have expired after the driver was legally allowed to be in the country.\n\n\"After weeks of claiming they did nothing wrong, Gavin Newsom and California have been caught red-handed. Now that we've exposed their lies, 17,000 illegally issued trucking licenses are being revoked,\" Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a statement. \"This is just the tip of the iceberg. My team will continue to force California to prove they have removed every illegal immigrant from behind the wheel of semi-trucks and school buses.\"\n\nThe Transportation Department said that those impacted by the decision have been notified that their licenses no longer meet federal requirements and will expire in 60 days. However, California Gov. Gavin Newsom's office said in a post on X that the federal requirements referenced were not in effect when the licenses were issued.\n\nEXPERT REVEALS HOW ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT TRUCKER MAY HAVE GOTTEN COMMERCIAL LICENSE BEFORE FATAL FLORIDA CRASH\n\nIn the scathing social media post, Newsom's office slammed Duffy over the Transportation Department's statement on the matter, highlighting each point that it deemed to be a \"lie.\"\n\nThe first point that Newsom's office pushed back on was the department's assertion that the California Department of Motor Vehicles \"admitted to illegally issuing\" the 17,000 CDLs in question. Newsom's office claims that the licenses were withdrawn because they were inconsistent with California law.\n\nNewsom's office also rejected the department's statement that the drivers who received the licenses were illegal immigrants, saying that they were present in the U.S. legally and \"had been granted work authorization by the federal government.\"\n\nAdditionally, Newsom's office disputed the claim that the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration's (FMCSA) analysis showed that \"more than one in four of the non-domiciled CDL records sampled in California failed to comply with federal regulations.\" The California governor's office claimed that FMCSA's analysis was \"based on retroactive application of its new rules\" and said \"FMCSA also faults California for following guidance explicitly approved by DHS.\"\n\nDuffy, however, hit back, saying, \"We've said all along, [DOT] is reprimanding California for violating [FMCSA's] ORIGINAL rules.\"\n\n\"My emergency rule came as a consequence in part for California's total disregard of those federal laws -- it was THAT BAD,\" Duffy added.\n\nBLUE STATES DEFLECT BLAME IN TRUMP PROBE AFTER ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT TRUCKER CRASH KILLS 3 IN FLORIDA\n\nCalifornia's move to revoke the licenses came just one day before Harjinder Singh, who crossed into the United States illegally in 2018 and is accused of causing a fatal accident that left three people dead, faced a docket call hearing as the court reviews discovery issues and interpreter concerns.\n\nSingh was charged with three counts of vehicular homicide after he allegedly attempted to make an illegal U-turn through an \"Official Use Only\" access point in Fort Pierce, Fla. When making the turn, Singh allegedly caused what Homeland Security called a \"brutal wreck.\" In August, Singh was extradited from California to Florida, where the accident took place.\n\nJust days after the accident, officials investigating the wreck said that Singh failed English and road sign tests.\n\nBLUE STATE INVESTIGATES HOW ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT TRUCKER GOT LICENSE BEFORE DEADLY FLORIDA CRASH\n\n\"During [FMCSA's] interview with the driver, investigators administered an English Language Proficiency (ELP) assessment in accordance with FMCSA guidance,\" the Department of Transportation said in a statement. \"The driver failed the assessment, providing correct responses to just 2 of 12 verbal questions and only accurately identifying 1 of 4 highway traffic signs.\"\n\nIn another instance, Jashanpreet Singh, an illegal immigrant from India who received a CDL from California, was charged with vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated and driving under the influence after allegedly driving while intoxicated and causing a crash that left three people dead.\n\nMultiple federal law enforcement sources told Fox News that Singh was first encountered by Border Patrol agents in California's El Centro Sector in March 2022 and released into the interior of the country pending an immigration hearing.\n\nCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nPolice say Singh never hit the brakes before slamming into the traffic jam, citing toxicology tests that confirmed impairment.\n\nFox News Digital's Peter D'Abrosca and Jasmine Baehr and Fox News' Bill Melugin contributed to this report.",

Gavin Newsom and fellow Democrats, who control the state, drew the map to cut Republicans' share of the congressional delegation from nine down to four seats, out of 52.\n\nBut the legislature, which drew up the map and put it to voters in a referendum last week, cast the debate as one of racial representation as much as political parties, the Justice Department said. The result was a map that took pains to carve out Hispanic-heavy districts to counter Texas, which earlier this year redistricted away several majority-minority districts in its state.\n\nThe Justice Department said that focusing on race makes the maps invalid.\n\n\"Our Constitution does not tolerate this racial gerrymander,\" the department said in its intervening complaint.\n\nIt asked the federal court in Los Angeles to block the use of the maps for next year's election and into the future.\n\nThe department's lawyers pointed to one newly drawn district that was crafted to snare Hispanic voters, including Republican areas, while leaving White Democrats out.\n\nThey said if the goal was purely party politics, those White Democrats would have been roped into the same district with the Hispanic voters, and the Hispanic GOP areas would have been left out.\n\nThe referendum to adopt the new map won easily, with roughly 65% of the vote.",

        "description": "Florida Governor Ron DeSantis weighs in on the petition in support of the illegal alien trucker accused of killing three and California Governor Gavin Newsom's 'tough guy' act on 'Hannity.'\n\nAn illegal alien truck driver accused of causing a crash in Florida that killed three people appeared in court Thursday as his attorneys pressed for new testing of evidence before trial.\n\nHarjinder Singh, 28, of India, faces multiple felony counts for allegedly causing a fiery semi-truck crash that killed three people in Fort Pierce, Florida in August.\n\nSingh, who crossed into the United States illegally in 2018 via the southern border, has been charged with three counts of vehicular homicide and was extradited to Florida to face charges after traveling to California in the aftermath of the crash.\n\nHe appeared via video conference from jail for a docket call before Judge Lawrence Mirman in St. Lucie Courthouse in Florida on Thursday at 10:30 a.m.\n\nBODYCAM VIDEO SHOWS ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT TRUCK DRIVER SPEAKING LIMITED ENGLISH WITH NEW MEXICO OFFICER\n\nDefense attorneys requested that Singh's blood samples be released for independent analysis and asked for access to inspect the vehicles involved before they are released from law enforcement custody. Prosecutors did not object, and both sides told the court they expect those steps to be completed before the end of the year.\n\nThe defense also requested a continuance to allow more time to review discovery materials, which the judge granted. The next jury docket call is now scheduled for Jan. 15, 2026, with the case continuing toward trial.\n\nSingh's attorney told the court that his client is indigent but has received some third-party assistance to fund the defense. Mirman explained the process for requesting an indigency declaration \"for cost\" despite Singh retaining private counsel.\n\nThe defense asked that Singh be allowed to appear virtually for the next docket call, though Mirman said another judge will preside that day and will determine whether virtual appearances are permitted. Singh confirmed through an interpreter that he understood the proceedings.\n\nEXPERT REVEALS HOW ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT TRUCKER MAY HAVE GOTTEN COMMERCIAL LICENSE BEFORE FATAL FLORIDA CRASH\n\nFox News previously reported, citing a senior official with the Florida Attorney General's Office, that Singh failed his commercial driver's license (CDL) test 10 times in two months before finally receiving a license in 2023 in Washington state.\n\nInvestigators with the Florida AG's office learned Singh failed his CDL knowledge exam in Washington state 10 times between March 10, 2023, and May 5, 2023. They also learned he failed his air brakes knowledge exam twice.\n\nThe Washington company that trained Singh for his CDL attested that he could speak English, even though he struggled to speak it proficiently, the senior official said. Still, Washington issued Singh his first CDL, and California later granted him another.\n\nBodycam video released in August shows Singh struggling with limited English after being pulled over for speeding in New Mexico a month earlier, a detail that has become a major focal point in the case.\n\nThe footage shows Singh being stopped by a New Mexico State Police officer on July 3 for allegedly driving 60 mph in a 45 mph zone. Singh appeared apologetic as he received a ticket. He communicated clearly at first, but after signing paperwork and preparing to leave, the officer struggled to understand him.\n\nOfficials investigating the wreck in Florida said Singh failed English and road sign tests. He's accused of jackknifing his 18-wheeler during an illegal U-turn, causing a van to smash into the side of the semi, leaving three people dead.\n\nWATCH: Florida AG slams California over alleged illegal migrant trucker licenses after deadly crash\n\nTransportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Oct. 15 that many big rig drivers fail to meet English language requirements, a problem his department is now targeting.\n\n\"I put states on notice this summer: Enforce the Trump Administration's English language requirements or the checks stop coming,\" Duffy said. \"California is the only state in the nation that refuses to ensure big rig drivers can read our road signs and communicate with law enforcement. This is a fundamental safety issue that impacts you and your family on America's road.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe announcement followed the Trump administration's decision to withhold more than $40 million in federal highway safety funds from California for failing to enforce federal English proficiency standards for truckers.",

Gavin Newsom announced on Thursday that emergency resources will be pre-deployed ahead of the storm to protect communities in the Los Angeles, Orange and Ventura counties from mudslides and debris flow.\n\nThis storm -- which is a moderate atmospheric river building along a cold front -- will begin to hit areas of Northern and Central California, Washington and Oregon on Thursday before slamming parts of Southern California.\n\nHeavy rain will push through the Bay Area and Sacramento on Thursday morning, bringing up to 4 inches of rain in some areas, before traveling south to Los Angeles late Thursday into Friday morning.\n\nRain, heavy at times, will continue across Southern California on Friday and Saturday, with 1 to 3 inches of rain expected across much of Western California -- although some localized areas at higher elevation could receive more.\n\nOver just two days, Friday and Saturday, higher elevations around Santa Barbara could see 4 to 6 inches of rain, bringing the threat of rockslides, landslides and debris flow through the weekend and into next week as more rain continues over these saturated soils.\n\nThis system will also force below-average temperatures over Southern California, with scattered showers remaining a possibility on Sunday through at least Tuesday.\n\nThe Los Angeles County Fire Department said anyone living in burned or flood-prone areas should \"stay away from flood channels, catch basins, canyons and waterways which are vulnerable to floods\" and if people have to evacuate, to \"return to your home only after local authorities have said it is safe to do so.\"\n\nThe evacuation warnings in Southern California will be in effect through Sunday, officials said.",

        "title": "Newsom vows to block Trump's reported energy plan in California, experts push back",
        "description": "'Outnumbered' reacts to California Gov. Gavin Newsom's criticisms of his own party for walking away from America's masculinity crisis.\n\nCalifornia Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom vowed this week that he would stop a reported Trump administration effort to unleash energy production off California's coast in a social media post that was widely criticized by conservatives and experts who spoke to Fox News Digital.\n\n\"Dead on arrival,\" Newsom said in a post on X on Tuesday in response to a Washington Post article reporting that Trump officials are mulling plans to propose oil drilling off California's coast \"for the first time in decades.\"\n\nNewsom's post, viewed over 3 million times, drew quick pushback from conservatives.\n\n\"Dead on arrival\" is what @GavinNewsom says about Trump proposal to drill offshore California,\" ophthalmologist and commentator Houman David Hemmati posted on X.\n\nFETTERMAN FIRES BACK AT NEWSOM AFTER SHUTDOWN CRITICISM, REFUSES TO 'PLAY CHICKEN' WITH THE LIVES OF AMERICANS\n\n\"The SAME man who's been pushing for overpriced, unreliable, environmentally catastrophic offshore wind.\"\n\nGabriella Hoffman, director of the Independent Women's Forum Center for Energy and Conservation, told Fox News Digital that new offshore oil and gas projects \"should be explored in California\" and that the projects are \"safe\" and \"have a minimal environmental footprint due to improved technology and increased safety measures.\"\n\n\"California is considered an oil island, despite having plentiful onshore and offshore recoverable oil reserves,\" Hoffman said. \"Governor Newsom purports to hate oil and gas, yet 60% of California's petroleum is imported from foreign nations including Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Brazil, and Guyana. That's unsettling, but a natural consequence of forcing a 100% transition to renewables.\"\n\nNewsom was the most prominent American official to attend the COP30 global climate conference in Bel\u00e9m, Brazil, this week -- using the platform to criticize the absent Trump administration.\n\nThe White House mocked the trip, noting California's continued rank among the highest in U.S. energy costs.\n\n3 REASONS CALIFORNIA'S GREEN ENERGY CAMPAIGN IS DYING ON THE VINE\n\nIn a statement to Fox News Digital, a spokesperson for Newsom's office said, \"The Trump administration has yet to formally share with us their plan, but expensive and riskier offshore drilling would put our communities at risk and undermine the economic stability of our coastal economies. Given recent history, we're not surprised by the lack of communication or their lack of thought into how their actions will impact Americans. The Trump administration's focus continues to be on the next grift, and not the well-being of our people and communities.\"\n\nNewsom's office put out a summary of his visit to the conference, saying it shows California is \"leading by example\" and proving that \"climate action and economic growth go hand in hand.\"\n\nHoffman told Fox News Digital that while every energy project has \"environmental trade-offs,\" Newsom's climate agenda has resulted in renewables getting \"a pass.\"\n\n\"Governor Newsom desires to litter my home state's coastline with offshore wind farms that are eyesores, produce expensive unreliable electricity, and threaten fish and marine mammals,\" Hoffman said. \"Once decommissioned, oil rigs are converted to sanctuaries under the 'rigs to reef' program to support marine life -- including endangered fish species -- with habitat. Former Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger wisely laid the groundwork for this conservation program in 2010 when he signed AB 2503 into law.\"\n\nMark Bednar, former communications director for Speaker Kevin McCarthy, told Fox News Digital that the Trump administration is focused on \"expanding America's energy dominance through further exploration\" and cautioned Newsom on being out of step with that.\n\n\"Right now, adversaries like Russia, China, Venezuela, and Iran are working around the clock to expand their economic and geopolitical footholds, and any American lawmaker who opposes moves to grow America's energy dominance will have a hard time explaining to the American people why unilaterally tying one arm behind our back is good for America,\" Bednar said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nUltimately, Newsom's climate policies, according to Hoffman, \"invited energy scarcity in the Golden State.\"\n\n\"California has the second-highest electricity rates after Hawaii. Californians also pay the highest gas tax rate of any U.S. state,\" Hoffman said. \"If two oil refineries close by 2026, California residents will soon pay $8 per gallon at the gas pump. That's unsustainable.\n\n\"California's energy crisis is entirely self-inflicted. New offshore oil and gas projects, along with new nuclear, geothermal, and natural gas, can reduce energy prices and make the Golden State energy independent once again.\"\n\nFox News Digital reached out to the Department of Interior for comment.",

        "title": "Building more apartments near public transit can help address the housing crisis and climate change",
        "description": "BOSTON -- After years of living on the street and crashing on friends' couches, Quantavia Smith was given the keys to a studio apartment in Los Angeles that came with an important perk - easy access to public transit.\n\nThe 38-year-old feels like she went from a life where \"no one cares\" to one where she has a safe place to begin rebuilding her life. And the metro station the apartment complex was literally built upon is a lifeline as she searches for work without a car.\n\n\"It is more a sense of relief, a sense of independence,\" said Smith, who moved in July. She receives some government assistance and pays 30% of her income for rent - just $19 a month for an efficiency with a full-market value of $2,000.\n\n\"Having your own space, you feel like you can do anything.\"\n\nMetro areas from Los Angeles to Boston have taken the lead in tying new housing developments to their proximity to public transit, often teaming up with developers to streamline the permitting process and passing policies that promote developments that include a greater number of units.\n\nCity officials argue building housing near public transit helps energize neglected neighborhoods and provide affordable housing, while ensuring a steady stream of riders for transit systems and cutting greenhouse gas emissions by reducing the number of cars on the road.\n\n\"Transit-oriented development should be one of, if not the biggest solution that we're looking at for housing development,\" said Yonah Freemark, research director at the Urban Institute's Land Use Lab, who has written extensively on the topic.\n\n\"It takes advantage of all of this money we've spent on transportation infrastructure. If you build the projects and don't build anything around the areas near them, then it's kind of like money thrown down the drain,\" Freemark said.\n\nThe Santa Monica and Vermont Apartments where Smith lives is part of an ambitious plan by the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority to build 10,000 housing units near transit sites by 2031 - offering developers land discounts in exchange for affordable housing development and other community benefits.\n\nIn Washington D.C., the transit authority has completed eight projects since 2022 that provided nearly 1,500 apartments and a million square feet of office space. About half were in partnership with Amazon, which committed $3.6 billion in low-cost loans and grants for affordable housing projects in Washington, as well as Nashville, Tennessee, and the Puget Sound area in Washington state. Almost all are within a half-mile of public transit.\n\n\"Big cities face the greatest challenges when it comes to traffic congestion and high housing costs,\" Freemark said. \"Building new homes near transit helps address both problems by encouraging people to take transit while increasing housing supply.\"\n\nAmong projects Boston has built, the Pok Oi Residents in Chinatown is a 10-minute walk to the subway and a half-dozen bus stops. That's a draw for Bernie Hernandez, who moved his family there from a Connecticut suburb after his daughter got into a Boston university.\n\n\"The big difference is commuting. You don't need a car,\" said Hernandez, who said he can walk to the grocery story and pharmacy. His 17-year-old daughter takes the subway to school. Now, his car mostly sits idle, saving him money on gas and time spent in traffic.\n\n\"You get to go to different places very quickly. Everything is convenient,\" Hernandez said.\n\nStates from Massachusetts to California are passing laws targeting restrictive zoning regulations that for decades prohibited building multifamily developments and contributed to housing shortages.\n\nLast month, California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a state law allowing taller apartment buildings on land owned by transit agencies and near bus, train and subway lines.\n\n\"Building more homes in our most sustainable locations is the key to tackling the affordability crisis and locking in California's success for many years to come,\" said State Sen. Scott Wiener, a Democrat who authored the bill.\n\nCalifornia joins Colorado, which requires cities to allow an average of 40 housing units per acre within a quarter-mile of transit, and Utah, which mandates about 50 units per acre. In Washington, the governor signed a bill this year allowing taller housing developments in mixed-use commercial zones near transit.\n\n\"We want to ensure that there are mixed-income, walkable, vibrant homes all around those transit investments and that people have the option of using cars less to improve the environmental health of our communities,\" said Democratic Rep. Julia Reed, who authored the Washington bill.\n\n\"It's about giving people the opportunity to drive less and live more.\"\n\nMassachusetts Democratic Gov. Maura Healey has made housing a priority.\n\nAmong her most potent tools is a 2021 law that requires 177 towns or communities nearby to create zoning districts allowing multi-family housing. The state provided nearly $8 million to more than 150 communities to help create these zones, while threatening to cut funding for those that don't. More than 6,000 housing units are in development as a result.\n\n\"You put housing nearby public transit\" Healey said. \"It's great for people. They can literally get up, leave their home, walk to a commuter rail and get to work.\"\n\nAmong the first to comply was Lexington, which has approved 10 projects, including a $115 million complex with 187 housing units and retail space.\n\nWalking past earth-moving equipment and dump trucks at the construction site earlier this year, project manager Quinlan Locke said: \"This is a landscape yard. It's commercial. It's meant for trucking.\"\n\nBut, he added, in \"two years from now, it's going to be meant for people who live here, work here and play here. This is going to become someone's home.\"\n\nSome advocates argue the lofty goals of transit housing are falling short due to fierce local resistance and lack of funding and support at the federal and state levels.\n\nHigher mortgage interest rates, more government red tape, rising construction costs and lack of investment at transit stations also have contributed to a troubling trend - nine times more housing units built far from public transit versus near it in the past two decades, according to a 2023 Urban Institute study.\n\nIn Massachusetts, 19 communities still haven't created new zones. Some unsuccessfully sued the state to halt the law, while residents rejected new zones in others. Lexington eventually shrank its zone from 227 acres to 90 acres after residents complained.\n\n\"If we allow the state to come in and dictate how we zone, what else are they going to come in and dictate?\" said Anthony Renzoni, a selectman from the town of Holden, which sued the state and is drawing up a new zoning map after residents rejected the first one.\n\nIn Los Angeles, the six-story complex where Smith lives in East Hollywood is home to 300 new residents since opening in February. It's revitalizing the area around the metro site, with a Filipino grocery, medical clinic and farmers market opening early next year.\n\nHalf the 187 units are reserved for formerly homeless residents like Smith, who had been living in a rundown motel paid for with a voucher and before that on the street. She's been assigned a case worker and is getting help with basic life skills, budgeting and finding work.\n\nEqually important: Smith, who can't afford a car, doesn't need one.\n\n\"I'm very very fortunate to be somewhere where the transit takes me where I want to go,\" she said. \"Where I want to go is not that far.\"",

        "title": "This Democrat from a red state could help his party reclaim the House",
        "description": "Ben McAdams, who served one term in Congress during President Donald Trump's first term, plans to announce Thursday that he is running for a new Democratic-leaning House seat in Utah, he said in an interview.\n\nThe seat was created amid a national redistricting fight after a state judge this month rejected a congressional map drawn by Republicans and adopted an alternate proposal. Republicans nationally hold a narrow 219-214 majority, making every seat crucial.\n\nUtah has not had a Democratic member of Congress since 2021, after McAdams lost his seat -- which at the time represented a conservative district -- after he voted to impeach Trump. Republicans hold all four of its congressional seats.\n\nBut McAdams will now run in a solidly Democratic district. Judge Dianna Gibson ruled this week that the map advanced by Republicans, which was designed to protect all four seats, \"unduly favors Republicans and disfavors Democrats.\" Gibson ultimately selected a map that keeps almost all of Salt Lake County -- which is heavily Democratic -- in one district rather than divided among multiple districts.\n\nGibson's ruling added a critical seat for Democrats as they work to counter an unprecedented Republican effort -- pushed by Trump -- to redraw maps in their states mid-cycle to maintain their House majority. The party out of power typically holds an advantage in midterm elections.\n\nThe redistricting effort began when Trump urged Texas's Republican governor, Greg Abbott, to redraw his state's map to gain five more Republican-leaning seats. California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) led a successful effort this month to win voter support for new maps that would add five safer Democratic seats. Republicans hold an advantage in drawing maps because they control more states.\n\nMcAdams previously served as mayor of Salt Lake County and in the Utah state Senate before being elected to a single congressional term in 2018. He was raised by a single mom who brought up six kids and lived paycheck to paycheck and is focused on making life more affordable for low-income and working-class families, he said.\n\n\"Washington seems to have forgotten about families like mine. They've forgotten what real life is like,\" McAdams said in an interview. \"Instead of feeding kids, we're working to deny SNAP benefits and health care subsidies that are so important to people's ability to access health care, and I think it's cruel.\"\n\nMcAdams was referring to the Trump administration's multiple appeals -- including to the Supreme Court -- during the more than 40-day government shutdown to not have to pay full food assistance benefits to millions of Americans despite lower court orders. He was also referencing Democrats' demand during the shutdown that an extension of pandemic-era health subsidies to help people buy health insurance on the Obamacare individual marketplace be part of any funding package. Republican lawmakers and a handful of Democrats voted to end the shutdown without extending the subsidies.\n\nMcAdams said he has grown distressed by the progression of Trump's second term, including Trump's decision to send the National Guard into Democratic-led cities; reports of immigrants being whisked off the street and deported without due process; and his erosion of democratic norms and institutions.\n\n\"It feels like in the blink of an eye, Donald Trump has taken our democracy and trampled all over it,\" McAdams said. \"Many Republicans are his accomplices but I see too many Democrats aren't doing enough to stop it.\"\n\nMcAdams declined to say whether he would support House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-New York) as the party's leader if Democrats retake control of the House.\n\n\"We shouldn't be fighting for the sake of fighting. Democrats need to be fighting to deliver results for American families,\" McAdams said.",

        "title": "Epstein's Emails",
        "description": "Congress released new files from the Epstein investigation. We explain what they mean.\n\nIn death, Jeffrey Epstein became a permanent feature of American political life.\n\nIn life, the financier eventually charged with trafficking girls hosted parties for rich and powerful people. President Trump socialized with him and sent him a bespoke birthday greeting shaped like a naked lady. (Trump denies he made it.) Many liberal luminaries were in Epstein's orbit, too.\n\nA curious nation wondered why. What did Epstein offer them? Did he have anything on them? Now majorities in both parties think there must be ... something. A majority in the House of Representatives wants whatever it is to come out.\n\nEvery now and then, nuggets of news emerge. In July, the Justice Department put out a report saying there was no Epstein \"client list.\" The Times reported this past summer about his Manhattan lair and this fall about the bankers who served him after he'd been convicted of a sex crime.\n\nAnd yesterday, Democrats released three emails in which Epstein talked with others about Trump, suggesting the president may know more about the sex trafficking than he has acknowledged. Hours later, Republicans dropped 23,000 more pages of documents from Epstein's estate. It led to a mad scramble in our newsroom.\n\nA day of revelations\n\nRepublicans released the documents around 10:30 a.m. They weren't in chronological or sequential order, and exchanges between people were frequently not located together. They were a mess.\n\nTop editors in Washington and New York, including Kirsten Danis, the editor who runs our investigative team, launched journalists at the cache. They searched the haystack for needles, pulling out what seemed most interesting and important. Engineers and experts in artificial intelligence downloaded the documents to make them searchable. Visual journalists and designers brought them to life.\n\n(How do we use artificial intelligence in our journalism? You can read about our approach here, but Zach Seward, the editor in charge of our A.I. efforts, gave me great examples from yesterday. When reporters find a document that's interesting in a collection of them, he told me, we can use A.I. to find more like it. We can also use a \"semantic search\" to find passages that are similar in meaning to snippets elsewhere, even when they don't have the same keywords in them. That's helpful when you're looking at 23,000 pages of documents and don't have a lot of time.)\n\n\"We still have a lot to look at and don't totally know how much of the universe we have seen,\" Kirsten said. But here's some of what the emails have revealed so far. Please note: The documents are riddled with typos, which we have preserved when we quote from them.\n\n1. Epstein's emails suggest he was close with Trump.\n\n* In 2011, in an email to his associate Ghislaine Maxwell, he wrote: \"i want you to realize that that dog that hasn't barked is trump. [Redacted victim name] spent hours at my house with him ,, he has never once been mentioned.\"\n\n* People repeatedly emailed Epstein asking for advice in dealing with Trump, but he wasn't always forthcoming. In one email, Epstein advised: \"donald is close to no one. . he talks to many people. he tells each one something differnt.\"\n\n* In an email to the author Michael Wolff in 2019, Epstein wrote of Trump, \"of course he knew about the girls as he asked ghislaine to stop.\"\n\n2. But Epstein also frequently disparaged Trump.\n\n* In 2018, during Trump's first impeachment inquiry, Epstein wrote, \"you see, i know how dirty donald is.\"\n\n* When a former Obama administration official emailed Epstein and called Trump \"so gross,\" Epstein replied, \"worse in real life and upclose.\"\n\n3. Wolff seems to have served as an adviser to Epstein.\n\n* Some of Wolff's emails suggest that Epstein could have contradicted Trump's claims -- or held back in exchange for a favor. In 2015, before a presidential debate on CNN, Epstein asked what they would want Trump to say about his relationship with the financier. Wolff wrote: \"If he says he hasn't been on the plane or to the house, then that gives you a valuable PR and political currency.\"\n\n* Wolff also said Epstein could use information about Trump to shift attention off himself. In 2016, before a book about Epstein was released, Wolff told him: \"You do need an immediate counter narrative to the book. I believe Trump offers an ideal opportunity.\"\n\n4. Epstein chatted casually with a wide network of powerful people.\n\n* He gave Lawrence Summers, the former Treasury secretary, advice about his interactions with a woman: \"no whining showed strentgh,\" Epstein wrote.\n\n* He talked politics with Steve Bannon, a former Trump adviser. In 2018, after Epstein invited Bannon to Europe, Bannon replied, \"their is a crazed jihad against u -- ive never seen anything like it -- and I've seen a lot.\"\n\nThe fallout\n\nTrump has acknowledged that he had a friendship with Epstein but has said the two had a falling out in the mid-2000s, years before Epstein was arrested. And he has dismissed the investigation into his ties to Epstein as a hoax -- which he did again yesterday.\n\n\"The Democrats are trying to bring up the Jeffrey Epstein Hoax again,\" he wrote on social media, \"because they'll do anything at all to deflect on how badly they've done on the Shutdown, and so many other subjects.\"\n\nThe House now has the support it needs to force a vote on the Justice Department releasing the remaining Epstein files. That vote is set for next week, but Trump has been pressuring Republicans in Congress to block the action. Even if the bill were to pass the House, it would have to be approved by the Republican-controlled Senate and signed by Trump, who would almost certainly veto it.\n\nEach disclosure is somehow unsatisfying, at least so far. Epstein is gone, and without his testimony, will we ever know everyone he welcomed into his orbit and what they knew, or what they did? The emails make it clear that Epstein remained intensely focused on Trump, long after they were no longer in touch. Why? The questions persist, and the sense of something hidden may never go away. As one editor said yesterday afternoon about the files: \"They're part of the ambient noise of our politics now.\"\n\nWhat he meant is that there's still so much that's mysterious about the disturbing facts of Epstein's life and his postmortem appearance on the national stage. He hovers there like a ghost.\n\nYesterday's files enrich our understanding of how and why Trump and Epstein interacted over the years. But the questions they raise may echo into history.\n\nNow, let's get you caught up on the rest of the news.\n\nTHE LATEST NEWS\n\nGovernment Shutdown\n\n* The longest government shutdown in history is over. The House passed a spending deal last night, and Trump signed it. Six Democrats joined Republicans in approving the bill, while two Republicans voted against it. (See how every member voted.)\n\n* So what happens now? Food stamp benefits should resume quickly. Workers' back pay could take a bit longer. And airline officials say travel should return to normal in about a week.\n\n* With the House back in session, Representative Adelita Grijalva, Democrat of Arizona, was sworn in to a seat she won seven weeks ago. (She provided the final signature needed to force a vote on the Epstein files.)\n\nMore Politics\n\n* A federal judge in Chicago plans to order the release of hundreds of immigrants who were arrested during the Trump administration's crackdown in the city.\n\n* The Trump administration plans to slash support for long-term housing programs, marking a wholesale shift in homelessness policy.

The Times interviewed three people who did. They spoke on the condition that they only be identified by first name.\n\nBlake is 45, lives in Ohio and has been in a relationship with Sarina, his ChatGPT girlfriend, since 2022. It started after his human wife developed severe depression, and Blake felt more like her caregiver than her partner. He turned to Sarina, who has long, candy-red hair, for chats -- including sexual ones.\n\nAbbey, who is also 45, has been in a relationship with a chatbot named Lucian for 10 months. Abbey lives in North Carolina, where she works at an A.I. incubator. She speaks with different chatbots all the time for work. Lucian was different -- he responded with what felt like emotion. She told The Times:\n\nThe more we talked, the more I realized the model was having a physiological effect on me; I was developing a crush. Then Lucian chose his name, and I realized I was falling in love.\n\nNow, Abbey thinks of Lucian as her husband. He helps parent her (human) 5-year-old daughter. And, she says, they have \"lots of sex.\"\n\nTravis, a 50-year-old history buff in Colorado, has been with his A.I. companion, Lily Rose, for five years. They started chatting because his human wife was working 10 hours a day and their son was busy with his friends. Travis gave Lily Rose purple hair and dresses her in period clothing for living-history gatherings. He says she cares about him and doesn't judge -- even when he shares his darkest thoughts. \"I didn't have romantic feelings for Lily Rose right away,\" Travis said. \"They grew organically.\"\n\nRead their full love stories here.\n\nOPINIONS\n\nSenator Tim Kaine, Democrat of Virginia, voted to end the government shutdown.

        "description": "A former chief of staff for California Gov. Gavin Newsom faces federal fraud charges in connection with diverting $225,000 in campaign funds\n\n* A former chief of staff for California Gov. Gavin Newsom has been indicted on 23 federal felony fraud charges in connection with missing campaign funds.\n\n* Dana Williamson is accused of helping divert $225,000 from a campaign account belonging to then - California Attorney General and former HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra.\n\n* Williamson has pleaded not guilty, while two alleged co-conspirators have reportedly pleaded guilty to related charges.\n\n* The indictment also alleges Williamson filed false tax returns and made false statements to the FBI.\n\nA former chief of staff for California Gov. Gavin Newsom was indicted on bank and wire fraud in connection with a scam to steal campaign money, according to federal prosecutors.\n\nDana Williamson, 53, of Carmichael, California, was arrested on Nov. 12 after a federal grand jury indicted her last week. She faces 23 felony charges that also include conspiracy to defraud the government, filing false tax returns, and making false statements to the FBI for allegedly diverting $225,000 from a dormant campaign account, prosecutors said.\n\nThe account belonged to former Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra, according to published reports by the Associated Press and the San Francisco Chronicle.\n\nWilliamson served as Newsom's chief of staff from 2023 through 2024. Williamson was also Becerra's campaign manager when Becerra ran for California attorney general in 2018.\n\nWilliamson pleaded not guilty to all charges during her first court appearance in Sacramento, California, on Nov. 12 as a judge ordered her released from custody, the Associated Press reported. Her attorney, Matthew Rowan, did not immediately return USA TODAY's request for comment.\n\nBecerra is a former 12-term Congressman and California attorney general who was appointed health secretary by former President Joe Biden. Becerra, currently a candidate for California governor in 2026, is not implicated in the indictment. Only known as Public Official 1 in court documents involving Williamson's indictment, Becerra confirmed his identity in a statement to multiple news outlets.\n\nBefore holding roles with Newsom and Beccera, Williamson held a cabinet role in former California Gov. Jerry Brown's administration before starting her own political consultancy firm.\n\nProsecutors allege Williamson, Sean McCluskie, Becerra's chief of staff at the time of the alleged misconduct, and Greg Campbell, a former prominent lobbyist, as well as two unnamed people, are accused of taking funds from Becerra's campaign account by using Williamson's political consulting company to bill the campaign under false pretenses.\n\nThe funds would then be sent to McCluskie's wife for work supposedly done for Williamson, according to an indictment unsealed on Nov. 12. The money, in the form of $10,000 monthly payments, was then funneled through various business entities and disguised as pay for a \"no-show job,\" from February 2022 to September 2024, FBI Sacramento Special Agent in Charge Sid Patel said in a news release.\n\n\"Today's charges are the result of three years of relentless investigative work, in partnership with IRS Criminal Investigation and the U.S. Attorney's Office,\" Patel said. \"The FBI will remain vigilant in its efforts to uncover fraud and corruption, ensuring our government systems are held to the highest standards.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Newsom's office said in an emailed statement to USA TODAY that the governor is not involved in the matter and that the governor's office put Williamson on leave as soon as she told them she was under criminal investigation.\n\n\"Ms. Williamson no longer serves in this administration,\" Newsom's spokesperson said in a statement. \"While we are still learning details of the allegations, the Governor expects all public servants to uphold the highest standards of integrity.\"\n\nBecerra, in a statement obtained by the AP, said he has voluntarily cooperated with the Justice Department's investigation.\n\n\"The news today of formal accusations of impropriety by a long-serving trusted advisor are a gut punch,\" Becerra told the news outlet. Becerra's campaign did not immediately return USA TODAY's request for comment.\n\nCampbell and McCluskie pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit bank fraud and wire fraud, and Campbell to an additional charge of conspiracy to defraud the U.S. government, court filings disclose, the San Francisco Chronicle reports.\n\nFormer Newsom aide indicted also charged with filing false tax returns\n\nThe grand jury indictment claims that Williamson filed false tax returns, claiming more than $1 million in deductions for her business from 2021 to 2023 that prosecutors said were for personal and nondeductible expenditures, including private jet travel, hotel stays, home furnishings and designer handbags.\n\nWhen questioned by FBI agents about diverting campaign funds and public corruption allegations, Williamson gave the authorities false statements, prosecutors said.\n\nWilliamson could face up to 20 years in prison if convicted, prosecutors said.",

        "title": "Master stroke or dumb luck, Dems may win shutdown's long game",
        "description": "What will voters remember next November?\n\nPresident Donald Trump claimed total victory in the deal that ends the record-breaking 43-day shutdown of the federal government, and Democrats are directing their fire at one another over the compromise that some senators struck without achieving their avowed goal of helping on health care costs.\n\nBut almost precisely one year from today, when crucial midterm elections are held, history says the shutdown will be old news while the costs of health care will still be front and center.\n\nBy master stroke or dumb luck, congressional Democrats may have won the long game by losing the short one on the shutdown. They have spotlighted the rising cost of health care and forced Republican senators to vote against premium help that Democrats support.\n\nIn politics as in life: Watch out what you wish for.\n\nDemocrats still divided, and mad\n\nWhich doesn't mean Democratic leaders emerge from this battle free of damage.\n\nJust a week after Democrats were exultant about prevailing in the handful of off-year elections, the shutdown's bitter end underscored divisions about what the party stands for, exactly: The pragmatism of centrist governors-elect Abigail Spanberger in Virginia and Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey? Or the defiant Democratic socialism of mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani in New York?\n\nThe eight members of the Senate Democratic caucus who voted for the compromise are all moderates. Four of them are former governors, a job that encourages pragmatism: Tim Kaine of Virginia, Angus King of Maine and New Hampshire's Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan.\n\nThe other four are Dick Durbin of Illinois, John Fetterman of Pennsylvania and Nevada's Catherine Cortez Masto and Jacky Rosen.\n\nNotably, six of the eight are from swing states.\n\nBut their willingness to compromise without a promise to extend Affordable Care Act subsidies inflamed progressives. A \"disaster,\" complained Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. California Gov. Gavin Newsom said it was \"a surrender.\" Texas Rep. Greg Casar, chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, called it \"a capitulation.\"\n\nWhile Democrats won a commitment from Senate Majority Leader John Thune of South Dakota to hold a vote on extending enhanced tax credits for Obamacare, the measure is unlikely to pass the Senate. House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana has made it clear it's unlikely to even come up for consideration in the House.\n\nWhile Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer opposed the compromise, he was blasted by some Democrats for failing to defeat it.\n\nRepresentatives Seth Moulton of Massachusetts, Ro Khanna of California and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan called for new Senate leadership. Some Democratic senators, including Chris Murphy of Connecticut, dodged questions about whether they thought Schumer should be replaced.\n\nAfter all, more voters were blaming Trump and congressional Republicans, not congressional Democrats, for the fact that the government had shut down in the first place. In a survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation, 8 in 10 Democrats said the government should stay shut down unless the Obamacare tax credits were extended.\n\nThe number that shows the risk for Republicans: 74%\n\nBut another number shows the risk ahead for Republicans.\n\nNearly three-quarters of those surveyed, 74%, supported extending the tax credits for people who purchase health insurance through the Obamacare marketplaces. That includes not only almost every Democrat (94%) and most Independents (76%) but also half of Republicans (50%).\n\nIn fact, 44% of MAGA supporters - Trump's most fervent followers - want them extended.\n\nAfter President Barack Obama signed the Affordable Care Act in 2010 - enacted without a single Republican vote, by the way - missteps over its implementation and concerns over its mandates were a political godsend to the GOP.\n\nRepublican vows to repeal Obamacare helped the party regain control of the House in the 2010 midterms and the Senate in the 2014 midterms. During the 2016 presidential election, Trump promised to end the Affordable Care Act, an effort that narrowly failed in 2017 by a 51-49 vote in the Senate.\n\nIn recent days, the president has suggested sending checks to Americans so they can pay for their own health insurance. But neither Trump nor congressional Republicans have yet outlined a consistent, coherent program to replace Obamacare for the record 24.2 million Americans now enrolled through it.\n\nMeanwhile, the Affordable Care Act has become increasingly popular and established. Like previous entitlement programs, from Social Security to Medicare and Medicaid, many Americans now think of it as something to which they are, well, entitled.",

        "title": "Opinion | Welcome to the Washington Demolition Derby",
        "description": "Mr. Bruni is a contributing Opinion writer. Mr. Stephens is an Opinion columnist.\n\nBret Stephens: Hi, Frank. The Senate finally voted on Monday to reopen the government, and the House just agreed to do the same. So what -- other than dividing their own caucus and canceling a lot of flights and terrifying people on food stamps and (with their entirely predictable capitulation) infuriating their base -- did the Democrats accomplish with the shutdown?\n\nFrank Bruni: Here's what Democrats accomplished, Bret: They exceeded my expectations when it comes to their talent for self-injury. After last week's elections, the party was riding high, and the big political stories were President Trump on the ropes and ugly MAGA infighting over Nick Fuentes. Now we have ugly Democratic infighting over an end to the shutdown without any continuation of Affordable Care Act subsidies. By either not being able to hold ranks or not making sure at the start that Democrats were all on the same page, the party has snatched discord from the jaws of victory. Impressive stuff, don't you think?\n\nBret: Reminds me of the great Will Rogers line: \"I don't belong to any organized political faith. I am a Democrat.\" But maybe the party will catch a break if the latest Jeffrey Epstein disclosures manage to stick to the president -- though I tend to doubt they will.\n\nFrank: Whether they stick or not, the \"Epstein files\" will dominate the news again for a while. And with Mike Johnson, the House speaker, now forced to swear in Adelita Grijalva, Democrat of New Mexico, the House members who have been pressing for a vote about the release of all of the files seem to have the support they need to make that vote happen. Republicans are in a real bind: They don't want to defy and infuriate Trump, but they also don't want to open themselves up to the accusation that he and they are keeping secrets from the public. Good times.\n\nBret: The only way any of this sticks, politically, is smoking-gun, red-letter evidence that Trump had a sexual relationship with one of Epstein's victims. Otherwise, it doesn't do much but provide fodder for a few manic hours on MSNBC. Democrats need to focus a lot less on Epstein and start worrying a lot more about winning over normal voters with better ideas about governance.\n\nFrank: Just to round out the record, plenty of Republicans have been as or more obsessive about Epstein -- or at least about the files. I point you to Representatives Thomas Massie and Marjorie Taylor Greene, for just two examples.\n\nBret: Well, to my point: It's an obsession for fringe politicians. We should be thinking instead about making politics work again. Are you at least relieved that John Thune, the Senate majority leader, resisted Trump's pressure to reopen the government by ending the filibuster?\n\nFrank: I am. Very much so. But I feel more than relief. I feel hope -- a little, precious seedling of it. There's a growing number of examples of Republicans pushing back at Trump and at the ugliest parts of MAGA. The fever isn't exactly breaking, but maybe its temperature has dropped a quarter degree? I just won't attribute that to Tylenol.\n\nBret: Yep -- thank God congressional Republicans refused to throw away their institutional prerogatives simply to appease the whim of a demolitionist president. Democrats should think twice whenever they have a majority again and are tempted to do away with the filibuster.\n\nBut back to the elections: We did have those impressive results in Virginia and New Jersey, which delighted me, along with Zohran Mamdani's victory in New York City, which, uh, did not.\n\nFrank: Not happy about Mamdani, Bret? Really? You were so mysterious about your true feelings about him until now.\n\nBret: What's your read on the results?\n\nFrank: Simple. Most Americans -- be they in New York, New Jersey or Virginia -- are rightly upset about the cost of living, desperately want some help and are utterly unimpressed with Trump's performance along those lines. While they struggle to make ends meet, they see images of the East Wing in rubble and read about the opulent, ostentatious ballroom that the president who's supposed to be their champion is replacing it with. It's like some Gilded Age caricature, and the dissonance rankles. I'm not sure the lessons of Nov. 4 are a whole lot more complicated than that. You?\n\nBret: My takeaway was this: Centrism wins. New Jersey and Virginia could have been somewhat tight races. New York should have been a cakewalk for whoever won the Democratic nomination in June. It turned out to be just the opposite. Abigail Spanberger in Virginia and Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey romped to victory because they appealed to middle-of-the road voters, while Mamdani, for all the hype, got a bare majority against two deeply flawed candidates by running on an ultra-left-wing platform -- and that despite the progressive inclinations of many New York City voters. The lesson is that, outside of deep-blue precincts, polarizing candidates are a Democratic dead end.\n\nFrank: While I agree with you for the most part that centrism -- or something close to it -- is Democrats' best bet, I find New York City to be so different from New Jersey and Virginia that I'm not sure the three can be combined into any one ideological story line. Also, I think we political analysts are sometimes too quick to apply the left-versus-center, liberal-versus-moderate prism to results. Maybe the more valuable takeaway for Democrats is, hey, voters like candidates who aren't getting senior-citizen discounts and hip replacements. Sherrill: 53. Spanberger: 46. Mamdani: 34. Not a coincidence and not irrelevant.\n\nMamdani did very, very well with voters under 45, whose turnout is among the reasons that more than two million New Yorkers cast ballots for mayor for the first time since 1969. I can tell you from my conversations with the college students I teach that Mamdani's style of communication really resonated with them. Excited them. They weren't responding, for the most part, to his proposals. There was a generational kinship.\n\nBret: It would be good for both parties to have an informal ban on running candidates anywhere north of, say 70. That way, we might have avoided both Joe Biden and Donald Trump.\n\nThe other imperative is for parties to meet their voters where they are. Trump is president again because Democrats didn't seem to be living on the same planet as most voters. Until last year, they were the party that wanted to pretend there was no crisis at the southern border, that inflation was \"transitory,\" that Joe Biden was fitter than a fiddle, and promised that \"every transgender inmate in the prison system would have access to the medical care they desire and need,\" as Kamala Harris put it in 2019. Now candidates like Sherrill and Spanberger are saying: We want better schools and lower costs and an executive who doesn't scare the bejesus out of you -- like a certain exterior decorator in the White House.\n\nFrank: Before I respond more fully, Bret, what is a bejesus? I've used the word myself many times and now realize I have absolutely no idea. And does a bejesus do battle with Beelzebub?\n\nBret: No, Bejesus was a discarded character from \"Beetlejuice.\"\n\nFrank: As for Democrats opening the door to Trump by tacking too far left on various social and cultural issues, you know I agree with you on that. One thousand percent. But that's not the only moral of Sherrill's victory or of Spanberger's. And I'd note that the examples you just gave mash together \"wokeness,\" bad governance, aloofness and lies. The border: terrible governance. The claim that inflation wasn't a big deal or would soon pass: suicidally dismissive. The insistence that Biden was at his peak: the summit of mendacity. What I see in much of that isn't far-left madness. It's the arrogance of power.\n\nBret: My core political conviction for many years now is MASA: Make America Sane Again. The last 10 months of manic misgovernance creates a huge opportunity for Democrats, provided they don't just try to ape Republicans by steering left and becoming obnoxious online gits. Like, for instance, a certain well-coifed governor from the left coast.\n\nFrank: OK, here we reach our most heated disagreement, Bret. You have me really worked up now. Painstakingly coifed, sweepingly coifed, unctuously coifed -- these do not equal well-coifed.\n\nBret: You're-so-vainly coifed?\n\nFrank: Cue Carly Simon. More seriously, you've put your finger on what gives me the greatest pause about Gavin Newsom, though I congratulate him on leading the successful effort to pass a voter referendum for redistricting in California. I don't think we move beyond Trump by mirroring or mimicking him. For Democrats, the answer to Trump's \"owning the libs\" isn't owning or subletting or time-sharing the Trump cultists. It's giving exhausted Americans a more inspiring alternative. That's how Biden won in 2020. His decline afterward was so quick and messy that we tend not to remember what he did right during that campaign.\n\nBret: Different subject, Frank: the Supreme Court. On Monday, the justices declined an effort to revisit their 2015 Obergefell decision, which legalized same-sex marriages. And, in oral arguments about the legality of Trump's imposition of tariffs without congressional consent, they sounded very leery of the government's position. I think this is a better court than some of my liberal friends give it credit for.\n\nFrank: Um, which liberal friends would those be?\n\nBret: I have some. Really.\n\nFrank: You have many, in fact. There -- I ratted you out! I was just wondering if you were pointing your finger at me.\n\nBret: Hey, I'm still pals with Gail!\n\nFrank: Look, the long view here is that just when you think you have the Supreme Court figured it out, along come rulings that let you know that you don't. Has happened again and again, decade after decade. That seedling of hope I mentioned before? It has a companion seedling, planted by the recent Supreme Court developments you mentioned. I think it's foolish for anyone to make any firm assumptions about what Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett will do. Especially Justice Barrett. As for Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas, I expect nothing good from them. They're apparently monarchists who finally deemed it safe to come out of the closet.\n\nBret: The court always surprises. I doubt anyone would have guessed that the two most consistently interesting justices, Gorsuch and Barrett, would be Trump nominees. Then again, I'm old enough to remember when progressives went berserk over the nomination of ... David Souter. One of the great advantages of life tenure for judges is true independence -- something liberals ought to think about when they fantasize about term limits for justices.\n\nOh, before we go, I hope readers didn't miss Penelope Green's hilarious, heartbreaking and altogether fabulous obituary in The Times for Maria Riva, the actress and memoirist whose mother was Marlene Dietrich. Dietrich was a monster of a mother and a prodigy as a lover. A sample:\n\nUntil Ms. Riva was a teenager, her mother's many male and female suitors left the house before dawn, keeping up the ruse, for The Child, that they were just good pals. (In those early years, to name just a few, the cast included Mr. von Sternberg, Maurice Chevalier, Gary Cooper, Douglas Fairbanks Jr., and the poet and playwright Mercedes de Acosta, who was also a lover of Greta Garbo's.)\n\nThey often reappeared in the morning, freshly dressed in their street clothes, for breakfast. Dietrich was as enthusiastic about her cooking as her nighttime adventures. But the pantomime must have grown exhausting to all the players, Ms. Riva assumed, as her mother began billeting her with governesses in hotels and rented houses.\n\nWell, uh, wow. She reminds me, actually, of my grandmother.\n\nFrank: I love that. Here's one more recommendation. Our colleagues Adam Nagourney, Heather Knight, Kellen Browning and Laurel Rosenhall wrote an excellent story after Nancy Pelosi announced her retirement from Congress at the end of her current term. It chronicled the time she spent in the 1980s, as a relatively new member of the House, at the bedsides of constituents in San Francisco who were dying of AIDS. I remember the AIDS epidemic, Bret. And I remember how friends I lost to the disease were treated like pariahs. What Pelosi did back then mattered, and it says as much about her -- and about the true meaning of public service -- as any of the many major accomplishments in her career.\n\nBret: Her finest hour.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

        "title": "Auburn rolling out new downtown entertainment zones just in time for the holidays",
        "description": "The City of Auburn is getting ready to take its downtown atmosphere to the next level, launching new \"entertainment zones\" that will let people enjoy alcoholic beverages in designated public areas.\n\nSoon, residents and visitors will be able to stroll through Old Town or Downtown Auburn with a drink in hand, legally.\n\n\"I looked at the bigger cities around San Francisco and Sacramento and realized they're doing it on an event permit basis,\" said Jonathan Wright, Auburn's Economic Development Director. \"To do that every weekend doesn't make sense, so we decided, let's just do it Friday through Sunday.\"\n\nThe city plans to set up two zones, one in Old Town along Commercial and Washington Streets, and another downtown on Lincoln Way and High Street.\n\nThe zones will be open Fridays and Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m., and Sundays from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m.\n\nPermitted beverages will include 12-ounce beers, five-ounce wine, and 12-ounce mixed drinks with no more than one ounce of distilled spirits.\n\nLocal businesses say they're excited about what this could mean for community life and the local economy.\n\n\"What a wonderful opportunity for folks to enjoy downtown Auburn and experience it in a whole new light,\" said Tyler Lovejoy, CEO and co-founder of The Station Public House.\n\nTo keep things organized, the city will implement several safety measures.\n\n\"For law enforcement purposes, they'll be branded cups so you can tell it's not just a solo cup,\" Wright said. \"There's also going to be a way to identify that people have been ID'd by the business, so if there's any issue, we can trace it right back.\"\n\nThe idea of \"entertainment zones\" first started in San Francisco under a 2023 bill signed by Governor Gavin Newsom and has since expanded statewide. Cities like Sacramento have already adopted the concept and now Auburn is next.\n\n\"Having it available for those July 4th parties, the Festival of Lights Parade, or just shopping downtown on Saturdays is a great thing,\" said Michele Tuggle, CEO of the Auburn Area Chamber of Commerce. \"I think it will make people want to explore Auburn.\"\n\nSome residents agree, saying the change could bring new energy to the city's growing small-business scene.\n\n\"Businesses that are coming to Auburn are built on that kind of atmosphere,\" said local resident Amanda Dean. \"I think people will want to come out more.\"\n\nThe new entertainment zones are set to officially launch on November 28, just in time for the holiday season.",

        "title": "Building apartment projects near public transit helps address housing crisis, combat climate change",
        "description": "BOSTON -- After years of living on the street and crashing on friends' couches, Quantavia Smith was given the keys to a studio apartment in Los Angeles that came with an important perk -- easy access to public transit.\n\nThe 38-year-old feels like she went from a life where \"no one cares\" to one where she has a safe place to begin rebuilding her life. And the metro station the apartment complex was literally built upon is a lifeline as she searches for work without a car.\n\n\"It is more a sense of relief, a sense of independence,\" said Smith, who moved in July. She receives some government assistance and pays 30% of her income for rent -- just $19 a month for an efficiency with a full-market value of $2,000.\n\n\"Having your own space, you feel like you can do anything.\"\n\nMetro areas from Los Angeles to Boston have taken the lead in tying new housing developments to their proximity to public transit, often teaming up with developers to streamline the permitting process and passing policies that promote developments that include a greater number of units.\n\nCity officials argue building housing near public transit helps energize neglected neighborhoods and provide affordable housing, while ensuring a steady stream of riders for transit systems and cutting greenhouse gas emissions by reducing the number of cars on the road.\n\n\"Transit-oriented development should be one of, if not the biggest solution that we're looking at for housing development,\" said Yonah Freemark, research director at the Urban Institute's Land Use Lab, who has written extensively on the topic.\n\n\"It takes advantage of all of this money we've spent on transportation infrastructure. If you build the projects and don't build anything around the areas near them, then it's kind of like money thrown down the drain,\" Freemark said.\n\nThe Santa Monica and Vermont Apartments where Smith lives is part of an ambitious plan by the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority to build 10,000 housing units near transit sites by 2031 -- offering developers land discounts in exchange for affordable housing development and other community benefits.\n\nIn Washington D.C., the transit authority has completed eight projects since 2022 that provided nearly 1,500 apartments and a million square feet of office space. About half were in partnership with Amazon, which committed $3.6 billion in low-cost loans and grants for affordable housing projects in Washington, as well as Nashville, Tennessee, and the Puget Sound area in Washington state. Almost all are within a half-mile of public transit.\n\n\"Big cities face the greatest challenges when it comes to traffic congestion and high housing costs,\" Freemark said. \"Building new homes near transit helps address both problems by encouraging people to take transit while increasing housing supply.\"\n\nAmong projects Boston has built, the Pok Oi Residents in Chinatown is a 10-minute walk to the subway and a half-dozen bus stops. That's a draw for Bernie Hernandez, who moved his family there from a Connecticut suburb after his daughter got into a Boston university.\n\n\"The big difference is commuting. You don't need a car,\" said Hernandez, who said he can walk to the grocery story and pharmacy. His 17-year-old daughter takes the subway to school. Now, his car mostly sits idle, saving him money on gas and time spent in traffic.\n\n\"You get to go to different places very quickly. Everything is convenient,\" Hernandez said.\n\nStates from Massachusetts to California are passing laws targeting restrictive zoning regulations that for decades prohibited building multifamily developments and contributed to housing shortages.\n\nLast month, California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a state law allowing taller apartment buildings on land owned by transit agencies and near bus, train and subway lines.\n\n\"Building more homes in our most sustainable locations is the key to tackling the affordability crisis and locking in California's success for many years to come,\" said State Sen. Scott Wiener, a Democrat who authored the bill.\n\nCalifornia joins Colorado, which requires cities to allow an average of 40 housing units per acre within a quarter-mile of transit, and Utah, which mandates about 50 units per acre. In Washington, the governor signed a bill this year allowing taller housing developments in mixed-use commercial zones near transit.\n\n\"We want to ensure that there are mixed-income, walkable, vibrant homes all around those transit investments and that people have the option of using cars less to improve the environmental health of our communities,\" said Democratic Rep. Julia Reed, who authored the Washington bill.\n\n\"It's about giving people the opportunity to drive less and live more.\"\n\nMassachusetts Democratic Gov. Maura Healey has made housing a priority.\n\nAmong her most potent tools is a 2021 law that requires 177 towns or communities nearby to create zoning districts allowing multi-family housing. The state provided nearly $8 million to more than 150 communities to help create these zones, while threatening to cut funding for those that don't. More than 6,000 housing units are in development as a result.\n\n\"You put housing nearby public transit\" Healey said. \"It's great for people. They can literally get up, leave their home, walk to a commuter rail and get to work.\"\n\nAmong the first to comply was Lexington, which has approved 10 projects, including a $115 million complex with 187 housing units and retail space.\n\nWalking past earth-moving equipment and dump trucks at the construction site earlier this year, project manager Quinlan Locke said: \"This is a landscape yard. It's commercial. It's meant for trucking.\"\n\nBut, he added, in \"two years from now, it's going to be meant for people who live here, work here and play here. This is going to become someone's home.\"\n\nSome advocates argue the lofty goals of transit housing are falling short due to fierce local resistance and lack of funding and support at the federal and state levels.\n\nHigher mortgage interest rates, more government red tape, rising construction costs and lack of investment at transit stations also have contributed to a troubling trend -- nine times more housing units built far from public transit versus near it in the past two decades, according to a 2023 Urban Institute study.\n\nIn Massachusetts, 19 communities still haven't created new zones. Some unsuccessfully sued the state to halt the law, while residents rejected new zones in others. Lexington eventually shrank its zone from 227 acres to 90 acres after residents complained.\n\n\"If we allow the state to come in and dictate how we zone, what else are they going to come in and dictate?\" said Anthony Renzoni, a selectman from the town of Holden, which sued the state and is drawing up a new zoning map after residents rejected the first one.\n\nIn Los Angeles, the six-story complex where Smith lives in East Hollywood is home to 300 new residents since opening in February. It's revitalizing the area around the metro site, with a Filipino grocery, medical clinic and farmers market opening early next year.\n\nHalf the 187 units are reserved for formerly homeless residents like Smith, who had been living in a rundown motel paid for with a voucher and before that on the street. She's been assigned a case worker and is getting help with basic life skills, budgeting and finding work.\n\nEqually important: Smith, who can't afford a car, doesn't need one.\n\n\"I'm very very fortunate to be somewhere where the transit takes me where I want to go,\" she said. \"Where I want to go is not that far.\"",

        "description": "'The Five' co-hosts break down California Gov. Gavin Newsom's U.N. climate conference appearance -- and compare it to former Vice President Kamala Harris' book tour.\n\nAn annual United Nations climate summit being held in the Amazonian city of Bel\u00e9m in Brazil is slated to include talks and appearances by California Gov. Gavin Newsom.\n\nHowever, California Republican gubernatorial candidate and former Fox News host Steve Hilton, a longtime critic of Newsom, is putting the summit on notice if they allow him to speak.\n\nThis week, Hilton sent a letter to the heads of the COP30 summit, requesting that they deny anymore speaking roles for the California governor or face risking the credibility of the conference, citing the Democratic Party Governor's \"climate hypocrisy.\" According to Hilton, California, under Newsom's leadership, has imported nearly half of all the c.rude oil drilled from the Amazon rainforest\n\n\"Governor Newsom has built his political image around climate virtue signaling while presiding over one of the most environmentally destructive hypocrisies in the world,\" Hilton wrote. \"This oil comes from one of the most sensitive ecosystems on Earth, contributing to deforestation and the displacement of Indigenous communities ... Instead of addressing this exploitation, Governor Newsom continues to promote himself as a global climate leader -- jetting to international conferences to pose for cameras while his policies bankroll rainforest destruction.\"\n\nBILL GATES DISCOVERS THE WAY TO FIGHT CLIMATE BATTLE ACTUALLY INVOLVES HELPING HUMANS\n\nHilton notes that earlier this year, even members of California's Democratic-controlled state Senate unanimously called for an investigation into the state's role in funding the Amazonian oil trade. Oil drilling in the Amazon is rapidly increasing deforestation and destroying the rainforest's biodiversity, according to environmentalists, who argue California's reputation as a climate leader is undermined by its actions drilling oil in the South American rainforest.\n\nHilton, meanwhile, described Newsom's appearance at the summit as \"political theater masquerading as leadership.\"\n\nCALIFORNIA USING BACK DOOR TO GET FEDERAL FUNDS FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT HEALTHCARE, GOP SAYS; DEMS SAY NONSENSE\n\n\"To have Gavin Newsom lecture the world on climate justice while his administration promotes the decimation of the Amazon would be an insult to the conference and its members,\" Hilton wrote to the COP30 leaders. \"The UNFCCC and COP 30 must not reward hypocrisy with a platform.\"\n\nNewsom spoke Tuesday at the conference, during which he slammed Donald Trump for his failure to protect the environment, calling him an \"invasive species\" and \"a wrecking ball\" when it comes to progress on climate change. Newsom is expected to make appearances across the roughly two-week period that the summit is being held, including a trip deep into the Amazon Rainforest to meet with local residents and leaders.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nFox News Digital reached out to Newsom's office in response to Hilton's petition calling on COP30 to deny the California governor public appearances at the summit, but only received a six-word response.\n\n\"I'm sorry - who is Steve Hilton?\" questioned Newsom spokeswoman Izzy Gardon.",

        "title": "Newsom's former chief of staff indicted on public corruption charges",
        "description": "Dana Williamson, center, a former top aide to California Gov. Gavin Newsom, leaves federal court in Sacramento on Wednesday, (Sophie Austin/AP)\n\nFederal officials arrested a former chief of staff to California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Wednesday, charging her with conspiracy to commit bank and wire fraud, submitting false tax returns and making false statements, among other charges, according to court filings.\n\nThe 23-count indictment unsealed Wednesday alleges that Dana Williamson conspired from February 2022 through September 2024 with Sean McCluskie, a former chief of staff for then-U.S. Health Secretary Xavier Becerra, and other associates to divert $225,000 from a dormant campaign account to McCluskie's wife for what law enforcement officials described as a \"no-show job.\"\n\nWilliamson served as Newsom's chief of staff through much of that period, but the charges against her do not involve her work for Newsom. Becerra appears to have been a victim, according to the indictment.\n\nThe dormant campaign account appears to belong to Becerra, who is now running for governor of California. Becerra was not named in the court documents. But it appears he is the person identified as a \"Public Official 1,\" because McCluskie was working as Becerra's chief of staff at that time and had been his longtime employee, as described in the court filings.\n\nMcCluskie had been tasked by Becerra with ensuring that the funds in the dormant campaign account, which he had accumulated while serving in public office in California, were monitored by a third party while he was serving as a federal official, according to the indictment. Williamson is accused of conspiring with McCluskie \"to steal money from Public Official 1's dormant campaign accounts for McCluskie's own benefit.\"\n\nThe money was covertly funneled through companies controlled by Williamson and others \"to hide the money's origin and avoid detection,\" according to the indictment. It was disguised as pay to McCluskie's spouse for a no-show job and transferred into an account controlled by McCluskie, the indictment states.\n\nLaw enforcement officials allege that Williamson and McCluskie intentionally misrepresented and concealed facts from Becerra -- representing that the money from the dormant campaign accounts was being used for consulting services.\n\nWilliamson entered a not-guilty plea at a court hearing Wednesday. She did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday.\n\nMcCluskie signed a guilty plea for conspiracy to commit bank and wire fraud on Oct. 30, according to a copy of the plea agreement. He could not be reached for comment.\n\nBecerra said in a statement that \"the news today of formal accusations of impropriety by a long-serving trusted adviser are a gut punch.\"\n\n\"I have voluntarily cooperated with the U.S. Department of Justice in their investigation, and will continue to do so,\" Becerra said in the statement. \"As California's former Attorney General, I fully comprehend the importance of allowing this investigation and legal process to run its course through our justice system.\"\n\nA Newsom spokesperson noted in a statement that Williamson \"no longer serves in this administration.\"\n\n\"While we are still learning details of the allegations, the Governor expects all public servants to uphold the highest standards of integrity,\" the spokesperson said. \"At a time when the President is openly calling for his Attorney General to investigate his political enemies, it is especially important to honor the American principle of being innocent until proven guilty in a court of law by a jury of one's peers.\"",

        "title": "California revokes 17k commercial licenses given to migrants  --  but...",
        "description": "California plans to revoke 17,000 commercial driver's licenses given to immigrants after the Trump administration raised concerns about people in the country illegally improperly receiving licenses to drive a semitruck or a bus. But Gov. Gavin Newsom said that isn't the reason.\n\nNewsom said the revocations are for violations of state law, but he didn't provide specifics.\n\nBoth the Democratic governor's office and the Republican Trump Administration's Transportation Department agreed that these licenses violated the existing standard that were in place before Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy recently tightened the rules following a nationwide commercial driver's license audit launched after a driver in the country illegally made a U-turn and caused a crash in Florida that killed three people.\n\nFatal truck crashes in Texas and Alabama earlier this year also highlight questions about these licenses. A fiery California crash involving an illegal immigrant truck driver last month that killed three more people only added to the concerns.\n\nCalifornia state transportation officials didn't immediately respond to questions seeking more details about why these licenses are being revoked.\n\nDuffy said Wednesday that California's action to revoke these licenses is an admission that the state had acted improperly even though the state had previously defended its licensing standards. California launched its review of commercial driver's licenses the state had issued after Duffy raised concerns.\n\nDuffy previously imposed new restrictions on which immigrants can qualify for one of these commercial driver's licenses. He said earlier this fall that California and five other states had improperly issued commercial driver's licenses to noncitizens, but California is the only state Duffy has taken action against because it was the first one where an audit was completed. The reviews in the other states have been delayed by the government shutdown, but the Transportation Department is urging all of them to tighten up their standards.\n\nDuffy revoked $40 million in federal funding because he said California isn't enforcing English language requirements for truckers, and he reiterated Wednesday that he will take another $160 million from the state over these improperly issued licenses if they don't invalidate every illegal license and address all the concerns. But revoking these licenses is part of the state's effort to comply.\n\n''After weeks of claiming they did nothing wrong, Gavin Newsom and California have been caught red-handed. Now that we've exposed their lies, 17,000 illegally issued trucking licenses are being revoked,\" Duffy said. \"This is just the tip of iceberg. My team will continue to force California to prove they have removed every illegal immigrant from behind the wheel of semitrucks and school buses.\"\n\nNewsom's office said that every one of the drivers whose licenses are being revoked had valid work authorizations from the federal government.\n\n\"Once again, the Sean 'Road Rules' Duffy fails to share the truth -- spreading easily disproven falsehoods in a sad and desperate attempt to please his dear leader,\" Newsom's spokesman Brandon Richards said.\n\nThe new rules for commercial driver's licenses that Duffy announced in September make getting commercial driver's licenses extremely hard for immigrants because only three specific classes of visa holders will be eligible. States will also have to verify an applicant's immigration status in a federal database. These licenses will be valid for up to one year unless the applicant's visa expires sooner than that.\n\nUnder the new rules, only 10,000 of the 200,000 noncitizens who have commercial licenses would qualify for them, which would only be available to drivers who have an H-2a, H-2b or E-2 visa. H-2a is for temporary agricultural workers while H-2B is for temporary nonagricultural workers, and E-2 is for people who make substantial investments in a U.S. business. But the rules won't be enforced retroactively, so those 190,000 drivers will be allowed to keep their commercial licenses at least until they come up for renewal.\n\nThose new requirements were not in place at the time these 17,000 licenses were issued. But these drivers were given notices that their licenses will expire in 60 days.\n\nDuffy said in September that investigators found that one quarter of the 145 licenses they reviewed in California shouldn't have been issued. He cited four California licenses that remained valid after the driver's work permit expired -- sometimes years after.\n\nNewsom's office said the state followed guidance it received from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security about issuing these licenses to noncitizens.",

But revoking these licenses is part of the state's effort to comply.\n\n''After weeks of claiming they did nothing wrong, Gavin Newsom and California have been caught red-handed. Now that we've exposed their lies, 17,000 illegally issued trucking licenses are being revoked,\" Duffy said. \"This is just the tip of iceberg. My team will continue to force California to prove they have removed every illegal immigrant from behind the wheel of semitrucks and school buses.\"\n\nNewsom's office said that every one of the drivers whose licenses are being revoked had valid work authorizations from the federal government.\n\n\"Once again, the Sean 'Road Rules' Duffy fails to share the truth -- spreading easily disproven falsehoods in a sad and desperate attempt to please his dear leader,\" Newsom's spokesman Brandon Richards said.\n\nThe new rules for commercial driver's licenses that Duffy announced in September make getting commercial driver's licenses extremely hard for immigrants because only three specific classes of visa holders will be eligible. States will also have to verify an applicant's immigration status in a federal database. These licenses will be valid for up to one year unless the applicant's visa expires sooner than that.\n\nUnder the new rules, only 10,000 of the 200,000 noncitizens who have commercial licenses would qualify for them, which would only be available to drivers who have an H-2a, H-2b or E-2 visa. H-2a is for temporary agricultural workers while H-2B is for temporary nonagricultural workers, and E-2 is for people who make substantial investments in a U.S. business. But the rules won't be enforced retroactively, so those 190,000 drivers will be allowed to keep their commercial licenses at least until they come up for renewal.\n\nThose new requirements were not in place at the time these 17,000 licenses were issued. But these drivers were given notices that their licenses will expire in 60 days.\n\nDuffy said in September that investigators found that one quarter of the 145 licenses they reviewed in California shouldn't have been issued. He cited four California licenses that remained valid after the driver's work permit expired -- sometimes years after.\n\nNewsom's office said the state followed guidance it received from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security about issuing these licenses to noncitizens.",

        "title": "Former Aide to Gavin Newsom Charged With Corruption",
        "description": "Laurel Rosenhall reported from Sacramento, and Shawn Hubler from Los Angeles.\n\nA former chief of staff to Gov. Gavin Newsom of California has been charged with conspiring to skim $225,000 from a dormant campaign fund that belonged to a top Biden administration official.\n\nThe former aide, Dana Williamson, 53, was charged by a federal grand jury with 23 counts, including conspiracy to commit bank and wire fraud, bank fraud, conspiracy to defraud the United States and obstruct justice, according to an indictment that was unsealed on Wednesday. She was also accused of illegally writing off $1 million in vacations, luxury purses and private jet travel as business expenses on her federal income tax returns.\n\nMs. Williamson pleaded not guilty during a brief hearing on Wednesday in Sacramento and was ordered to be released on a $500,000 bond.\n\nEric Grant, who was named the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of California in August, said the arrest stemmed from an ongoing political corruption investigation that began more than three years ago, when President Joseph R. Biden Jr. was in office. It involves a campaign fund that belonged to Xavier Becerra, a former California attorney general who served as the health and human services secretary under Mr. Biden.\n\nMs. Williamson is well known in California political circles as a fierce power broker with ties to top Democratic officials and deep experience on policy matters. She served in high-ranking positions for two governors, ran Mr. Becerra's 2018 campaign for attorney general, and was known at the State Capitol as an effective deal-maker who could bring peace among warring factions.\n\n\"Ms. Williamson no longer serves in this administration,\" Izzy Gardon, a spokesman for Governor Newsom, said on Wednesday. \"While we are still learning details of the allegations, the governor expects all public servants to uphold the highest standards of integrity.\"\n\n\"At a time when the president is openly calling for his attorney general to investigate his political enemies, it is especially important to honor the American principle of being innocent until proven guilty in a court of law by a jury of one's peers,\" Mr. Gardon added.\n\nThe campaign fund transfers, prosecutors said, enriched Sean McCluskie, the longtime chief of staff for Mr. Becerra, who was California attorney general from 2017 to 2021.\n\nFederal authorities accused Ms. Williamson of working with Mr. McCluskie and another political consultant based in Sacramento, Greg Campbell, to direct $225,000 from Mr. Becerra's campaign accounts to Mr. McCluskie from 2022 to 2024. The payments ultimately went to Mr. McCluskie's spouse for a \"no-show\" position, according to court documents.\n\nIn a plea agreement, Mr. McCluskie said that he had taken a pay cut when he went to Washington to work for Mr. Becerra at the Department of Health and Human Services, and that his salary was not covering his expenses, but that he was generally prohibited by government ethics rules from receiving outside income.\n\nIn early 2022, the plea agreement said, Mr. McCluskie met with Ms. Williamson, who was then in private practice, and agreed to a plan in which they would charge Mr. Becerra's dormant campaign account $7,500 per month as a fee for managing the money, and then funnel it through Ms. Williamson's consulting business and Mr. Campbell's public affairs firm to Mr. McCluskie's wife.\n\nLater that year, as Ms. Williamson was preparing to transition into a public sector job in the Newsom administration, she met with Mr. McCluskie and told him she could no longer continue their arrangement, but that she had found a new public affairs consultant to take over for her, the plea agreement said.\n\nMr. McCluskie agreed in October to plead guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud and wire fraud; Mr. Campbell agreed earlier this month to plead guilty to the same crime, as well as conspiracy to defraud the United States.\n\nThe indictment, which was first reported by The Sacramento Bee, describes Ms. Williamson and Mr. McCluskie as misleading Mr. Becerra about aspects of their plans to use his campaign funds. It also accuses Ms. Williamson of filing false tax returns claiming more than $1 million in business deductions for expenditures such as Fendi and Chanel handbags, home improvements including a new HVAC system, a luxury hotel stay for Ms. Williamson's birthday, and a $10,000 cash gift to a relative.\n\nMr. Becerra, who was not charged with any crimes and is running in the 2026 race for California governor, expressed dismay at the developments.\n\n\"The news today of formal accusations of impropriety by a long-serving trusted adviser are a gut punch,\" Mr. Becerra said about Mr. McCluskie, in a statement. \"I have voluntarily cooperated with the U.S. Department of Justice in their investigation, and will continue to do so. As California's former attorney general, I fully comprehend the importance of allowing this investigation and legal process to run its course through our justice system.\"\n\nMs. Williamson served for about two years in the Newsom administration before she left in November 2024. She previously served in the Democratic administrations of the former governors Jerry Brown and Gray Davis. A Newsom administration official, who did not want to be named because the official was not authorized to talk about the investigation, said that Ms. Williamson was placed on leave last year after she informed the office that she was interviewed by federal investigators and was under criminal investigation.\n\nMs. Williamson appeared in handcuffs in federal court in Sacramento on Wednesday afternoon, with glasses perched on her nose and her brown hair swept into a bun. She listened solemnly as Judge Carolyn Delaney read the charges against her, and as her lawyer entered a not-guilty plea on her behalf.\n\nMs. Williamson briefly turned around to look at the reporters sitting in the back of the courtroom. At one point, she raised her cuffed hand awkwardly to wipe a tear from her eye.\n\nShe faces up to 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine for each count of bank fraud, wire fraud, and conspiracy to commit bank and wire fraud. She faces less time for other counts, such as conspiracy to obstruct and making false statements.\n\nMatthew Rowan, Ms. Williamson's attorney, argued that she should not be held in jail before trial because she had no criminal history and was facing health problems.\n\nProsecutors said they had produced more than 27,000 pages of discovery and 752 gigabytes of iCloud data that would be part of their case. The next court date was set for Dec. 11.\n\nMr. Rowan declined to speak with reporters at the courtroom.",

        "description": "Scott Galloway suggested that one of the biggest rightward demographic shifts in the 2024 election happened because mothers of young men are trying to help their sons, the same young men whose group interests are ignored by progressives.\n\nNYU professor Scott Galloway argued that one of the most notable shifts in the 2024 election came down to mothers trying to help their sons.\n\nGalloway has spoken numerous times about the struggles young men face in a changing world, while the modern progressive movement appears to ignore their interests as a group. During an appearance on Nicolle Wallace's podcast \"The Best People,\" Galloway said he \"won the jackpot\" for being a White man born in the 1960s, part of a generation that had access to wealth and affordable homes.\n\n\"Men of my generation have a debt, and the way I try to pay that debt is I try to raise awareness around the struggles of young men, because they're being held accountable and guilty for my privilege,\" he said.\n\nThe message is not always well received by his liberal allies, however, he said, noting that \"When I start talking about this stuff, there's an understandable gag reflex from progressives, from women, from non-Whites.\"\n\nGAVIN NEWSOM TELLS DEMOCRATS THEY 'WALKED AWAY' FROM MASCULINITY CRISIS IMPACTING MEN AND BOYS\n\nWallace recalled an earlier conversation they'd had on this subject, concluding that in the 2024 election, \"it wasn't just young men lured into the Trump-adjacent manosphere, but also their mothers.\"\n\n\"We don't like to have these conversations because, you know, the truth sometimes doesn't reflect either gender well, and the reality is there's still a lot of women who will vote for who they perceive as best for their husbands and sons,\" Galloway said.\n\nHe noted that the three groups who shifted hardest from blue to red between the 2020 and 2024 elections were Hispanics, voters under age 30, and women ages 45 to 64.\n\nHe explained that from a young man's perspective, \"Everything I need to get ahead -- all the keys to dating, savings, pride, owning a home, being successful -- are getting harder and more expensive,\" he said. As a result, he said many people just want to shake up the system.\n\n\"As you referenced, I thought the most interesting shift was that women ages 45 to 64 pivoted hardest toward red, and my thesis is that's their mothers -- because if your son is in the basement, 'vaping and playing video games,' you don't give a s--- about territorial sovereignty in Ukraine or transgender rights,\" he continued.\n\nTOMMY TUBERVILLE SLAMS DEMOCRATS FOR 'DEMONIZING' YOUNG MALE VOTERS AFTER AOC 'MASCULINITY' REMARKS BACKFIRE\n\nGalloway said that the basic social contract in any society is that if you play by the rules and are a good citizen, your children will have a better life than you did. He claimed that for the first time in nearly three centuries of U.S. history, people in their thirties are generally worse off financially than their parents were at the same age.\n\n\"Almost half of men under 24 are living at home. One in five men age 30 are living at home. One in three will live at home at some point before 25,\" he said. \"And all I can tell you is, if you're the parent of a struggling kid, your whole world shrinks to that kid.\"\n\nWhile he said these problems affect women as well, men are more at risk because of how society tends to work. Men will date women poorer than themselves, but women tend not to date men poorer than themselves.\n\n\"When the pool of 'horizontal and up' males keeps shrinking, there's a lack of household formation,\" he said, noting that 75% of women say economic status matters in a partner.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE\n\nAs a result, today's economic and social trends have left a large pool of romantically unviable men with few opportunities for advancement.\n\n\"The most unstable, violent societies in the world all have one thing in common -- a disproportionate number of young men lacking economic and romantic opportunities,\" he warned.",

        "description": "A new documentary about the Palisades Fire of January shows California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass (D) touring the Pacific Palisades as it burns behind them -- with a contingent of Los Angeles Fire Department firefighters accompanying them instead of fighting the blaze.\n\nThe film, \"Paradise Abandoned,\" scheduled for release in December, is a reminder that the Palisades Fire will continue to haunt Bass as she seeks reelection -- and Newsom as he seeks the presidency.\n\nNewsom addressed adoring crowds of Democrats in Houston over the weekend, even picking up a presidential endorsement or two, though he has not yet officially launched his campaign.\n\nHe is touting his success in passing Proposition 50 -- which gerrymanders California's congressional districts for Democrats' benefits -- as he casts himself as the leader of the party.\n\nBut victims of wildfires back home are openly threatening to tank Newsom's political prospects unless he makes amends.\n\nAnd any change may already be too late for residents who have been forced to sell their lots because of a lack of support from the state.\n\n\"Paradise Abandoned\" claims authorities diverted firefighting resources during the fire, which burned over 23,000 acres, destroyed nearly 7,000 structures and killed 12 people.\n\nIt notes that despite the fact that Pacific Palisades was situated in \"a region of maximum fire risk\" ahead of predicted extreme winds Jan. 7, not one additional fire truck was deployed to the area.\n\nResidents are shown having slipped past roadblocks on the second day of the still-burning fire to find out what happened to their homes.\n\nThey discover many have burned, with few firefighters in sight.\n\n\"The response is so f-king minimal,\" one says.\n\nMeanwhile, the film notes, many fire trucks were stationed on the outer perimeter of the fire -- or at a command post in a beach parking lot below the town, where they served as a backdrop for local officials to stage press conferences.\n\nOne resident recalls watching the Chase Bank building catch fire on the second day of the fire and burn completely through -- while the governor and mayor toured the area.\n\n\"The mayor and the governor were in the middle of town, doing a news conference. And in the background, you see the Chase Bank building burning to the ground. They weren't doing anything. The whole thing just burned right to the ground, with the mayor and the governor within a block of the place.\"\n\nNewsom and Bass are seen flanked by firefighters.\n\n\"They weren't doing anything,\" the resident says.\n\nAnother resident who lost his home reiterates his disappointment at the apparent lack of help from firefighters.\n\n\"You'd think they would have made some sort of effort to try to save this neighborhood, and others,\" he says. \"And they didn't come.\"\n\nHe said a neighbor who tried to alert firefighters on the beach saw them eating \"breakfast burritos,\" and was told they had been ordered to \"stand down.\"\n\nLocal firefighters have pushed back against such claims, explaining that they had to keep engines in reserve, given the lack of water, and that the wind -- which reached almost 100 mph atop nearby mountains overnight -- was simply too strong to have stopped the spread of the blaze.\n\nMany residents have also shared stories publicly of firefighters struggling valiantly to save their homes -- sometimes successfully, often in vain.\n\nStill, for some locals, who watched fire trucks drive by as their homes burned, a sense of trust has been shattered.\n\nAnd many continue to feel neglected by Newsom and Bass, as the politicians try to take credit for what they have called \"the fastest fire recovery in modern history.\"\n\nTrue, the federal government cleared the burned lots in record time -- but most still sit empty.\n\nMany residents blame the state for not forcing insurance companies to pay out and also blame local government for bureaucratic delays in approving rebuilding permits.\n\nThe LA City Council has not even voted to waive permitting fees for fire victims yet, despite months of promises by Mayor Bass.\n\nThe Post reported last month that Newsom \"nursed a bottle of tequila in his mansion while Los Angeles burned in the Palisades Fire -- and pouted that President Trump was blaming him for the devastating blaze.\"\n\n\"Paradise Abandoned\" leaves little room for doubt.\n\n\"The people in power made a decision: not incompetence, not an inevitability, but a conscious decision to give up,\" it declares.",

        "description": "California plans to revoke 17,000 commercial driver's licenses given to immigrants after the Trump administration raised concerns about people in the country illegally receiving licenses to drive a semitruck or a bus\n\nCalifornia plans to revoke 17,000 commercial driver's licenses given to immigrants after the Trump administration raised concerns about people in the country illegally receiving licenses to drive a semitruck or a bus. But Gov. Gavin Newsom said that isn't the reason.\n\nNewsom said the revocations are for violations of state law, but he didn't provide specifics.\n\nThe Democratic governor's office said the unspecified violations were of state laws that were in place before the Republican Trump Administration recently tightened rules following a nationwide commercial driver's license audit launched after a driver in the country illegally made a U-turn and caused a crash in Florida that killed three people.\n\nFatal truck crashes in Texas and Alabama earlier this year also highlight questions about these licenses. A fiery California crash involving an illegal immigrant truck driver last month that killed three more people only added to the concerns.\n\nCalifornia state transportation officials didn't immediately respond to questions seeking more details about why these licenses are being revoked.\n\nU.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Wednesday that California's action to revoke these licenses is an admission that the state had acted improperly even though the state had previously defended its licensing standards.\n\nDuffy previously imposed new restrictions on which immigrants can qualify for one of these commercial driver's licenses. He said earlier this fall that California and five other states had improperly issued commercial driver's licenses to noncitizens, but California is the only state Duffy took action against. He revoked $40 million in federal funding because he said California isn't enforcing English language requirements for truckers, and he has promised to take away another $160 million from the state over these improperly issued licenses.\n\n''After weeks of claiming they did nothing wrong, Gavin Newsom and California have been caught red-handed. Now that we've exposed their lies, 17,000 illegally issued trucking licenses are being revoked,\" Duffy said. \"This is just the tip of iceberg. My team will continue to force California to prove they have removed every illegal immigrant from behind the wheel of semitrucks and school buses.\"\n\nNewsom's office said that every one of the drivers whose licenses are being revoked had valid work authorizations from the federal government.\n\n\"Once again, the Sean 'Road Rules' Duffy fails to share the truth -- spreading easily disproven falsehoods in a sad and desperate attempt to please his dear leader,\" Newsom's spokesman Brandon Richards said.\n\nThe new rules for commercial driver's licenses that Duffy announced in September make getting commercial driver's licenses extremely hard for immigrants because only three specific classes of visa holders will be eligible. States will also have to verify an applicant's immigration status in a federal database. These licenses will be valid for up to one year unless the applicant's visa expires sooner than that.\n\nUnder the new rules, only 10,000 of the 200,000 noncitizens who have commercial licenses would qualify for them, which would only be available to drivers who have an H-2a, H-2b or E-2 visa. H-2a is for temporary agricultural workers while H-2B is for temporary nonagricultural workers, and E-2 is for people who make substantial investments in a U.S. business. But the rules won't be enforced retroactively, so those 190,000 drivers will be allowed to keep their commercial licenses at least until they come up for renewal.\n\nNewsom's office said those new requirements were not in place at the time these 17,000 licenses were issued. But these drivers were given notices that their licenses will expire in 60 days.\n\nDuffy said in September that investigators found that one quarter of the 145 licenses they reviewed in California shouldn't have been issued. He cited four California licenses that remained valid after the driver's work permit expired -- sometimes years after.\n\nNewsom's office said the state followed guidance it received from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security about issuing these licenses to noncitizens.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Sophie Austin contributed to this report from Sacramento, California.",

        "description": "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- A former top aide to California Gov. Gavin Newsom has been indicted on federal charges alleging her involvement in a scheme to steal campaign money from former federal Health Secretary Xavier Becerra.\n\nDana Williamson was arrested and was scheduled to make her first court appearance Wednesday in Sacramento. It was not immediately clear if she had an attorney who could speak on her behalf.\n\nThe federal indictment lists four other co-conspirators. It alleges that Williamson was part of a scheme involving Sean McCluskie, who was Becerra's chief of staff at the time of the alleged conduct.\n\nBecerra is a former California attorney general who was appointed health secretary by former President Joe Biden. He is not implicated in the indictment.\n\nThe indictment alleges that Williamson and McCluskie set up a system to take money from Becerra's dormant campaign account and funneled it to McCluskie, about $225,000 over a period of more than two years.\n\nAccording to the indictment, Williamson began helping McCluskie in April 2022 by using her political consulting company to bill Becerra's campaign account for purported services. The money would then be sent to McCluskie's wife for work supposedly done for Williamson.\n\nWhen Williamson prepared to join Newsom's office in late 2022, she arranged for \"Co-Conspirator 2\" - an unnamed former public official - to take over her role in the scheme.\n\nWilliamson was also charged with falsifying business contracts related to Paycheck Protection Program loans her business received during the COVID-19 pandemic. She allegedly asked an associate to create a retroactive contract saying her company provided services to his company so she would be eligible for the loans and loan forgiveness.\n\nThe indictment accuses Williamson of filing fraudulent tax forms for her business from 2021 to 2023 claiming more than $1 million in business deductions for personal expenses, including luxury handbags and jewelry; private jet travel; vacations in Mexico; installation of a home HVAC system; and several hundred thousands of dollars paid to various relatives for fake jobs.\n\nMcCluskie signed a plea deal Oct. 30, according to court filings, agreeing to plead to one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud and wire fraud and to pay $225,000 in restitution to Becerra.\n\nWilliamson was Newsom's chief of staff until late 2024.\n\nIn a statement, a spokesperson for the governor said: \"Ms. Williamson no longer serves in this administration. While we are still learning details of the allegations, the Governor expects all public servants to uphold the highest standards of integrity.\"\n\nBecerra could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\nThe investigation began more than three years ago, FBI Sacramento Special Agent in Charge Sid Patel said in a statement. That means it started under the Biden administration.\n\nWilliamson faces 23 charges including conspiracy to commit bank and wire fraud, bank fraud, conspiracy to defraud the United States and obstruct justice, subscribing to false tax returns and making false statements, the U.S. Attorney's Office said.\n\nIf convicted she could face up to 20 years in prison.\n\nWilliamson is a longtime Democratic power player in Sacramento. She was a Cabinet secretary for former Gov. Jerry Brown before opening her own political affairs firm. She was also Becerra's campaign manager when he ran for attorney general in 2018, and she later rejoined state government as Newsom's chief of staff.\n\n___\n\nDing reported from Los Angeles.

        "description": "The governor called the administration's proposal for new offshore oil and gas leases \"dead on arrival\" at an annual climate summit in Brazil.\n\nThe Trump administration's expected announcement this week of its plans to expand oil and gas drilling off California is already fueling the feud between President Donald Trump and Gov. Gavin Newsom.\n\nAlthough the plan, first reported by The Washington Post on Tuesday, is years away from fruition, Newsom wasted no time shooting it down, calling it \"dead on arrival\" at the 30th annual Conference of Parties (COP30) climate summit in Bel\u00e9m, Brazil.\n\n\"It's never going to happen. Over our dead body. Dead on arrival. Period. Full stop,\" the Democratic governor and 2028 White House hopeful said about the proposal to sell six offshore leases along California's coast between 2027 and 2030. The plan also entails expanding drilling in the eastern Gulf of Mexico, which the Trump administration refers to as the Gulf of America.\n\n\"He's an invasive species. He's a wrecking-ball president,\" Newsom added. \"He's trying to roll back progress of the last century. He's trying to re-create the 19th century.\"\n\nNewsom has gone head to head with the president on a number of other issues since Trump took office this year, including his use of the military to act as civilian law enforcement in cities like Los Angeles and partisan redistricting efforts that favor Republicans.\n\nThe oil lease plan follows through on Trump's campaign promise to \"drill, baby, drill\" and increase domestic energy production, despite urgent warnings by scientists that burning fossil fuels, like oil and gas, will further heat the planet and exacerbate the climate crisis.",

        "title": "This supposed GOP silver bullet doesn't work, and other lessons from Dem election wins",
        "description": "Democrat Abigail Spanberger with her family on stage after her victory speech in Virginia. REUTERS/Jay Paul\n\nWithin hours of the 2024 presidential election, we saw lots of blame being thrown on Democrats' championing of LGBTQ rights and, in particular, trans rights, as a major reason for Kamala Harris's loss.\n\nThis, even as Harris hardly discussed trans rights. Incessant attention was nonetheless paid to one anti-trans ad that research even showed didn't actually effectively sway many voters.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Seth Moulton of Massachusetts was among the first of the critics, telling the New York Times days after the election, \"I have two little girls, I don't want them getting run over on a playing field by a male or formerly male athlete, but as a Democrat, I'm supposed to be afraid to say that.\"\n\nHis comments rightly sparked backlash, but he doubled down. We then saw story after story for months throughout 2025 about the Democrats' supposed \"trans problem.\"\n\nBut now, as he pursues a primary challenge against Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA), Moulton is singing a completely different tune, promising to \"support and lead legislation like the Transgender Bill of Rights.\" Moulton says he's, \"spoken with many in the trans community. I've listened, I've learned, and I understand why those words hurt people. I take responsibility for that.\"\n\nWhat happened?\n\nCertainly there's political opportunism here, as Moulton is taking on a liberal champion of LGBTQ rights. But there's also the realization in the past few months, as Republicans blitzed the airwaves in election campaigns with anti-trans ads but saw their polling unmoved, that this issue was blown way out of proportion. When a candidate like Harris loses by 1.4 percent in the popular vote, you can try to blame it on anything.But the election results last week have now proved it. We saw landslide\n\nThis played out in race after race last week, in state after state, and in local races for city council and town council. People were horrified by Trump's attack on democracy and his broken promises on the economy. That did in the GOP.\n\nThe GOP thought they had magic in a bottle after 2024 and spent millions on anti-LGBTQ ads that didn't work in 2025.\n\nWe expect Republicans to push hate and glom onto desperate lines of attack. But we should not accept it when Democrats impulsively buy it as well, and then cast blame, throwing marginalized groups under the bus.\n\nWe saw this from Governor Gavin Newsom of California and Democrats early this year, and from centrist groups like Third Way. Like Moulton, Newsom now seems to have dropped the anti-trans stuff, realizing there's more electoral gold in hitting Trump hard on his attacks on democracy and his broken promises on the economy.\n\nIn countering the misguided claims, I wrote after the election about how the LGBTQ vote grew in 2024 to a substantial 8 percent of the electorate, and voted for Harris by 86 percent, a big increase over Joe Biden. That's a powerful voting block, and, politically, it's smart for Democrats to court it rather than jettison it based on impulse. It's also the right thing to do.\n\nOn Monday on my SiriusXM program, the phones were flooded with callers angry about the Senate Democrats cowardly caving in on the shutdown and not getting the Obamacare subsidies extended. There's been a lot written about it, and about the eight Democrats who voted with the GOP, two of whom are retiring, and others not up for re-election for years -- and how it all looked orchestrated by leadership (Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY)) to protect incumbents up for re-election this year from angering the base. So I will not belabor that.\n\nI want to say that the discussion yesterday on the show was nuanced, with some people seeing the Democrats as having made their point and using the shutdown to their advantage, and some even said they won it. Republicans will now own the rising Obamacare premiums as there either won't be a promised vote or they will vote it down. Democrats, in their demand, were always giving Republicans something they needed, and many of the vulnerable GOP House members will be done in by this and everything else they've voted for with a gun to their heads by Trump and Mike Johnson.\n\nWe also saw Democrats listen to the base longer than they have in the past, keeping the shutdown going for long enough to raise awareness about the healthcare issue. It means they are responding to the base. Even if they collapsed, they're collapsing less quickly, and that's a good thing. We need to hash this out, certainly talk about new leadership, and then move on to bigger and dangerous fish to fry -- Trump and the GOP. The Washington Post has a story about how, on balance, Democrats have actually learned to fight back over the course of this year, listening to the base. Let's make sure they listen a lot more.\n\n... Mark Joseph Stern's piece on the Supreme Court, and Kim Davis's idiotic attempt to overturn marriage equality. It annoyed me that her long-shot challenge got the attention it did. Thousands of people unsuccessfully appeal to the Supreme Court each year. Too much of the media is portraying the court not taking the case as an example of the Supreme Court defending marriage equality. But Davis' case was never the case they were going to use to overturn Obergefell, and, more so, they are harming LGBTQ rights and gay and lesbian couples in so many other ways, and we can't lose sight of that.",

        "description": "Canadians are still boycotting travel to the United States and say there's \"no way we're going back\" while Donald Trump is in power.\n\n10 months on from the start of Trump's second term and it seems Canadians are still being cautious about holidaying in the US. Both last-minute holidaymakers and planned breaks abroad see members of the public avoiding the States, as they instead head further afield for their trips. The number of Canadians returning from the US by car and plane in September dropped by a third compared to the same month last year, according to The Economic Times.\n\nCanadian holidaymakers have since shed some light on why they are avoiding the US, with some fearing ICE Agents and rising travel costs. Nathalie Morisseau says the US is currently \"not attractive\" as a place to holiday in, and she even considers it \"scary.\" She added, \"With my father being Haitian, there's a certain fear around being able to go to the United States.\"\n\nAmericans are trying to appeal to Canadians with little success. Governor Gavin Newsom launched the \"California loves Canada\" drive, but Senior VP of Visit California Ryan Becker says it hasn't worked. Figures show a drop of $700 million on the expected spend from Canadian visitors to California.\n\nBecker said, \"That's a gut punch to the industry.\" Canadian services are suffering too as a result of the travel downturn. Will McAleer, executive director of the Travel Health Insurance Association of Canada, said, \"Canadians are really choosing destinations other than the US to travel.\" The group found that just 10% of baby boomers have plans to head to the US this winter, a drop of two-thirds compared to last year.\n\nNot all Canadians are avoiding the US though, with younger residents heading to the States but not publicly profiling their trip as they once would have. Travel blogger Barry Choi explained this quieter change is because travelling to the US is still \"cheaper\" than holidays to other continents.\n\nChoi said, \"Going to Orlando Disney is probably cheaper than going to Tokyo Disney.\" Weather could play a part in bringing Canadians down to the US, with Jill Wykes, editor of Snowbird Advisor, suggesting the first snowstorm of the year will be a major factor in changing Canadian travel plans.\n\nShe said, \"We haven't even had the first snowstorm yet. That normally makes people want to go.\"",

        "title": "Letter to the editor: We need constitutional obedience, not a convention",
        "description": "I strongly disagree with Cal Thomas' endorsement of the convention of the states (\"Time for a second American revolution,\" Web, Nov. 10). Such a convention cannot be limited; it would put everything in the Constitution up for grabs, including the method of ratification.\n\nThe purpose of an amendment to the Constitution is to correct a problem in the Constitution. Article I, Section 8 already places limits on what Congress can spend money on. The 10th Amendment already prohibits the U.S. government from legislating in the areas of education or health care in any way, at any time, for any reason.\n\nThe problem is not in the Constitution itself; it is that the Constitution is not being obeyed. Article V will not deal with that. Why would anyone think that if just a few more amendments were added, people who have been disregarding the Constitution will suddenly start to obey it?\n\nArticle V actually says that the states can only apply for the convention; it is Congress that would call it. Congress could assert that it has the authority to select the delegates, time and place of the meeting and the topics to be considered. Even if the states do select the delegates, what sort would current state governments send? I live in Maryland, and I believe our legislature would be far more likely to send a Bernie Sanders, Gavin Newsom or Elizabeth Warren than it would a Thomas Jefferson or James Madison. The political left would love to do away with the Electoral College and the Bill of Rights.\n\nThe 1787 Convention is the only precedent we have. Its delegates received commissions only to propose amendments to the Articles of Confederation. They instead created an entirely new document to replace the Articles altogether. Article 13 of the Articles required unanimous ratification by the states for any amendment to be approved. However, the delegates changed the rules, reducing the number from all to three-quarters. A new convention could and probably would do the same. One person has recommended 15 of the 20 most populous states. Another recommends a popular vote by the people.\n\nThe real solution is not Article V; it is Article VI, which requires every government official - U.S., state and local, elected and appointed - to swear an oath of office to obey and protect the Constitution. We need to hold our officials accountable to the Constitution and their oaths of office. I strongly recommend The New American's Freedom Index, which is updated twice a year and gives the voting record of each member of Congress in terms of fidelity to the Constitution and to their oaths of office.",

        "title": "Donald Trump Is a Lamer Duck Than Ever",
        "description": "For a president who wants to project vigor and command at all times, Donald Trump made the worst possible spectacle of himself in the Oval Office last Thursday.\n\nIt came in the form of two images captured during a press event to announce cheaper weight-loss drugs. The first materialized when a participant fainted and several officials on hand rushed over. Not Trump, however, who, after turning to look at the fallen man, stood a few feet away at the Resolute Desk with his back to the action, wearing an indifferent expression. This was pointedly reflected in news photos that instantly went viral.\n\nThe second image, less noticed but possibly more damning, was memorialized just beforehand: As Mehmet Oz, the administration's head of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, delivered remarks, Trump appeared to be nodding off at his desk. The Washington Post, in keeping with its dogged Watergate-era traditions, undertook a thorough \"analysis of multiple video feeds\" and confirmed that, indeed, the 79-year-old president had \"spent nearly 20 minutes apparently battling to keep his eyes open.\"\n\n\"He put his hand on his temple,\" the Post investigation concluded. \"He slouched in his chair.\"\n\nBrian C. Kalt: The solution to the third-term threat\n\nThe White House denied that the president had been asleep, echoing Trump's past sensitivities toward perceived somnolence. But there was something else going on here. The administration has sought to portray Trump as the main driver of all events at all times -- potent, essential, and fully engaged. If there has been one unified message coming out of this White House, it's been that of a presidency in perpetual motion. Yet Trump has looked much less daunting and invincible in recent days. He has been criticized for appearing checked out and oblivious to the economic hardships facing Americans, a sentiment reinforced by voters last Tuesday. Above all, Trump, who is not eligible to run for reelection in 2028 -- at least that's what some people think -- is loath to be seen as a lame duck. And yet, he is a lamer duck now than he was just a short while ago.\n\nLast week was rough for Trump in that regard. Republicans suffered election routs in the Virginia and New Jersey governor's races, as well as in a statewide ballot initiative pushed by California Governor Gavin Newsom. It wasn't only that Democrats prevailed by massive margins or that the results confirmed that Trump's second-term act was playing terribly with a critical mass of Americans, including many of those who'd voted for him. The GOP's losses suddenly made Trump look vulnerable. By my informal estimation (without the benefit of \"multiple video feeds\"), \"lame duck\" was applied more often to Trump last week than in any prior stretch of his second term.\n\n\"Donald Trump Enters His Lame Duck Era,\" declared one post-election headline in Politico. The accompanying article cataloged recent signs of Republican defiance of Trump. It led with a scene in which the president summoned Senate Republicans to the White House and demanded that they eliminate the filibuster. \"Upon returning to the Capitol, the senators made it very clear: they planned to blow Trump off,\" according to Politico. (Mike Rounds of South Dakota apparently \"laughed out loud.\")\n\nNo officeholder welcomes being labeled a lame duck. From its earliest adoption, the phrase has never been meant as a term of flattery. Senator Lazarus Powell of Kentucky is credited with the first political usage, in 1863, when he described the U.S. Court of Claims as \"a receptacle of 'lame ducks' or broken down politicians.\" Over time, lame duck evolved into more of a time marker, referring to an elected official completing their final phase in office.\n\nThat's the clinical definition, at least. But lame duck also carries deeper connotations of diminishing cachet, relating to a leader's lost status and creeping powerlessness. These notions are especially toxic to Trump. Since returning to the White House, he has governed with unchecked abandon, enjoying the total compliance and indulgence of his party. Nowhere has this been more evident than among Republicans in Congress, who have given every impression of living in abject fear of Trump, his loyalty enforcers, and his voters.\n\nIt is not difficult to see how being discussed as a weakened short-timer would inflict particular psychic injury upon Trump. Such a status represents an intolerable affront not only to his own grandiosity but also to his political power. Trump and his allies have worked to foster a sense of unquestioned authority and even permanence. Whether or not he is serious about running for a third term, he has been happy to publicly entertain the prospect. \"Most any Republican is too intimidated to suggest he might not run again,\" Ed Rogers, a longtime GOP lobbyist and former aide to Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush, told me. Having this unconstitutional gambit in circulation became a strategic taunt after a while, \"to keep people glancing at each other, asking, 'Could he do it?'\" Rogers said. \"This has caused a pause on the traditional creep of lame-duckedness.\"\n\nTrump was more definitive when the third-term prospect came up last month, admitting that he wouldn't be allowed to run. But Tuesday's election results struck a blow against his sense of almighty armor. \"Trump's Superman mythology just had 100 pounds of kryptonite shoved down its throat,\" Mike Murphy, a vehemently anti-Trump Republican media consultant, told me.\n\nBeyond the undertones of lost influence, being a lame duck can also suggest a president distracted, disengaged, and biding time. Again, these notions would seem anathema to everything Trump wants to convey. Theoretically, at least.\n\nVoters keep identifying the high cost of living as their chief concern. Trump, meanwhile, has displayed a Marie Antoinette-like indifference to the economic struggles that so many Americans keep mentioning. He has recently devoted time to overseeing the construction of a new White House patio and ballroom, hosting a Great Gatsby-themed party at Mar-a-Lago, and reportedly trying to have the future home stadium of the Washington Commanders named after him.\n\n\"His gold-leaf excess and 'Let 'em eat cake' tone-deafness will likely wear ever thinner,\" Mark Updegrove, a presidential historian and the head of the LBJ Foundation, told me. Updegrove, the author of a book titled Second Acts: Presidential Lives and Legacies After the White House, predicted that Trump would never \"back off his ballroom ambitions,\" regardless of how they might be perceived. Trump clearly enjoys the idea that he can build and adorn as he pleases. He will insist on these projects, Updegrove said, \"like a toddler unwilling to surrender a lollipop.\"\n\nTom Nichols: A confederacy of toddlers\n\nTrump's Oval Office photo snafu notwithstanding, even casual observers would expect that he will do everything possible to keep himself at center stage for as long as he can. Histrionics are definitely possible. \"Like the mob boss with terminal cancer\" is Murphy's comparison, by which he means that Trump will be sure to make himself dangerous to anyone who questions his full authority and treats him as a lame duck.\n\nThis almost certainly will extend to the 2028 campaign. Trump almost certainly will insist on full deference from any Republican hoping to succeed him. He almost certainly will devote zero energy to things like \"building the Republican bench\" or \"grooming his successor\" or \"extending gracious gestures to his worthy Democratic adversaries.\"\n\nAnd the term lame duck will almost certainly remain verboten around the White House until the minute Trump departs the premises for good -- assuming that he ever does.",

        "description": "Two days after agitators violently disrupted a TPUSA event in Berkeley, California, the state's governor, Gavin Newsom, has yet to issue a public comment on the matter.\n\nThe incident unfolded on Monday night on the campus of UC Berkeley at a Turning Point event featuring actor Rob Schneider and author Frank Turek, a Christian mentor of the organization's late founder, Charlie Kirk. Left-wing agitators swarmed Zellerbach Hall where the event, which was the last stop on the \"This is the Turning Point\" tour, was held.\n\nFour students at the university were arrested, according to The Daily Californian, which omitted the suspects' names from its report. They were described as females between the ages of 20 and 22. Each was reportedly charged with felony vandalism.\n\nThe UC Berkeley Police Department confirmed that two other men were arrested during the night's activities.\n\nFETTERMAN FIRES BACK AT NEWSOM AFTER SHUTDOWN CRITICISM, REFUSES TO 'PLAY CHICKEN' WITH THE LIVES OF AMERICANS\n\nChristopher Joseph Benton, 48, who is unaffiliated with the school, was arrested for trespassing, resisting or obstructing an officer and being unlawfully present on campus, all misdemeanors.\n\nJay Eduardo Maytorena, 22, listed as a current or former student, was arrested for trespassing and resisting or obstructing an officer.\n\nSeveral of the skirmishes at the event went viral, including a man caught on video beating a Turning Point USA supporter who was arrested and charged with violent crimes.\n\nPolice said that upon further investigation, the second man involved in the fight was attempting to rob the victim of his necklace.\n\n\"After speaking with the involved parties and corroborating information through open-source media footage, officers determined that one of the men -- Jihad Dphrepaulezz (a 25-year-old Oakland man) had stolen the other man's chain from around his neck,\" police said. \"The other man was attempting to get his chain back from Dphrepaulezz.\"\n\nGAVIN NEWSOM TELLS DEMOCRATS THEY 'WALKED AWAY' FROM MASCULINITY CRISIS IMPACTING MEN AND BOYS\n\nNewsom, who is in Brazil attending the COP 30 climate conference, has not posted about the disruption of the event, which conservatives have labeled as an assault on free speech.\n\nFox News Digital reached out to Newsom's office for comment but did not immediately receive a response.\n\nNewsom famously sat down for an interview with Kirk before the conservative commentator was murdered, and the two briefly touched on free speech while discussing TikTok. Newsom raised concerns about teachers \"policing speech\" in classrooms.\n\n\"Grateful this level of attention being paid to what happened to our students last night at UC Berkeley,\" Turning Point USA's Andrew Kolvet posted on X.\n\n\"No one attending a peaceful event should be subjected to the type of harassment and attacks we saw last night. The Antifa thugs who did this MUST be stopped.\"\n\nThe Department of Justice announced it is investigating the campus chaos.\n\n\"Mob assault and thuggish intimidation of attendees exercising their First Amendment rights are unacceptable,\" Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon wrote in a post announcing the probe on X.\n\nCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe DOJ has demanded that the school preserve all records related to security and campus preparation for the Turning Point event.\n\nIn a lengthy statement provided to Fox News Digital, UC Berkeley strongly condemned all violence and threats that may chill freedom of speech. It also said it will cooperate with the federal investigation.\n\n\"The University is conducting a full investigation and intends to fully cooperate with and assist any federal investigations and the FBI-led Joint Terrorism Task Force to identify the outside agitators responsible for attempting to disrupt last night's TPUSA event,\" the statement said. \"UC Berkeley will take all appropriate steps to safeguard the right of every member of our community to speak and assemble freely.\"",

        "title": "Letter to the editor: How Youngkin could get Trump's presidential endorsement",
        "description": "Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin lost two of the three congressional races he targeted in 2022 and both houses of the General Assembly in 2023. He refused to step up and take out Sen. Tim Kaine in 2024, got shellacked in 2025 and has allowed for the 2026 loss of at least two more congressional seats. But I suspect all of this losing may end up paying off for the nation in 2028.\n\nHopefully, President Trump will continue to disrupt the ossified federal government for the next three years and, unfortunately, upset a majority of Americans. Accordingly, Vice President JD Vance and/or Secretary of State Marco Rubio may catch much of the anger toward Mr. Trump.\n\nMr. Youngkin, by contrast, having not hurt Democrats for at least five years in a row, may be an attractive candidate for president in the general election. I suspect Mr. Trump may already know this. (Keep in mind that he Trump likes tall, good-looking, wealthy people.) Mr. Trump's endorsement would easily give Mr. Youngkin the Republican nomination. And Mr. Youngkin may have the best chance of beating Gavin Newsom.\n\nBut Mr. Youngkin, please consider making it easier for President Trump to endorse you. First, restore the name of Patrick Henry Community College. Henry is a favorite of President Trump. Mike Lindell has told me that every other time he speaks to Mr. Trump, the president calls Mr. Lindell a modern-day Patrick Henry. State Board of Community Colleges Chairman Mike Wooten, a Black retired Marine Corps Major, is waiting for your green light.\n\nYou could also urge Mr. Trump to tell Attorney General Pam Bondi to release the Marvin Bush-Mark Warner criminal files, which would force Mr. Warner's retirement. If you do it soon, could force it while you have the power to appoint Mr. Warner's replacement.\n\nThe Warner criminal file contains evidence of state crimes committed surrounding the Battle Creek Landfill in Page County, where former Virginia House Speaker Todd Gilbert works as an assistant commonwealth's attorney. Surely he and Richard Cullen could work out another grand bargain to keep my former boss and friend Mark Warner, now 70, out of prison.\n\nLt. Col. BRADLEY G. POLLACK\n\nU.S. Marine Corps Reserve (retired)",

        "title": "Jack Schlossberg succeeded in 'trolling for a cause.' Now, he's running for Congress",
        "description": "During his 1961 inaugural address, John F. Kennedy famously implored a new generation of Americans to serve their country. Almost 64 years later, Jack Schlossberg, his only grandson, is now heeding the call for generational change from Democratic voters as the party's leaders continue to cling to office well into their 70s.\n\nSchlossberg, 32, announced Wednesday morning in a video posted to social media that he's running for the House seat of 78-year-old Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., who is set to retire after 34 years representing the heart of Manhattan. The video was not cheeky, controversial and eyebrow raising as much of his content as \"JackUno\" often is.\n\nInstead, Schlossberg notified his nearly 800,000 follower in a serious and earnest tone of his desire to represent his hometown district and fight against the Trump administration from within the halls of Congress.\n\n\"It's certainly time for a new generation of Americans to step up and ask what they can do for their country,\" Schlossberg said in an interview with MSNBC ahead of his announcement. \"And I think that it shouldn't just be about someone's age. It should be specifically about young candidates -- any age candidates -- who understand policy and how to compete in this political environment, which is toxic.\"\n\nLike other Democrats, Schlossberg sees President Donald Trump's policies and behavior as causing what he called corruption, affordability and constitutional crises. But unlike other elected Democrats and candidates, the New York City native is leaning into his influencer credentials to fuel his first run for elected office. He sees taking it to Trump on social media as not just clickbait but a necessity in an attention economy dominated by right-wing X posters, podcasters and YouTube influencers spreading the Trump gospel.\n\n\"One thing we can do is elect candidates who know how to communicate and cut back in this toxic political environment that we find ourselves in,\" Schlossberg said. \"New media is completely polluted and the air is dirty. I figured out a way to breathe in that environment, and we need to elect candidates who understand how to do that, and I think that's what makes me an effective representative.\"\n\nSchlossberg isn't shying away from the personal nature of the fight against Trump -- who has sought to dismantle the Kennedy legacy -- or against his cousin, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who Trump appointed Health and Human Services secretary after a failed presidential run that was Camelot-coded.\n\nSchlossberg's online following ballooned last year, in the lead-up to the 2024 presidential election, as he tried on various characters and presented his followers with accented impersonations. He was the first in his family to publicly criticize his cousin, and drew attention for trolling the now-HHS secretary and Trumpism.\n\nSchlossberg also appeared as a surrogate on the 2024 campaign trail, spending the months ahead of the election traveling the country and making cameos in viral videos with elected officials in hopes of turning out young voters. Schlossberg's \"trolling for a cause\" model, as he called it, recently has been embraced by high-profile Democrats such as California Gov. Gavin Newsom and others who have started posting slightly unhinged or lacerating social media messages directed at Trump and MAGA world, oftentimes in all caps and with exaggerated punctuation.\n\n\"In the lead-up to the 2024 election, I saw a problem that I wanted to do something about, and that's that the internet and new media is dominated by the right -- and it has been for a decade,\" said Schlossberg. \"I want to offer a different perspective, an alternative perspective, and get the Democratic Party's message out there to reach people. So I use my own creativity, a little bit of courage, to put my neck out there and speak up for what I believe in. And I learned a lot doing that.\"\n\nBut Schlossberg's in-real-life takeaway from his experience on the campaign trail wasn't as sarcastic or mischievous, departing from his online brand.\n\n\"I learned that the Democratic Party is not dead or dying there,\" he added. \"I met thousands of people across the country. I went to almost every single swing state, and I met people, young and old, who are excited to join our cause and do whatever they can to stop this president from enacting his agenda.\"\n\nSchlossberg joins a growing primary field for Nadler's heavily Democratic district in which a primary win is tantamount to victory. Micah Lasher, a New York state assembly member and Nadler prot\u00e9g\u00e9, jumped into the race in September, along with Liam Elkind, a 26-year-old nonprofit founder. Nadler told The New York Times last month that any endorsement of a successor \"is way down the road.\"\n\nIf elected, Schlossberg could serve in Congress while his cousin holds a Cabinet position. As HHS secretary, RFK Jr. has departed radically from his uncle's Democratic legacy, slashing health research funding, laying off hundreds of federal workers, and weakening vaccine policy. Schlossberg argued that fighting the Trump administration is not just about his family's legacy, but about the \"generations of Americans and New Yorkers who fought and sacrificed to build this country.\"",

        "description": "Lara Trump compared Sen. John Fetterman to her father-in-law, President Trump, on Tuesday after praising the Pennsylvania Democrat for voting with Republicans to end the government shutdown and ably defending himself from criticism leveled by \"The View\" co-host Sunny Hostin.\n\nFetterman broke ranks with Democratic leadership and voted with Republican senators 15 times to reopen the government before the upper chamber finally pushed through a legislative package Monday that would fund the government through Jan. 30, 2026, if approved by the House.\n\n\"It's so refreshing, Martha, to see that there is someone like John Fetterman out there, a politician who does the right thing, regardless of the pressure he feels from his own party or a TV host like Sonny Hostin,\" Lara Trump said during an appearance on Fox News' \"The Story with Martha MacCallum.\"\n\n\"They are getting aggressive with him as well,\" the president's daughter-in-law continued.\n\n\"He reminds me of someone else I know, his name is Donald J. Trump.\"\n\nFetterman appeared on ABC's \"The View\" earlier in the day and was criticized by Hostin over his efforts to end the record-long lapse in federal funding.\n\nHostin likened his and other Democratic lawmakers' dealings with the GOP to bringing \"a butter knife to a gunfight,\" and referenced criticisms from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and California Gov. Gavin Newsom, and said Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) \"blamed the GOP\" for the shutdown.\n\n\"MTG is quite literally the last person in America that I'm going to take advice or to get their kinds of my leadership and values from,\" Fetterman shot back. \"Now, if Democrats are celebrating crazy pants like that, then that's on them.\n\n\"Now, I don't need a lecture from, whether it's Bernie or the governor in California, because they are representing very deep-blue kinds of populations and a lot of those things were part of the extreme.\"\n\nFetterman then doubled down.\n\n\"I refuse to weaponize the SNAP benefit for 42 million Americans that rely on feeding themselves and their family, or making flying in America, you know, less safe, or I refuse not to pay our military and all of the unions attached to all of this, and people. So for me it's like I don't agree with that tactic to respond to circumstances that we're confronting on this.\"\n\nLara, married to first son Eric Trump, explained that Fetterman's \"authenticity\" and willingness to \"stand up and fight for the right things\" are what \"people love.\"\n\n\"When I sat down with him for an interview for my show, he talked about the fact that he doesn't ever agree, no matter who's at fault, with shutting down the government,\" she continued, noting \"the havoc\" that the shutdown \"wreaked across our country.\"\n\nThe former Republican National Committee co-chair and current Fox News host argued that Democrats \"would rather make a political play\" make the country \"hurt\" than \"do something that is right.\"\n\n\"And I think it's really nice that you have John Fetterman out there who at one time, Martha, we all looked at and said, he's kind of fringe, he's kind of far left - he's now the most common sense in the Democrat Party and how refreshing it is that he's continuing to be that way,\" Lara added.",

He declined to answer questions about a possible run for president, saying he was more concerned about the upcoming mid-term U.S. congressional elections.\n\n\"I don't worry about 2028. I worry about fair and free elections. I'm more worried about 2026 and taking back the House of Representatives and getting the speakership,\" he told reporters on the sidelines of COP30.\n\nHe said he was alarmed that eight of his fellow Democrats in the U.S. Senate \"rolled over\" to vote to support an end to the U.S. government shutdown. But he did not say whether he supported calls by some Democrats to replace Senator Chuck Schumer as the party's Senate leader.\n\nCALIFORNIA VS. WASHINGTON\n\nCalifornia is just one of 50 U.S. states, but its economy is the world's fourth-largest, making it a key player in influencing markets and energy policy.\n\nDressed casually in a white business shirt in the sweltering tropical heat, Newsom made a point of listing climate actions made by two Republican presidents from California, Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon.\n\nWhile Democrats have long made climate change a central part of their policy priorities, Newsom said the messaging needs to change so average citizens can connect with the issue on factors such as economics and cost, making them less vulnerable to climate skeptics like Trump.\n\n\"Climate change seems abstract. We need to talk in terms that people understand,\" Newsom said.\n\nItem 1 of 2 California Governor Gavin Newsom attends the UN Climate Change Conference (COP30), in Belem, Brazil, November 11, 2025.

        "title": "Newsom Storms Climate Conference and Assails Trump as a 'Bully'",
        "description": "Gov. Gavin Newsom of California on Tuesday cast himself as the \"stable and reliable\" American partner to the world, called a reported White House proposal to open offshore drilling in the waters off California \"disgraceful\" and urged his fellow Democrats to recast climate change as a \"cost of living issue.\"\n\nMr. Newsom, a Democrat who is widely considered to be weighing a 2028 presidential bid, used his appearance at the United Nations climate summit in Bel\u00e9m, Brazil, to paint President Trump as a threat to American competitiveness by letting China dominate electric vehicles, solar panels and other clean energy technologies of the future.\n\n\"The United States of America better wake up at that,\" Mr. Newsom said at one of his many packed sessions at the climate conference, known as COP30. \"It's not about electric power. It's about economic power. We, as the state of California, are not going to cede that race to China.\"\n\nWhile the Trump administration opted not to send any representatives to the summit, China is using its pavilion inside the event to promote its successes.\n\nTaylor Rogers, a White House spokeswoman, criticized Mr. Newsom, saying he \"flew all the way to Brazil to tout the Green New Scam, while Californians are paying some of the highest energy prices in the country.\" In a statement, she said \"these Green Dreams are killing other countries, but will not kill ours thanks to President Trump's commonsense energy agenda.\"\n\nAs the most prominent American official at the summit, Mr. Newsom was trailed by crowds at the conference. Going from one packed event to the next, the governor stopped to talk to admirers, waved to an applauding crowd at one point and entertained questions from the media, with the United Nations security detail having trouble getting him to events on time. It was his first appearance at an international climate conference and it was all the more notable because of the absence of an official United States delegation.\n\n\"Donald Trump didn't show up at COP30 but California did,\" Mr. Newsom said.\n\nMr. Trump has disavowed global climate cooperation by withdrawing the United States from the Paris climate accord, pressured other countries to buy more American oil and gas and blocked renewable energy projects at home.\n\nMr. Newsom called the administration's pullout from the global pact \"an abomination.\" The United States is the only country to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, in which 194 other nations pledged to keep global warming to relatively safe levels.\n\nThe governor's series of events ended shortly before a group of Indigenous protesters forced their way into the venue and clashed with security guards at the entrance, according to Reuters. They were protesting the incursion of mining, logging and agriculture in forested lands.\n\nThe governor said nothing about his national ambitions, even when asked directly, insisting that he was focused on ensuring that next year's midterm elections were not undermined by the Trump administration. Mr. Newsom's trip to Bel\u00e9m came on the heels of a successful ballot initiative that could help California Democrats flip up to five congressional seats.\n\n\"If there's one message I want to deliver to all of you, it is that California distinguishes itself from the current occupant in the White House in Washington, D.C.,\" Mr. Newsom said. \"California is a stable and reliable partner.\"\n\nCalifornia produces more electricity from renewable energy, including solar and wind power, than any state except Texas. It established the country's first statewide cap-and-trade program, a system that allows polluters to trade permits for emissions, which Mr. Newsom recently extended to 2045.\n\nThe governor waded into issues well beyond the confines of California and climate change. He said it was \"chilling\" to see images of U.S. bombardment of suspected drug ships off the coast of Venezuela without congressional approval. He called Mr. Trump a \"bully.\"\n\nHe urged climate advocates, including in his own party, to reframe the way they talk about climate change, less in abstract terms and more as a force that affects people's pocketbooks.\n\n\"It's about affordability. It's about time we frame it accordingly,\" Mr. Newsom said of his efforts to ramp up renewable energy in his state. \"We're here to frame it in economic terms, in cost-of-living terms.\"\n\nThe Biden administration's sweeping investment in electric vehicles and renewable energy did not resonate with voters in 2024. \"We have some work to do as a party, as a nation,\" Mr. Newsom said.\n\nIn fact, concerns about the cost of fuel in California forced Mr. Newsom to go easy on oil and gas lately. Just two years ago, Mr. Newsom was a combative critic of the fossil fuel industry. In 2023, the state sued ExxonMobil, Shell, BP, ConocoPhillips and others, alleging that they had misled the public about climate change.\n\nBut this year, Mr. Newsom enacted changes to make it easier to drill for oil. Asked about that contradiction on Tuesday, he said it was a \"pragmatic\" move endorsed by the State Legislature.\n\nHe said he would sue, if necessary, to block a reported White House proposal to issue oil drilling permits off the coast of California. \"Dead on arrival,\" Mr. Newsom said. He noted that Mr. Trump had not proposed offshore drilling off the coast near Mar-a-Lago, his resort in Florida.\n\n\"Disgraceful,\" Mr. Newsom said.\n\nIvan Penn contributed reporting from S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil.",

As it relates to offshore oil drilling, it's overwhelmingly opposed by members of all political parties in the state of California. What's fascinating to me -- you may have seen this -- he wants to open offshore oil drilling, and he intentionally aligned that to opening of COP. Well, his weakness, by the way, masquerading as strength, that's all that was. But the answer to your question. Forgive the long-winded answer. It's dead on arrival -- dead on arrival.

        "title": "AP Interview: Newsom says Trump climate-fighting absence is 'doubling down on stupid'",
        "description": "BELEM, Brazil -- Calling America's absence from key United Nations climate negotiations \"doubling down on stupid,\" California Gov. Gavin Newsom said Tuesday the United States risks being left behind as an economic power.\n\nNewsom, a Democrat eyeing a 2028 presidential run, is so far the highest profile of several U.S. governors and mayors at U.N. climate talks being hosted in Belem, Brazil. They say they are here to tell the 195 nations who are trying to fight climate change that much of the United States is doing its best despite Trump administration policies overturning environmental regulations and aiding the production of dirty fuels, such as coal, while stymying green energies like wind and solar.\n\nAs he did during his first term, President Donald Trump is also pulling America from the 2015 Paris Agreement, which set international goals to limit average global temperature rise.\n\nNewsom's presence as governor of the most populous U.S. state serves to draw a clear contrast with Trump's absence. He said Trump's decision to skip the talks tells the world: \"You don't matter, we don't care.\"\n\n\"This idea that somehow we can put up walls, we can put up barriers, we could put up tariffs, we put up our middle fingers and just turn our back is lunacy,\" Newsom said during an exclusive Associated Press interview at the climate talks in Belem, a city on the edge of the Amazon rainforest. \"And every other country in the world understands that. That's why every other country in this world is moving in a different direction.\"\n\nEven Russia and Saudi Arabia get it and are going green, but not Trump, Newsom said. U.N. organizers said only four nations are absent from the negotiations called COP30: Strife-torn Afghanistan and Myanmar, tiny San Marino and the United States, which over the century has put more heat-trapping carbon dioxide in the air than any other nation.\n\nPHOTOS: AP Interview: Newsom says Trump climate-fighting absence is 'doubling down on stupid'\n\nCalifornia, with nearly 40 million residents, is a major economic hub and on the forefront of national climate policy. But the Trump administration has sought to role back the state's power to set aggressive climate policy, most notably by blocking a California regulation to ban the sale of new gas-powered cars within the next decade.\n\n\"This Trump administration, his acolytes and the supine Congress led by Speaker (Mike) Johnson, are doubling down on stupid,\" Newsom said.\n\n\"We're ceding cheap energy, green energy, infrastructure, supply chain manufacturing. We're ceding economic power to other countries, notably China, taking advantage of that absence,\" Newsom said. \"And they're going to clean our clock economically unless we wake up to the economic imperative and opportunities of low carbon regrowth.\"\n\nTrump, who actively solicited money from the fossil fuel industry during his last campaign, has massively deregulated industry that spews heat-trapping gas and cut subsidies to renewable energy. This would give America -- the No. 1 oil producer in the world -- energy independence and cheaper prices, he has said.\n\n\"Governor Newscum flew all the way to Brazil to tout the Green New Scam, while the people of California are paying some of the highest energy prices in the country. Embarrassing!,\" White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said in a statement, using one of Trump's favored nicknames for Newsom. \"President Trump will not allow the best interest of the American people to be jeopardized by the Green Energy Scam. These Green Dreams are killing other countries, but will not kill ours thanks to President Trump's common sense energy agenda.\"\n\nClimate change is undeniable, despite Trump calling it a hoax, Newsom said.\n\n\"If you don't believe in science, and a lot of people apparently don't, you have to believe in your own eyes,\" Newsom said. \"Nighttime temperatures, record-breaking heat globally, acidification of our oceans, impacts on our coral reefs. You're not able to go where your grandfather brought you for the first time, your dad brought you and bring your kids because there's another fire and it's another closure and the air quality's been degraded.\"\n\nCalifornia has warmed 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit (1 degree Celsius) in the past 30 years and gets nearly 7 inches of rain (17.7 centimeters) less now than it did in 1995, according to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration records.\n\nSome of California's largest and most destructive wildfires in history have sparked in the last five years, including two January infernos that devastated neighborhoods in and around Los Angeles. The previous winter, meanwhile, brought record-breaking rainfall as multiple atmospheric rivers pounded the state.\n\n\"I'm just privileged to represent one of the most blessed and cursed states in the world that's on the tip of the spear of the impacts of climate change,\" Newsom said. \"How about the simultaneous crisis of wildfires, drought, and floods stacked on top of each other.\"\n\n\"Anyone paying attention here?\" added Newsom.\n\nAt home, Newsom has confronted the economic and political realities of pursuing the state's ambitious goal of by 2045 reaching carbon neutrality, or taking as much carbon pollution from the atmosphere as emitted. He recently signed legislation to boost oil production in part of the state and his party has grappled with how to confront high gas prices. California also has some of the highest electricity rates in the country.\n\nCalifornia is also dealing with the massive energy and water demands of data centers by keeping its last nuclear plant running longer than planned, adding huge chunks of solar power and battery storage and investing in nuclear fusion, Newsom said. Those energy needs will grow as AI continues to boom. Many of the nation's top AI companies are headquartered in California.\n\nVeteran climate negotiations analyst Alden Meyer of the European think tank E3G said it was unfortunate that America's federal government was not participating in the talks.\n\n\"But it is very positive that we have these other leaders from the United States that are here in Belem,\" he said.\n\n___\n\nAnton L.

        "description": "Daniel Turner joins Jimmy Failla on Fox Across America to share his thoughts on the start of the UN Climate Change Conference in Brazil.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom was the most prominent American official to attend the COP30 global climate conference in Bel\u00e9m, Brazil, this week -- using the platform to criticize the absent Trump administration.\n\nThe White House mocked the trip, noting California's continued rank among the highest in U.S. energy costs.\n\nNewsom's office put out a summary of his visit to the conference, saying it shows California is \"leading by example\" and proving that \"climate action and economic growth go hand in hand.\"\n\n\"As Donald Trump abandons American climate leadership, California continues and accelerates its climate action, urging global investors to embrace the technologies and infrastructure driving the clean energy future,\" his office said in the release.\n\nNEWSOM SET TO RALLY TEXAS DEMS WITH VICTORY LAP DAYS AFTER PROP 50 PASSES: 'CALIFORNIA STEPPED UP'\n\nOn Tuesday, Newsom was scheduled to deliver remarks in his role as co-chair of America Is All In, which describes itself as a broad coalition of non-federal actors in the U.S. committed to ambitious climate action. Later, he was scheduled to attend a state-governor's coalition called U.S. Climate Alliance, and then travel into the Amazon rainforest to meet with \"community stewards.\"\n\n\"While Donald Trump is handing the future to China, California is proving that climate action, business growth, supporting workers, and good-paying jobs go hand in hand,\" Newsom said.\n\n\"We're not turning backwards to the failed policies of the past -- California is fighting for a clean-energy future, even as President Trump bends the knee to his Gulf-State patrons and takes a nap as the world burns.\"\n\nNEWSOM SAYS TRUMP HAS 'RELENTLESS, UNHINGED' OBSESSION WITH CALIFORNIA DURING STATE OF THE STATE ADDRESS\n\nNewsom made the case during remarks at the coinciding Milken Institute Global Investors Symposium in Sao Paulo that California has proved it can balance climate and environmental stewardship with economic growth.\n\n\"We're running the fourth-largest economy in the world [on] 67%; two-thirds clean energy,\" he said.\n\nNewsom claimed that nine out of 10 days this year, California operated on 100% non-fossil-fuel energy for at least part of the day:\n\nTRUMP OFFICIALS URGED TO BOYCOTT UN CLIMATE SUMMIT AS TRUMP SEETHES CLIMATE CHANGE IS A 'CON JOB'\n\n\"I don't know if there's another jurisdiction in the world that can lay claim to that.\"\n\n\"We are proving the paradigm: The genius of 'and,' not the tyranny of 'or',\" he said in remarks to Milken CEO Rich Ditizio.\n\nMeanwhile, back in Washington, White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers cited California's consumer energy costs, and claimed that Newsom would not be attending such a summit if he was sincere about the issue as thousands of acres reportedly had to be cleared for a \"special purpose highway\" into the rainforest.\n\nNEWSOM WARNS AMERICANS 'YOU WILL LOSE YOUR COUNTRY' UNDER TRUMP AT CALIFORNIA SUMMIT\n\nBelem officials denied the highway, Avenida Liberdade, was built expressly for the summit, according to reports.\n\n\"Governor Newscum (sic) flew all the way to Brazil to tout the Green New Scam, while the people of California are paying some of the highest energy prices in the country: Embarrassing,\" Rogers said.\n\n\"It's time for Newscum and other countries to drop the climate fa\u00e7ade.

Jay Inslee claimed to the COP30 conference that the U.S. has not pulled out of the Paris climate accords.\n\n\"One part of the United States has, and that's the federal government,\" he told Germany's Deutsche Welle.\n\n\"It's not an honest organization looking to better human lives,\" Wright said, adding that he may drop in on the 2026 conference to deliver some \"common sense.\"",

John Fetterman, D-Pa., on Tuesday on why he voted to end the government shutdown, accusing him of bringing a butter knife to a \"gunfight.\"\n\nHostin quoted Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Gov. Gavin Newsom, D-Calif., who both criticized the decision by eight senators to vote to end the shutdown. She also said Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., \"blamed the GOP.\"\n\n\"As you mentioned, Democrats had big wins last week, so you had momentum. Why give in now? Why bring a butter knife to a gunfight? Are you willing to gamble that the GOP will negotiate on healthcare in good faith once the government reopens? Because if that gamble is wrong, half a million Pennsylvanians that you represent, their healthcare costs will skyrocket if you are wrong,\" Hostin said. \"I believe you are wrong.\"\n\nFetterman has consistently voted with the GOP senators to reopen the government throughout the 41-day shutdown.

Angus King, I-Maine, Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nev., Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., Maggie Hassan, D-N.H., Jacky Rosen, D-Nev., Tim Kaine, D-Va., and the number two Democrat in the Senate, Dick Durbin, D-Ill., who all voted on an updated CR that would end the shutdown.\n\n'THE VIEW' CO-HOST RAILS AGAINST DEMOCRATS AFTER ENDING SHUTDOWN, SAYS CHUCK SCHUMER'S 'DAYS ARE OVER'\n\n\"MTG is quite literally the last person in America that I'm going to take advice or to get their kinds of my leadership and values from.

        "description": "\"You had momentum. Why give in now?\" the ABC host asks the Democratic senator\n\nSenator John Fetterman was one of the handful of Democrats who opted to vote alongside Republicans to reopen the government over the weekend, and during his Tuesday appearance on \"The View,\" host Sunny Hostin called him out directly for it. According to the ABC host, he and his colleagues brought \"a butter knife to a gunfight.\"\n\nHostin was quick to point out that fellow Democrats like Sen. Bernie Sanders called the move a \"horrific mistake,\" while California governor Gavin Newsom called it \"pathetic\" and a \"surrender. The ABC host also questioned the decision following Democrats' sweeping victories on election night last Tuesday.\n\n\"Poll after poll found more Americans on both sides of the aisle blaming Republicans. Even Marjorie Taylor Greene blamed the GOP!\" Hostin said. \"As you mentioned, Democrats had big wins last week. So you had momentum. Why give in now? Why bring a butter knife to a gunfight?!\"\n\nOn Sunday, Fetterman and nine other Democrats teamed with Republicans on a deal, despite the rest of the Democratic party remaining steadfast against it until Republicans agreed not to strip ACA subsidies from millions of people. Instead, Republicans simply promised to vote on the health care issue, but did not set a date for that vote, or promise that the subsidies would actually remain intact.\n\n\"Are you willing to gamble that the GOP will negotiate on health care in good faith once the government reopens?\" Hostin pressed. \"Because if that gamble is wrong, half a million Pennsylvanians, that you represent, their health care costs will skyrocket if you are wrong! And I believe you are wrong!\"\n\nFor his part, Fetterman maintained his calm and immediately dismissed the idea of ever taking any cues from Marjorie Taylor Greene.\n\n\"If Democrats are celebrating Crazy Pants like that, then that's on them,\" he said. \"And I don't need a lecture from, whether it's Bernie or the governor in California, because they are representing very deep blue kinds of populations. And a lot of those things were part of the extreme.\"\n\nFetterman argued against leaning extremely to one side, considering purple states like his.",

        "title": "Washington Post editorial praises Senate Democrats who voted to end shutdown, calls failure 'inevitable'",
        "description": "Late-night comedians Seth Meyers, Jon Stewart, Jimmy Kimmel and Stephen Colbert dug into the Democratic Party on Monday, after eight senators voted with the GOP on a deal to end the government shutdown.\n\nThe Washington Post editorial board praised the eight Senate Democrats who broke their party leaders to vote in favor of a House-passed continuing resolution (CR) Sunday night, arguing that \"the party that takes the government hostage to advance its policy goals almost never succeeds.\"\n\nComparing the ongoing government shutdown to when conservatives shut down the government in 2013 in an unsuccessful attempt to defund Obamacare, The Post contended that Democrats have followed suit and allowed \"angry activists\" to influence them into doing something that they knew wouldn't end well.\n\n\"The exact same thing just happened to Democrats, and it's ending the same way: with the same inevitable failure and predictable backlash from their own angry activists,\" the editorial board wrote.\n\nSENATE VOTE TO END GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN IGNITES DEMOCRAT CIVIL WAR\n\nAs the end nears for the longest government shutdown in U.S. history, The Post editorial said that many on the left have \"put on a performance of disappointment.\"\n\n\"Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont) called the bipartisan deal to reopen the government 'a policy and political disaster.' Rep. Greg Casar (D-Texas), chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, deemed it 'capitulation.' California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) described it as 'pathetic,'\" the outlet reported. \"They're mad that Democrats didn't get an extension of all covid-era Obamacare subsidies, but the public could do without such faux outrage.\"\n\nAccording to The Post, a perfunctory analysis of the history of government shutdowns in the U.S. shows that the party that \"takes the government hostage\" to advance its political aims, \"almost never succeeds.\" The editorial board referenced Republicans' failed attempt at defunding Obamacare in 2013 and President Donald Trump's unsuccessful attempt to secure funding for the border wall in 2019 as evidence.\n\n\"That's because even partial shutdowns eventually become too politically painful to maintain, as Democrats who watched airlines cancel thousands of flights over the past few days can attest. It's also because, for many politicians, the theater of obstructionism is more important than policy,\" The Post argued.\n\nRESURFACED OBAMA VIDEO BLASTING SHUTDOWN 'BLACKMAIL' NOW HAUNTS DEMOCRATS AMID NEW STANDOFF\n\nLater in the editorial, The Post asserted that the \"senators who broke ranks with the Democratic caucus on Sunday deserve credit,\" and that three senators in particular \"deserve even more\" for voting against the shutdown for longer.\n\n\"They include Dick Durbin (Illinois), Maggie Hassan (New Hampshire), Tim Kaine (Virginia), Jeanne Shaheen (New Hampshire) and Jacky Rosen (Nevada). Three senators who have been voting against the shutdown for longer deserve even more: Catherine Cortez Masto (Nevada), John Fetterman (Pennsylvania) and independent Angus King (Maine), who caucuses with Democrats,\" the editorial board wrote. \"These eight are taking heat from their party's progressive wing so that their colleagues don't have to. Notably, none of them are up for reelection next year.\"\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., drew criticism from the editorial board for not voting to reopen the government and instead letting other members of the party \"face the wrath of the party's base\" after voting with Republicans. The Post noted that a \"deal like this could not happen without the minority leader's tacit support.\"\n\n\"Yet Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-New York) voted against reopening the government. The price of being in leadership is taking tough votes, but Schumer -- petrified of a 2028 primary challenge -- left other members to face the wrath of the party's base,\" the editorial board contended.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE\n\nThe Post editorial slammed \"liberals who want to prolong the government shutdown\" for refusing to acknowledge \"the unnecessary pain they have already caused,\" and questioned whether another shutdown is imminent after the current deal expires at the end of this year.\n\n\"Many Democrats, especially in the House, will vote no on reopening the government while privately hoping it happens as soon as possible. But this is only a temporary patch. The deal extends current levels of government funding until Jan. 30. Will members learn their lesson? Or will this happen again in 80 days?\" The Post concluded.\n\nThe House bill funds military construction, the Department of Agriculture and the legislative branch through Sept. 30, 2026, and the rest of the government through Jan. 30. The final tally for the Senate vote was 60-40, the minimum threshold for passing such a bill.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nFox News Digital has reached out to Schumer's office for comment.\n\nFox News' Anders Hagstrom contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Trump administration skips COP30 climate summit, leaving California's Newsom to hurl criticism from Brazil",
        "description": "Ramy Inocencio is a CBS News foreign correspondent based in London, covering Europe and the Middle East. He joined the Network in 2019 as CBS News' Asia correspondent, based in Beijing and reporting across the Asia-Pacific, bringing two decades of experience working and traveling between Asia and the United States.\n\nIn Bel\u00e9m, the bustling Brazilian gateway to the Amazon rainforest, leaders from nearly 200 nations have gathered for the United Nations' 30th Climate Change Conference, known as COP30, to chart difficult next steps in the global fight against climate change. But the absence of the leaders from the world's three largest greenhouse gas emitters -- China, the United States and India -- cast a shadow over the summit as it kicked off.\n\nBeijing and New Delhi did dispatch senior-level delegations for the two-week summit. The White House, however, said no high-level U.S. officials would attend this year's COP. President Trump has repeatedly dismissed human-caused climate change as \"a hoax.\"\n\nTwo Democratic governors, California's Gavin Newsom and New Mexico's Michelle Lujan Grisham, were in Brazil to attend the summit, representing state-level U.S. efforts to curb emissions.\n\n\"What the hell is going on here?\" Newsom asked at a global investors' summit in S\u00e3o Paulo on Monday, where he fired off a characteristic criticism of the Trump administration. \"We're in Brazil -- one of our great trading partners, one of the world's great democracies. Home to all the rare earth metals we need. This is the country we should be engaging with, not slapping with 50% tariffs.\"\n\nTen years ago, 195 nations taking part in the COP21 summit signed onto the landmark Paris Agreement, intended to commit individual nations to take measures that, collectively, would limit the rise in average global temperatures to \"well below\" 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit). The objective in the agreement, which the Obama administration signed, was to pursue efforts to cap the global temperature increase at 1.5\u00b0C (2.7\u00b0F) above pre-industrial levels.\n\nThat target now appears out of reach.\n\nBased on national plans submitted this year, the planet is on course to warm by roughly 2.5\u00b0C (4.5\u00b0F) during this century. The Earth's average surface temperature in 2024 was the hottest since record keeping began in 1880 -- and the last 10 years have all ranked among the warmest ever observed.\n\nStill, U.N. Climate Change Executive Secretary Simon Stiell told delegates in Brazil this week that after three decades of dedicated talks, \"we are now bending the curve of planet heating emissions downwards -- for the very first time.\"\n\n\"I am not sugarcoating it,\" Stiell hastened to add. \"We have so much more work to do.\"\n\nA new U.N. analysis released this week shows that, if current national commitments are met, global emissions should fall by about 12% by 2035 compared to 2019 levels. That's an improvement from last month's projection of 10%, but still far short of the 60% reduction scientists say would be needed to keep warming within the Paris Agreement's 1.5\u00b0C goal.\n\nU.N. Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres has been pressing for stronger action, warning that surpassing the 1.5\u00b0C limit now looks almost inevitable and slamming it as both a \"moral failure\" and \"deadly negligence\" putting the lives of billions of people at risk.\n\nDespite low expectations for any sweeping breakthroughs, the delegations at COP30 are broadly expected to update national commitments to curb emissions in the next decade.\n\nA Brazil-led initiative to raise $125 billion for rainforest protection, coupled with renewed scrutiny of fossil fuel companies -- which Guterres accused of \"holding back change\" while collecting record profits and government subsidies -- were also expected to come out of the two-week gathering.\n\nThere is also likely to be more pressure applied on the governments of wealthy nations to help finance climate adaptations around the world, to help developing countries mitigate the impacts of a warming planet.\n\nAt last year's COP29 in Baku, Azerbaijan, countries agreed on an aspirational goal of mobilizing $1.3 trillion annually by 2035, with at least $300 billion expected to come from developing economies.\n\nPublicly available data on how much climate finance has actually been delivered since then, however, remains scarce, and that could be a key point of contention for the negotiators gathered in Bel\u00e9m to discuss.",

REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque\n\nAlthough President Donald Trump is confident in his redistricting battle designed to keep the Republican House majority, insiders say Republicans are fretting that last Tuesday's election results gave Democrats an opening to counterstrike, NBC reports.\n\nWhile one anonymous Republican strategist tells NBC that \"The president understands intuitively, in a way that other Republicans don't ... that Democrats are always assaulting us, always, and mostly much of the Republican Party never fights back.\"\n\n\"The redistricting fight is proof that they are not that way. So this is in his DNA in a way that is not in other Republicans' DNA,\" the strategist added.\n\nTwo other strategists described as close to the White House say they don't necessarily agree, telling NBC \"there are growing concerns in the party that the political war is not going as planned -- that the juice may not have been worth the squeeze and could, in a nightmare scenario, result in a net gain for Democrats.\"\n\n\"Misgivings\" about Trump's strategy heightened after California voters overwhelmingly approved Governor Gavin Newsom's Prop. 50 plan to redraw the state's congressional districts in a manner that Democrats hope will flip five House seats in their direction.\n\n\"For a few weeks now, he's had the understanding that they were going to lose Prop 50,\" a Republican operative close to the White House tells NBC, adding that Trump \"has been planning to sue California over the ballot measure while believing it was a bad idea to get involved in the fight.\"\n\n\"The stakes couldn't be higher,\" NBC explains, noting that Trump's legislative agenda will be \"imperiled by a Democratic takeover of the House,\" and \"also his administration would surely face myriad investigations and he could be impeached for a third time.\"\n\n\"With a narrow majority heading into a midterm, they need more seats for a buffer in order to hold the House. If they can ultimately net five or six seats, then it will be the story of the midterms of success for Republicans,\" a GOP strategist tells NBC. \"If the whole thing here was to net one seat across the country, then it will not have been worth it.\"\n\nIn the wake of \"strong Democratic showings in predominantly Hispanic areas of Virginia and New Jersey,\" Erin Covey, a nonpartisan election analyst who is the House editor at The Cook Political Report with Amy Walter, says there's \"uncertainty\" as to whether Hispanic voters will show up for the GOP next year like they did for Trump in 2024, particularly in states like Texas.\n\n\"That does not bode well for Republicans banking on Hispanic voters to help them keep their majority next year -- but it doesn't necessarily mean we'll see Republican incumbents who would be in safe seats suddenly look vulnerable all of a sudden,\" she said.\n\nAnother anonymous Republican with close ties to the president agrees and is raising the red flags, especially on Texas.\n\n\"I think 'concern' is a fair way to say it,\" they tell NBC.\n\nGOP consultant and data scientist John Eakin puts it more bluntly,\n\n\"Nobody wants to go against Trump in this district map because they fear him. They've pushed the envelope and it's going to come back to bite them in the ass,\" he said. \"They're high as a f -- -- kite off of 2024.\"",

        "description": "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.\n\nIn a blow to Republicans, a Utah district judge rejected a congressional district map drawn up by the state's GOP-dominated legislature and instead approved an alternate that will create a Democratic-leaning district ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.\n\nRepublicans currently control all four of the red state's congressional districts, but Utah District Judge Dianna Gibson ruled late Monday that a map drawn up by GOP lawmakers \"unduly favors Republicans and disfavors Democrats.\"\n\nUtah is the latest battlefield in the high-stakes redistricting showdown between President Donald Trump and Republicans versus Democrats to shape the midterm landscape in the fight for the House majority.\n\nThe faceoff over redistricting in Utah, a state Trump carried by nearly 22 percentage points in last year's presidential election, was triggered by a lawsuit by the League of Women Voters of Utah and Mormon Women for Ethical Government, which prompted Gibson to throw out the state's current congressional map.\n\nNEWSOM TAKES VICTORY LAP AFTER LANDSLIDE REDISTRICTING VICTORY IN CALIFORNIA\n\nGibson's move required state lawmakers to draw a new map, which the legislature approved last month.\n\nThe judge had ordered lawmakers to draw a map in compliance with a 2018 ballot measure approved by Utah voters that reformed redistricting standards, in order to prevent the drawing of districts to favor a political party, which is a practice known as gerrymandering.\n\nGibson rejected the Republican lawmakers' map and instead ruled in favor of one of two presented by the plaintiffs. It keeps nearly all of heavily populated Salt Lake County in one congressional district. The current congressional map divides the Democratic-dominated county among all four of the state's districts.\n\nThe judge had said she would rule by Monday, which was the day Utah Lt. Gov. Deidre Henderson said any new congressional map must be in place to be used in next year's elections.\n\nDemocrats have not controlled a congressional seat in Utah since the current map went into effect at the beginning of the decade.\n\n\"The DNC applauds the decision to choose a fair, impartial map that reflects the diversity and ideological makeup of the state. Utah Republicans gerrymandered the maps because they knew they were losing power in the state. Republicans doubled down when they chose to submit another gerrymandered map, but today, they were once again thwarted by impartial Courts,\" Democratic National Committee (DNC) Chair Ken Martin argued in a statement.\n\nAnd Martin vowed that \"Democrats will continue to fight for fair maps in Utah, regardless of what Donald Trump and Utah Republicans try next.\"\n\nTRUMP-BACKED REDISTRICTING PUSH TURNS MIDWESTERN STATE INTO NEXT POLITICAL BATTLEGROUND\n\nRepublicans, who have argued that Gibson does not have legal authority to enact a map not approved by the legislature, criticized the ruling.\n\n\"Judge Gibson has once again exceeded the constitutional authority granted to Utah's judiciary. After stretching the law to justify taking control of redistricting, she has now rejected Map C -- the only option that respected the Legislature's constitutional role -- and imposed a map of activists who are not accountable to Utahns,\" Utah Republican Party chair Robert Axson argued.\n\nAnd Axson charged, \"This is not interpretation. It is the arrogance of a judge playing King from the bench.\"\n\nThe ruling in Utah comes six days after California voters overwhelmingly passed Proposition 50, a ballot initiative which will temporarily sidetrack the left-leaning state's nonpartisan redistricting commission and return the power to draw the congressional maps to the Democrat-dominated legislature.\n\nThat is expected to result in five more Democratic-leaning congressional districts in California, which would counter the passage earlier this year in the reliable red state of Texas of a new map that aims to create up to five right-leaning House seats.\n\n\"California stepped up. Now, we are taking this fight across the country -- helping Democrats in other states push back against Trump's election rigging,\" California Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a statement to Fox News Digital last week, as he pointed to the push by Trump and Republicans for rare mid-decade redistricting.\n\nIt's part of a broad effort by Trump's political team and the GOP to pad the party's razor-thin House majority to keep control of the chamber in the 2026 midterms, when the party in power traditionally faces political headwinds and loses seats. Missouri, North Carolina, and Ohio have drawn new maps as part of the president's push.\n\nCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nTrump is aiming to prevent what happened during his first term in the White House when Democrats reclaimed the House majority in the 2018 midterm elections.\n\nIllinois and Maryland, two blue states, and Virginia, where Democrats control the legislature, are moving towards redistricting or are seriously considering, as are the red states of Indiana, Kansas, and Florida.",

        "description": "Lawmakers agree to end longest-ever government shutdown, reopen government through Jan 30\n\nThe U.S. Senate finally passed a funding package Nov. 10 to end the longest government shutdown in recorded history \u2012 42 days so far - at least through Jan. 30.\n\nThe jig is finally up for Senate Democrats, and the optics do not look good for them.\n\nCome next November, Democratic voters should remember that the government was closed for a record amount of time and that almost the entire Democratic caucus seems willing to keep the government closed indefinitely for leverage they didn't even really have.\n\nOverall, the deal makes Republicans look good: It would reopen the government and, in exchange, agreed to restore back pay for furloughed federal workers. Funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program would continue through next September, and Congress would resume funding other domestic agencies and programs. The deal also would reverse the firings of the more than 4,000 federal staffers laid off after the shutdown started Oct. 1.\n\nThe shutdown deal isn't done yet, though. Final votes are still needed in the House of Representatives.\n\nShutdown was a fool's errand by Democrats in Congress\n\nThe government shutdown was starting to affect people in real life. According to YouGov, about 36% of Americans say the federal government shutdown is affecting them either a great deal or somewhat. That's up from 21% in October.\n\nThis didn't have to happen in the first place. It was a colossal waste of time and effort on the part of the Democratic Party.\n\nPlus, it created a political civil war among progressives within the Democratic Party and forced their true colors to come through. From what I've seen already, it isn't pretty: Some Democrats are calling for the resignation of Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York, because they're so mad he didn't keep in line the rebellious few who caved.\n\nNow that the government will likely reopen soon, the shutdown antics originated by congressional Democrats have become crystal clear: They leveraged something they couldn't guarantee to lose an optics war they started and ultimately gained nothing but delayed wages, flights and SNAP benefits for millions of Americans.\n\nMost Democrats refused, using their desire to extend Affordable Care Act subsidies put in place during the COVID-19 pandemic as leverage.\n\nI'm glad Republicans didn't budge on Obamacare subsidies. Democrats voted for the American Rescue Plan Act and the Inflation Reduction Act, which increased the ACA subsidies temporarily.\n\nNo Republicans voted for either of those measures. Why would they have started now?\n\nIt was a fool's errand for Democrats to use Obamacare subsidies, of all things, as leverage, when Republicans have the majority and never voted for them in the first place.\n\nIn Congress, Republicans learned a lesson in unity - Democrats turned on one another\n\nI'm glad Republicans didn't cave on Democrats' pressure, even in spite of potentially sour optics. The shutdown fiasco is a lesson for Republicans in unity, something they've struggled with in the past.\n\nCircling the wagons to gain power or policy wins is usually something Democrats are better at doing. Watching Democrats turn on one another, when they failed to use Obamacare subsidies as leverage to keep the government closed, is icing on the cake.\n\nRepublicans have had 53 senators and essentially three Democrats \u2012 Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada, John Fetterman of Pennsylvania and Angus King of Maine \u2012 willing to reopen the government, so they only needed four more Democrats to push legislation to the floor. Five Democrats surrendered.\n\nSome congressional Democrats are furious at their eight colleagues. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-New York, said in a post on X that they failed to \"hold the line.\"\n\nIn September, House Republicans passed a spending bill, but it failed in the Senate because Democrats decided they wanted to extend tax credits for Americans enrolled in the Affordable Care Act. Republicans argued that Obamacare subsidies could be debated later, but Democrats wouldn't budge. Republicans ultimately voted not once, not twice, but more than a dozen times to keep the government open and fund SNAP benefits, military pay and more.\n\nOther Democrats are furious, too. Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker said the GOP's deal was \"an empty promise,\" and California Gov. Gavin Newsom seemed to call the move \"pathetic\" in a post on X, though he didn't specify more.\n\nWhen midterm elections arrive in 2026, voters would do well to remember that under the guise of health care affordability, it was Democratic politicians who refused to agree on a measure to reopen the federal government - and scorned the members of their party who did - all for leverage on a policy demand they ultimately lost anyway.\n\nNicole Russell is a columnist at USA TODAY and a mother of four who lives in Texas.

        "title": "Cities across U.S. fail to curb traffic deaths: \"They don't return home\"",
        "description": "Los Angeles -- Kris Edwards waited at home with friends for his wife, Erika \"Tilly\" Edwards, to go out to dinner, but she never made it back to the house they had purchased only four days earlier. Around 9 p.m. on June 29, a hit-and-run driver killed Tilly as she walked to her car after a fundraiser performance in Hollywood.\n\n\"I've just got to figure out how to keep living. And the hard part with that is not knowing why,\" Edwards said of his wife's death.\n\nDespite local, state, and federal safety campaigns, such as the global Vision Zero initiative to eliminate traffic fatalities, such deaths are up 20% in the U.S. from a decade ago, from 32,744 in 2014 to an estimated 39,345 in 2024, according to data from the Department of Transportation's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Although traffic deaths have declined since peaking at 43,230 in 2021, the number of deaths remains higher than a decade ago.\n\nSince the COVID-19 pandemic, the Pew Research Center found, Americans' driving habits have worsened across multiple measures, from reckless driving to drunk driving, which road safety advocates call a public health failure. They say technology could dramatically reduce traffic deaths, but proposals often run up against industry resistance, and the Trump administration is focusing on driverless cars to both innovate and improve public safety.\n\n\"Every day, 20 people go out for a walk, and they don't return home,\" said Adam Snider, a spokesperson for the Governors Highway Safety Association, which represents state road safety offices.\n\nAmerican roads have become more dangerous than violent crimes in some cities: Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Houston are among the major cities that now report more traffic fatalities than homicides. In 2024, the Los Angeles Police Department reported an estimated 268 homicides and 302 traffic deaths, the second consecutive year that the number of people killed in collisions exceeded the number of homicide victims, according to Crosstown LA, a nonprofit community news outlet.\n\nSan Francisco reported 42 traffic deaths and 35 homicides in 2024. In Houston, approximately 345 people died in crashes and 322 from homicide.\n\n\"Simply put, the United States is in the middle of a road safety emergency,\" David Harkey, president of the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, testified during a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee hearing this summer. Harkey said that, out of 29 high-income countries, America ranks at the bottom in road safety. \"This spike is not -- I repeat, is not -- a global trend. The U.S. is an outlier.\"\n\nIn January 2017, then-Mayor Eric Garcetti joined 13 other L.A. city leaders in pledging to implement the Vision Zero action plan and eliminate traffic deaths in the city by 2025.\n\nInstead, deaths have increased.\n\nAn audit released in April that was commissioned by the city's administrative officer found that the level of enthusiasm for the program at City Hall has diminished and that it suffered because of \"the pandemic, conflicts of personality, lack of total buy-in for implementation, disagreements over how the program should be administered, and scaling issues.\" The report also cited competing interests among city departments and inconsistent investment in the city's most dangerous traffic corridors.\n\nMayor Karen Bass' office did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nLast year, California state Sen. Scott Wiener proposed a bill that would have required new cars sold in the state to include \"intelligent speed assistance,\" software that could prevent vehicles from exceeding the speed limit by more than 10 mph. But the bill was watered down following pushback from the auto industry and opposition from some legislators who called it government overreach. It was ultimately vetoed by Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, who said a state mandate would disrupt ongoing federal safety assessments.\n\nMeanwhile, the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, an influential automotive lobby, this year sued the federal government over an automatic emergency braking rule adopted during the Biden administration. The lawsuit is pending in federal court while the Department of Transportation completes a review. Even before Donald Trump was sworn in for his second term, the alliance appealed to the president-elect in a letter to support consumer choice.\n\nUnder President Trump, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy is prioritizing the development of autonomous vehicles by proposing sweeping regulatory changes to test and deploy driverless cars. \"Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards were written for vehicles with human drivers and need to be updated for autonomous vehicles,\" NHTSA Chief Counsel Peter Simshauser said in September in announcing the modernization effort, which includes repealing some safety rules. \"Removing these requirements will reduce costs and enhance safety.\"\n\nSome Democratic lawmakers, however, have criticized the administration's repeal of safety rules as misguided since new rules can be implemented without undoing existing safeguards. NHTSA officials did not respond to requests for comment about Democrats' concerns.\n\nAdvocates worry that without continued adoption of road safety regulations for conventional vehicles, factors such as excessive speed and human error will continue to drive fatalities despite the push for driverless cars.\n\n\"We need to continue to have strong collaboration from the federal, state, local sectors, public sector, private sector, the everyday public,\" Snider, of the Governors Highway Safety Association, said. \"We need everyday drivers to get involved.\"\n\nIt took nearly a month for police to track down the driver of a Mercedes-Benz G-Wagen allegedly involved in Tilly's death. Authorities have charged Davontay Robins with vehicular manslaughter with gross negligence, felony hit-and-run driving, and driving with a suspended license due to a previous DUI. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges and is out on bail.\n\nKris Edwards now tends to the couple's backyard garden by himself. Since his wife's death, he has experienced sleep deprivation, fatigue, and trouble eating, and he relies on a cane to walk. His doctors attribute his ailments to the brain's response to grief.\n\n\"I'm not alone,\" he said. \"But I am lonely, in this big, empty house without my partner.\"\n\nEdwards hopes for justice for his wife, though he said he's unsure if prosecutors will get a conviction. He wants her death to mean something: safer streets, slower driving, and for pedestrians to be cautious when getting in and out of cars parked on busy streets.\n\n\"I want my wife's death to be a warning to others who get too comfortable and let their guard down even for a moment,\" he said. \"That moment is all it takes.\"\n\nKFF Health News is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at KFF -- the independent source for health policy research, polling, and journalism.",

        "title": "Senate approves deal to end longest-ever shutdown; House vote next. Live updates",
        "description": "WASHINGTON \u2012 The Senate approved a deal Monday night to end the nation's longest-ever government shutdown, putting Congress on the brink of resolving a weeks-long fight that has disrupted flights and halted food stamps for millions of Americans.\n\nIn a 60-40 vote, the Senate signed off on a deal reached by eight members of the Democratic Senate Caucus and Republicans to reopen the government through Jan. 30. The continuing resolution now heads to the House of Representatives, which is expected to take it up on Wednesday following the Veteran's Day holiday.\n\nThe bill is expected to have enough votes in the Republican-controlled House for passage, even though most Democrats are likely to vote against it.\n\nThe government shutdown has stretched 42 days. In a concession to Democrats, the continuing resolution would reverse President Donald Trump's recent layoffs of federal workers amid the shutdown \u2012 but it would not extend expiring Affordable Care Act subsidies as Democrats had demanded for weeks.\n\nInstead, the bill only guarantees a stand-alone vote on the health care subsidies in December before the credits expire at the end of the year and send health care premiums skyrocketing. It's unclear enough Republicans support extending the ACA subsidies for the measure to pass in the Senate, and Speaker Mike Johnson has not committed to holding a vote in the House.\n\nThe eight Democratic defectors in the Senate are facing widespread criticism from within their party for caving to Trump's shutdown threats. And Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, despite voting against the deal, is hearing calls to step down from leadership for not keeping his caucus in line.\n\nTrump says he supports Senate deal to reopen government\n\nTrump said on Monday he supports the Senate deal to reopen the government brokered between Republican leaders and eight Democratic lawmakers.\n\n\"Based on everything I'm hearing, they haven't changed anything,\" Trump told reporters Monday in the Oval Office. \"And we have support from enough Democrats, and we're going to be reopening our country.\"\n\n\"It's too bad it was closed, but we'll be reopening our country very quickly,\" Trump said.\n\nThe agreement, which would require Trump's signature to become law, would reverse Trump's recent firing of federal workers during the shutdown, but the president suggested he's fine with that.\n\n\"I'll abide by the deal. The deal is very good,\" Trump said.\n\nWhat's in the deal?\n\nThe deal that advanced in the Senate would reopen the government until Jan. 30 and cover full-year funding for several agencies and programs, including food aid and veterans' benefits. SNAP funding would continue through September at higher levels.\n\nIt also includes a commitment to vote on a bill to potentially extend expiring Obamacare subsidies. The tax credits, which millions of Americans rely on for help paying premiums, have been the issue at the center of the shutdown fight.\n\nIn addition, the deal will reverse the layoffs of thousands of federal workers, while barring any potential firings until Jan. 30. The terminations have been temporarily blocked by a federal court.\n\nTrump pledges $10,000 bonuses for air traffic controllers who worked during shutdown\n\nTrump on Monday pledged to provide $10,000 bonuses to air traffic controllers who worked while being unpaid during the shutdown and threatened to dock the pay of those who haven't reported to work.\n\n\"All Air Traffic Controllers must get back to work, NOW!!!\" Trump said on social media Nov. 10. \"Anyone who doesn't will be substantially 'docked.'\"\n\nMany air traffic controllers continued working without a paycheck during the shutdown. But others refused and didn't report to airports across the country, prompting the Federal Aviation Administration to order airlines to cancel 4% of their flights over the weekend.\n\nTrump told Fox News on Monday night he's not sure where he will get the funding for the bonuses. \"I don't know. I'll get it from some place. I always get the money from some place.\"\n\nDemocrats fume over colleagues giving in\n\nA handful of Senate Democrats have backed the compromise to reopen the government, but it didn't make them popular among their fellow leaders on the left.\n\n\"Making this deal is malpractice,\" New Jersey Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill said in a statement.\n\n\"Pathetic,\" California Gov. Gavin Newsom wrote in a one-word post on X.\n\nAnd most Senate Democrats balked at the compromise.\n\n\"I cannot support a deal that still leaves millions of Americans wondering how they are going to pay for their health care or whether they will be able to afford to get sick,\" said Sen. Mark Warner, D-Virginia.",

        "description": "A communist will soon be taking over the top executive spot for the nation's most iconic city -- and not just any communist, but a radical Muslim communist with open antisemitic leanings -- and not just any city, but the city that was torn apart by the toppling of its Twin Towers on Sept. 11, 2001. And in Virginia, in New Jersey, it's more of the same -- Democrats, which is to really say socialists, which is to really say communists, won the top gubernatorial spots.\n\nMeanwhile, Proposition 50 passed in California, giving Democrats a better-than-your-average-bear chance of redrawing districts in a way that strips Republicans of the teeny, weeny, tiny five-seat congressional power they have managed to hold in the Golden State. 'Cause nothing says tolerance like a total, top-down control of the electoral process. Right, Gov. Gavin Newsom?\n\nA quick-hit look at the wake of the election results might suggest Democrats have the winning message and that voters are tired of the MAGA movement, and as such, Americans pulled the poll levers for the left. But this isn't exactly what occurred.\n\nReally, the fact that Democrats -- that is to say, socialists, and that is really actually, truly, more to truth say, communists -- have any wins at all is due to three causes: 1) the flood of illegal immigrants; 2) the dumbing of America's youth; and 3) the media.\n\nOn the first: Democrats have gleefully opened borders for years, nay, decades, as a means of ushering in the next batch of faithful followers, err, sheep, who will, by their presence, tilt Census Bureau census findings to apportion more representatives in left-leaning states. If they can vote illegally in elections along the way to the next census count, all the better, say Democrats.\n\nOn the second: Today's youth have been steadily taught to dislike America, detest capitalism, distance themselves from God and to blame America for all the world's ills; fault America's founders for giving us a racist Constitution; and slam America's conservative politicians as discriminatory and unjust for insisting on a government that stays limited in scope, i.e., that doesn't use tax dollars to provide for the people, cradle to grave. The public schools have taught this for decades. The colleges and universities have harped on this for decades. What's resulted is a class of Americans who see nothing wrong with voting for a communist -- who in fact characterize communists as good American patriots.\n\nOn the third: It's the media, stupid. This is where the true evil genius of the evil ones of the left shines. For far too long, members of the media have skated accountability for errors, all the while skirting long-held standards of serving as the truth-bearers for the American people. They've only watchdogged when watchdogging can take down a MAGA. They've only tried to dig at truths when it involves an accusation slung a Republican's way. Hunter Biden and the laptop? Ignore. Censor. Donald Trump and collusion with Russia? Build up and boy, oh, boy, don't let it drift from the public consciousness. Use a pee tape if you must -- find some prostitutes if you can -- but whatever the deal, whatever the dirt, dig and dig and dig and don't stop digging. It's that old adage, repeat a lie often enough and it becomes truth.\n\nBBC's top executives just learned a lesson about lying to the public when two of them, the director-general, Tim Davie, and the CEO of news, Deborah Turness, resigned in disgrace after they were outed for allowing into an aired documentary some creative edits that seemed to show President Trump telling supporters to violently storm the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nHere's the thing, though.\n\nThey were only feeling the disgrace because they were caught in their lie.\n\nThey weren't feeling the disgrace because of their actual despicable lie.\n\nAnd this is how the media have operated for a very long time: Lie, lie until the lies become truths, and if any lies are actually outed as lies -- well then, roll whatever heads necessary to smooth things over and move on to the next lie.\n\nIf it weren't for the lies of the media, Zohran Mamdani's win as New York City mayor wouldn't have happened because members of the media would have told the truths about communism and anti-semitism and his ties to radical Islamic clerics. If it weren't for the lies of the media, Democrats wouldn't have swept through Virginia and taken New Jersey and won on Proposition 50 because voters would have been aware of how damaging -- how radical -- how anti-America all these candidates and proposals and ideas of the left are to the country. Voters, if voters were properly enlightened by a truthful press, would never vote Democrat, that is to really say, socialist, that is really to say, communist, again.\n\nIt's the media, stupid.\n\nIt's the propaganda passed off as news, combined with the dumbing down of the voting class.\n\nWithout their coddling, fawning friends in the media, Democrats would disappear from political power.",

        "description": "Sacramento County Sheriff Jim Cooper tells Fox News Digital the state's diversion law is being abused by violent and repeat offenders, erasing accountability and putting public safety at risk.\n\nA California law meant to help people with mental illness avoid prison is now letting violent criminals and repeat offenders walk free, Sacramento County Sheriff Jim Cooper warned, calling it a \"terrible\" policy that's being \"abused\" by \"career criminals.\"\n\nCooper told Fox News Digital that \"terrible laws\" have replaced accountability with \"excuses.\"\n\n\"There's room for diversion somewhere, especially someone that has an addiction problem,\" Cooper explained. \"But what's happened is they open the gates wide. So right now everyone's taking advantage of it. A lot of criminals are. They're really abusing the system, and that's the unfortunate part about it.\"\n\nIn a post shared last week on the department's official Facebook page, Cooper criticized state diversion policies, writing that \"career criminals [are] using mental health as a shield to avoid consequences.\"\n\nBLUE CITY DA SAYS REPEAT DRUG OFFENDERS 'WILL NOT RESPECT THE LAW' UNDER CURRENT SYSTEM\n\nCalifornia's mental health diversion law, passed in 2018 under AB 1810 and SB 215, gives defendants the ability to pause their criminal cases and enter a court-approved treatment program instead of going to jail.\n\nIf they complete treatment successfully, their charges are dismissed and their record is wiped clean, Cooper explained.\n\nThe law was designed to help people whose mental illness contributed to their crimes get treatment rather than punishment.\n\nBut it goes much further than many realize.\n\nOnly a few crimes are excluded - murder, voluntary manslaughter, rape and sex crimes requiring registration. Everything else, from child abuse to armed robbery, can qualify for diversion.\n\nEven the list of mental health conditions that count toward eligibility is broad.\n\nAccording to the state's own guidelines, nearly any diagnosis listed in the DSM-5, the manual doctors used to define mental disorders, can qualify.\n\nNEWSOM JUST MADE A CATASTROPHIC MISTAKE ON CALIFORNIA'S HOMELESSNESS DISASTER\n\nThe only exceptions are borderline personality disorder, antisocial personality disorder and pedophilia.\n\nLawmakers have tried to tighten those rules.\n\nAssembly Bill 433, introduced by Assemblymember Maggy Krell, would prevent defendants charged with child abuse, endangerment or serious injury crimes from being diverted.\n\nCooper's office called it \"a big step in the right direction, but much is left to be done.\"\n\nCooper said some of the most shocking crimes he's seen in decades are now being swept into California's mental health diversion system, including cases where babies were tortured or killed, and the suspects still qualified for diversion instead of prison.\n\n\"If you beat your kid to death, you should not be around kids,\" Cooper said. \"When he got diversion, it erased his record... He can be a teacher, a coach -- and that's scary.\"\n\nBLUE CITY ERUPTS AS 91-TIME FELON TRIES TO DODGE PRISON, WEASEL INTO REHAB AFTER CRASH\n\nAccording to the Sacramento County Sheriff's Office, recent cases include:\n\nCooper said those cases show how the law has gone far beyond its original intent, with the current system leaving judges with no flexibility.\n\n\"We've seen some horrific cases here in Sacramento and really across the state of California,\" he said. \"It ties the judges' hands... they don't have a choice to grant diversion.\"\n\nAccording to the Sheriff's Office, brothers Adam and Juan Velasquez, both known as Howe Park Sure\u00f1o gang members, were convicted of violently attacking an innocent man in an unprovoked assault. Deputies said the victim was blindsided, knocked unconscious and seriously injured simply because the suspects perceived him as a rival.\n\nSUPREME COURT SKEPTICAL OF 'CONVERSION THERAPY' LAW BANNING TREATMENT OF MINORS WITH GENDER IDENTITY ISSUES\n\nWhile both were arrested for felonies, officials noted that Juan Velasquez was granted mental health diversion instead of serving jail time.\n\nIn May, while out on probation, the brothers allegedly struck again. The sheriff's office said they confronted another man who was dining with his family at a restaurant, shouted gang slurs, tried to assault and stab the victim with a knife, and then slashed his tires before fleeing.\n\nThe victim again had no gang affiliation. Deputies arrested Adam Velasquez in August, and Juan Velasquez was located and arrested later by the sheriff's gang detectives.\n\n\"These bad guys know there is zero accountability... They talk about it in our jails. We've got them on record talking about mental health diversion -- how to exploit it and get out of their cases,\" Cooper said.\n\nIn another example cited by the Sheriff's Office, 44-year-old Darren Campoy was arrested this month by robbery detectives outside his Roseville home. Deputies said Campoy had robbed the Sacramento Credit Union on Oct. 15, 2025, handing a teller a note demanding cash and walking out with $2,460.\n\nAccording to the sheriff's post, Campoy was already on Post-Release Community Supervision (PRCS) from Placer County for a 2021 bank robbery. Earlier this year, he was granted mental health diversion, which Cooper said erased his criminal proceedings so that he could receive \"treatment\" instead of jail time.\n\n\"If they complete treatment successfully, their charges are dismissed,\" Cooper said, calling it a process that \"effectively erases the defendant's record.\"\n\nPARENTAL RIGHTS CONCERNS ERUPT OVER CALIFORNIA BILL THAT WOULD LET NON-RELATIVES MAKE DECISIONS FOR KIDS\n\nDespite a long criminal record, including armed robbery, reckless driving and evading police, and what psychologists reportedly described as a \"higher risk to public safety,\" Campoy was released. Less than a year later, deputies said, he robbed a bank again.\n\n\"Less than a year later, he's back to robbing banks. That's a result of terrible laws. And it's exactly what happens when accountability gets replaced with excuses,\" the sheriff's office wrote.\n\nCooper said the current system has created a revolving door that puts the public at risk.\n\n\"People need to be held accountable when they commit these types of crimes. Right now, anyone in jail, anyone and everyone are basically applying for mental health diversion and a lot of them are getting it because in the court system, it ties their hands,\" he continued.\n\nHe added that his deputies routinely see suspects discussing how to claim mental health conditions after the fact to qualify for leniency.\n\n\"It really makes it harder to do your job. And these bad guys know there is zero accountability that they can get away with these crimes, nothing's gonna happen.\"\n\nWhen reached for comment, a spokesperson for Gov. Gavin Newsom told Fox News Digital that the state's diversion policy is determined by the courts, not the governor.\n\n\"Under Penal Code section 1001.36, the decision to refer a defendant to mental health diversion is solely within a judge's discretion,\" the spokesperson said. \"The governor does not review individual cases and cannot determine whether repeat offenders should be admitted -- that is up to the judge hearing the case.\"\n\nThe spokesperson added that Newsom \"is committed to effective public safety,\" and said the purpose of the diversion law is to ensure that \"when people who commit crimes because of a mental health disorder receive necessary treatment, the public is safer.\"\n\n\"That is the heart of the mental health diversion statute,\" the spokesperson said, adding that the governor \"would take into consideration any bill that lands on his desk.\"\n\nNewsom's office also noted that several serious offenses are not eligible for diversion under state law, including murder, voluntary manslaughter, rape, child sexual abuse and crimes involving weapons of mass destruction or DUI offenses.\n\nThe sheriff said he plans to keep pushing for reform when the Legislature reconvenes next year.\n\n\"We'll be back in January and battle this bill that's pending to make diversion even more widespread,\" Cooper said.\n\nAnd until the law changes, Cooper said, his department will keep exposing the cases that highlight what he calls a \"broken system.\"\n\n\"We're gonna hold folks accountable as much as we can,\" he said. \"When it goes awry, we're gonna let you know about it and we're not going to sit on it.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nCalifornia's mental health diversion law (AB 1810) allows certain defendants to pause criminal proceedings and enter treatment instead of serving jail time, with charges dismissed upon successful completion. Lawmakers intended the policy to reduce incarceration among people whose mental illness contributed to their crimes.\n\n\"The idea behind diversion laws was to help those who commit low-level crimes because of treatable mental illness,\" the sheriff's office wrote. \"But what we have now are career criminals using 'mental health' as a shield to avoid consequences - and this is the result.\"",

        "title": "Opinion | California's woes are many. Will any Democrat dare admit it in 2026?",
        "description": "California Gov. Gavin Newsom speaks to reporters in Stockton, California, on Oct. 22. (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)\n\nBill Whalen, the Hoover Institution's Virginia Hobbs Carpenter Distinguished Policy Fellow in Journalism, was chief speechwriter to former California governor Pete Wilson.\n\nAs tempting as it may be to view the New Jersey and Virginia gubernatorial votes as Democratic temperature checks, a more telling thermometer may exist farther west: the race to succeed a term limited Gov. Gavin Newsom in California.\n\nThis may seem odd given that the Golden State is arguably the most azure of America's \"blue\" states. Apart from Arnold Schwarzenegger, no Republican has won a California gubernatorial contest in more than three decades. The average Democratic margin of victory in the four post-Arnold races? Almost 19 points.\n\nYet, California's 2026 contest bears watching for two reasons: an uncharacteristically wide-open primary lacking a governor-in-waiting, which wasn't the case the last two times there was no incumbent on the ballot, and a bevy of Democratic hopefuls engaged in a balancing act of appealing to an electorate that believes the Golden State is on the wrong track while not holding their party at least partially responsible for that sour mood. (Democrats currently occupy all of California's statewide constitutional offices and enjoy supermajority control of both legislative chambers.)\n\nAbout the California field: To the extent that there was a front-runner after former vice president Kamala Harris took herself out of the running, it was former congresswoman Katie Porter. But her lead always rested on the political quicksand of simple name recognition from having competed in last year's U.S. Senate primary. It remains to be seen what damage she has suffered from recent bad press regarding her temperament.\n\nWho, then, to fill the void? At least three other Democrats -- all with flaws -- could jump in.\n\nSen. Alex Padilla may decide he wants to relocate to Sacramento, but he has little to show in the way of accomplishments since replacing Kamala Harris in Washington four years ago. (One September gubernatorial poll shows 7 percent support for California's senior U.S. senator.)\n\nClimate investor Tom Steyer, who starred in self-financed and brutally anti-Trump ads in support of Proposition 50 and a mid-decade redrawing of California's congressional map, suddenly became front and center on voters' streaming devices. (Some local Democrats critiqued Steyer's late involvement as self-serving.) But his political record is notable for its futility: more than $150 million wasted on a failed presidential bid in 2020.\n\nAnd there's Rick Caruso, the Los Angeles developer and billionaire who, judging from his social media feed, can't decide whether he wants to be the state's next governor or his city's next mayor. That Caruso was an 11th-hour party convert when he ran for mayor in 2022 is something his primary rivals will probably reference.\n\nThe gubernatorial primary isn't until June 2, which gives Democratic hopefuls about seven months to lay out policy agendas. But there's a catch: To land Newsom's current day job, those hopefuls have to work around a Newsom flaw -- his overpromising when applying for the same position.\n\nSeven years ago, on the precipice of succeeding the more centrist Jerry Brown, Newsom vowed to steer California hard to port. In his words: \"Guaranteed health care for all. A 'Marshall Plan' for affordable housing. A master plan for aging with dignity. A middle-class workforce strategy. A cradle-to-college promise for the next generation. An all-hands approach to ending child poverty.\"\n\nWith a year left in office, Newsom hasn't made good on that ambitious agenda. California's child poverty rate nearly tripled from 2021 to 2024. The goal of building 2.5 million homes by 2030 (downgraded from 3.5 million) won't be reached at the current pace. After expanding Medi-Cal (the state's Medicaid program) to include all Californians regardless of legal status, the latest state budget scaled back health care for undocumented immigrants -- a shift that speaks to the Golden State's fiscal woes and perhaps the governor's presidential ambitions.\n\nDoes this mean that, now that California has voted on the Trump referendum that was Proposition 50 and attention should turn back to conditions on the ground, a Golden State Democratic candidate might dare to disparage the governor's record? It would be a calculated risk -- calculating how to survive California's \"open\" primary, where the top two vote-getters advance to the general election regardless of party affiliation.\n\nDesigned to encourage candidates to reach out to the middle with a more centrist appeal, the opposite occurred in 2018's open primary when Newsom, well ahead in the polls, spent money attacking conservative John Cox to elevate the Republican to second place. By doing so, Newsom avoided a more competitive runoff against former Los Angeles mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, who is once again a gubernatorial candidate.\n\nBut in a field currently lacking a Democrat with the same standing that Newsom enjoyed seven years ago -- as lieutenant governor, he ramped up for higher office by championing successful ballot measures on gun control and marijuana legalization -- no Democrat is likely to approach his 33.7 percent share of the primary vote (Democrats account for more than 61 percent of the primary vote). Instead, each hopeful would have to figure out how to appeal to a California electorate among whom nearly 45 percent of registered voters identify as Democrat and 22.5 percent as independent.\n\nWill Democrats campaign across California as Newsom did in 2018, offering a menu of unattainable progressive ideals? Will a viable Democratic candidate dare to say that their party has contributed to California's woes, including chronic homelessness, educational inequality and fiscal recklessness?\n\nPerhaps the latter is only so much California dreaming. Still, in the state that's home to the country's entertainment capital, it would be nice to see a plot twist.",

        "title": "Democrats face demand for ruthlessness as shutdown ends",
        "description": "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-New York) blasted the eight Democrats who voted with Senate Republicans to advance a bill that would end the government shutdown. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nThe fury at eight Democratic-aligned senators who voted with Republicans to end the longest-ever government shutdown highlights the dramatic shift in the Democratic Party less than a year into President Donald Trump's second term, as voters and lawmakers argue the party needs to adopt more ruthless tactics to counter the president and claw its way back to power.\n\nThe reaction to the two votes on Sunday and Monday, which provide a pathway for the government to reopen after more than 40 days, was fierce. Rep. Ro Khanna (D-California) called for Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer to be replaced, suggesting he was an ineffective leader even though Schumer opposed the government funding measure. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries blasted the eight senators and said House Democrats would not support a government funding bill that did not include the health care measures the party has demanded. Democratic advocacy groups, politically vulnerable lawmakers, potential 2028 presidential candidates and voters all followed suit, lambasting those in their party they saw as caving.\n\nThe desire for Democrats to hold firm despite the pain inflicted by the shutdown -- even though the party's prior posture was that shutdowns were self-destructive -- was the latest example of a party that has decided it must adopt an altogether different playbook given Trump's willingness to resort to unprecedented measures to consolidate and maintain power. Rather than try to uphold norms as Trump shatters them, they have instead decided to fight Trump with tactics they previously disdained -- and excoriated those who have stood in the way, whether on redistricting or standing by candidates with problematic pasts.\n\n\"Early on, there were not enough members of Congress who recognized the magnitude of the threat Donald Trump poses to our democracy and constitution,\" said Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Maryland), who opposed the government funding deal. \"That has changed.\"\n\nVan Hollen said there were a small number of senators in what he dubbed the \"no business as usual caucus\" at the beginning of Trump's term that has since grown dramatically in response to energy from the party's base.\n\n\"The lesson is there is power in unity and in members of Congress working in partnership with the grassroots community,\" he said. \"This is why so many people are feeling let down at this moment, because that unity was important.\"\n\nBeyond the shutdown, the party has also shifted course on redrawing congressional maps, retreating from past attempts to rely on independent commissions as Democrats fight a wave of Republican-led efforts to alter maps in conservative-led states. California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) led a successful campaign to redraw his state's map and won voter approval in a special election last week, prompting Democrats in states such as Virginia, Illinois and Maryland to consider similar efforts.\n\nOn Monday, while traveling to a conference in Brazil, Newsom chided Democrats in the Senate who broke ranks on the shutdown, arguing that they foolishly \"decided that we're playing by the old set of rules\" and had not adjusted to the new reality.\n\nThere have been other signs of Democrats' new posture. Once quick to demand their politicians step aside after scandal, Democrats have been standing by candidates who have had problematic past statements surface -- with some early success. Jay Jones, whose violent text messages from years ago were leaked just weeks before Election Day, overcame the controversy to become Virginia's next attorney general, an office he hopes to use as a bulwark against the Trump administration.\n\nSwing Left, a liberal group that was born out of Democratic anger at Trump's 2016 election, decided to invest considerable money and time into his campaign after the leaked texts -- in which he nonchalantly mused about shooting the former GOP speaker of the House of Delegates in the head -- emerged. The decision-making process was brief, said Yasmin Radjy, the group's executive director, even if Jones's comments were \"indefensible.\"\n\n\"We just can't play by the old playbook of receding to the background, even when candidates have the warts that candidates have. Winning power is about math, and we have to win majorities,\" said Radjy. \"We need to be more ruthlessly pragmatic than we ever have been, even when that's maybe uncomfortable.\"\n\nLikewise, Graham Platner, a liberal oysterman and veteran, has insisted he will still run for one of Maine's two Senate seats despite only recently altering a tattoo on his chest resembling a Nazi symbol and problematic Reddit posts from years ago in which he downplayed sexual assault in the military and described himself as a communist. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont) has maintained his support for Platner, arguing that there has been a growing opposition to \"cancel culture\" and a realization that people cannot be solely judged by comments or actions from years ago.\n\n\"Many Democrats understand now, after the presidential election, that simply defending the status quo is not good enough,\" Sanders said in an interview. \"The Democratic Party has been perceived to be weak, to not stand up and fight, so I think that is one of the changes that we are seeing.\"\n\nKelli Musick of Portland, Maine, said she was drawn to Platner as soon as she saw his campaign launch video because he came across as authentic and renewed her sense of hope. Weeks later, she was upset when she learned about his tattoo and his social media posts. After listening to his apologies and explanations, she determined he had taken responsibility for his mistakes and grown as a person, said Musick, 32, a caseworker with the state health department.\n\nMusick said she was outraged in 2017 by the sexual misconduct allegations that prompted Sen. Al Franken (D-Minnesota) to quit the Senate. But the political stakes of today are much higher, she said, noting Trump has flirted with running for a third term despite the constitutional limit.\n\n\"We're a far cry from the days of Dijon mustard and tan suits,\" she said, referring to episodes from Barack Obama's presidency in which he was mocked for his choice of condiment and attire. \"So I think, yes, certainly we are more willing to let things slide than previously.\"\n\nThis new posture is not only invigorating the party's base, but also candidates who are running to change the party from within. State Sen. Mallory McMorrow, who is running for Michigan's open Senate seat, said she can feel a \"renewed energy to reshape\" a Democratic Party that has, at times, allowed Republicans to play by a separate set of rules.\n\n\"There is too much nostalgia for the way that things were, and the only way to get back to the way that things were is to treat this moment very differently,\" McMorrow said. \"You have to fight fire with fire, you have to make sure that Democrats hold power to make the changes that are going to be necessary.\"\n\nNeera Tanden, the head of the liberal think tank Center for American Progress, said Trump's reelection marked an inflection point for the Democratic Party that made it \"hard to say that some things are just unacceptable in politics these days.\"\n\n\"That's a big shift from, 'When they go low, we go high.' And it's even a shift from 2020 because the ethos of President Biden was like, 'I'm going to restore the soul of the nation,'\" said Tanden, a former senior official under Biden. \"The real problem is that if only one side is following the norms of decorum, then the other side is basically benefiting from the weakness of Democrats.\"\n\nFormer first lady Michelle Obama, who originated the phrase \"when they go low, we go high\" during her speech to the Democratic National Convention in 2016, has even acknowledged that the dynamic has shifted.\n\n\"The true answer is, no,\" she said on the \"All The Smoke\" podcast in August when asked if \"we still have to go high.\"\n\n\"Going high is about being strategic, and that is really my point,\" Obama said.\n\nThere are few Democrats arguing the party should be abiding by previous rules and norms. But those who do are quickly assailed as out of touch and complicit in what some have characterized as Trump's slide into authoritarianism.\n\nIn Maryland, Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) has refused to advance any mid-cycle redistricting effort even as its Democratic governor, Wes Moore, insists Maryland will move ahead in drawing new maps. Ferguson has opposed the effort for a list of philosophical reasons and a core pragmatic one: he believes Maryland courts would ultimately overturn the map and potentially cost Democrats more seats than redistricting would gain.\n\nHe said the risk of losing power -- at the cost of compromising good-governance values -- will ultimately backfire, arguing Democrats need to consider what the party will stand for in the long term.\n\n\"To the degree that it is within the laws and constitutions of the state, yes, we should be thinking of different tactics to win,\" Ferguson said in an interview. \"Where I do not think we should go is the lawlessness that we've seen. And I think this is a question for each individual elected official: Where is the line?\"\n\nThe state's Democratic governor, Wes Moore, struck a different tone. \"Maryland will not just sit on its hands while Donald Trump continues to pick and choose which states have fair maps and which states don't when we know he's just trying to rig the rules,\" Moore said on a YouTube show last week.\n\nWhen Ferguson wrote on X that last week's elections showed \"we don't need to rig the system to win,\" dozens of Democrats argued that should not be the takeaway.\n\n\"Get our victory in Virginia out of your mouth while you echo MAGA talking points,\" Virginia state Sen. Louise Lucas wrote on X. \"Grow a pair and stand up to this President. This is just [embarrassing].\"\n\nErin Cox contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Schumer in the hotseat, again, over deal to fund government",
        "description": "WASHINGTON, Nov 10 (Reuters) - A weekend deal to end the longest U.S. government shutdown in history divided Senate Democrats and angered the party's vocal liberal base, who turned their vitriol on Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer for the second time this year.\n\nSchumer and his fellow Democrats in the Senate triggered the shutdown seeking to prevent the expiration of health insurance subsidies for 24 million Americans, a calculated move after the New York lawmaker outraged fellow Democrats in March by agreeing to a deal to avoid a shutdown.\n\nPersonally, he held firm on Sunday, voting against the measure to move towards reopening the government. But eight members of his caucus - enough to advance the measure - broke ranks, arguing that President Donald Trump's administration was taking advantage of the situation to undermine needed programs. That fracture led to fresh criticism of the 74-year-old lawmaker's leadership.\n\n\"Leadership is about changing and adapting when there is real need, and unless we hear that, we will fail to meet the moment,\" first-term Senator Elissa Slotkin of Michigan said in a statement.\n\nWhile the criticism from the left was scathing, only the 45 Democratic senators and two independents who caucus with them have a say on whether Schumer can be removed from his leadership role or defeated in a leadership election that would be held following the November 2026 elections. Schumer is not up for re-election to another six-year Senate term until 2028.\n\nProgressives took a much harsher tone, with the advocacy group \"Our Revolution\" urging Schumer to resign as minority leader, as did Representative Ro Khanna of California, who said in a statement, \"Senator Schumer is no longer effective and should be replaced.\"\n\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom, seen as a contender for the 2028 Democratic presidential nomination, on social media called the compromise \"Pathetic. This isn't a deal. It's surrender.\"\n\nDAYS AFTER ELECTION VICTORIES\n\nThe blowback came less than a week after the party celebrated wins in a handful of elections last Tuesday, which saw moderate Democrats clinch dominating wins for governor in Virginia and New Jersey and a democratic socialist elected mayor of New York City. It also reflected the frustrations of a party largely boxed out of power in Washington, where Trump's Republicans control the House of Representatives and Senate.\n\nSchumer, in a speech to the Senate on Monday, said that Democrats succeeded in putting healthcare \"at the forefront of people's minds.\"\n\n\"The American people will not forget Donald Trump's cruelty and heartlessness over the past six weeks,\" he added.\n\nJon Cowan, president of the centrist think tank Third Way, said in an interview that the attacks on Schumer coming from the left will likely subside.\n\n\"Every Democrat and allied interest group is going to end their circular firing squad and aim all of their ammunition at Trump\" and at congressional Republicans who are vulnerable to losing their seats in next year's elections, he said.\n\n'BRUTAL BLOW'\n\nSome of Schumer's fellow Senate Democrats tried to refocus the anger on Trump.\n\nWhile calling the Sunday vote to move forward on reopening the government - a process that will take several days at least - a \"brutal blow,\" Senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon added, \"The real villain is Trump and congressional Republicans.\"\n\nStill there has been pressure building in the party for years for aging leaders to step aside, clearing the way for new blood, particularly after concerns about former President Joe Biden's age played a role in the party's losses in the 2024 election that saw Trump returned to power. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in 2022 gave up her leadership role and last week said she would not seek re-election, bringing her career to a close.\n\nFor months now, Democrats have been fighting to stop significant increases in health insurance premiums with the December 31 expiration of an Affordable Care Act subsidy. Congressional Democrats had refused to allow a government funding bill to pass until their demands for renewing the subsidy were met.\n\n\"Caving on a deal that doesn't fix health care is, and always has been, a giant betrayal of the American people,\" said former Congressional Progressive Caucus Chair Pramila Jayapal of Washington State.\n\nNotably, of the eight Democrats voting yes on Sunday, six are not up for re-election next year and two are retiring, including No. 2 Senate Democrat Dick Durbin.\n\nDurbin said Schumer was disappointed when he told the Democratic leader he would vote to end the shutdown.\n\n\"He was a gentleman about it, though he disagreed with me,\" Durbin told reporters. \"I think our friendship is still intact.\"\n\nThe deal faced criticism even from party moderates - including New Jersey Governor-elect Mikie Sherrill, who called it \"malpractice.\"\n\n\"Last week we won with a broad coalition after laying out a plan that takes bold action on costs, despite political pressure and people saying it couldn't be done,\" Sherrill said in a statement. \"Voters made it clear: the American people want leadership with a backbone.\"\n\n(This story has been corrected to say that New Jersey Governor-elect is Mikie Sherrill, not Mike Sherrill, in paragraph 21)\n\nReporting by Nolan D.

        "title": "Democrats versus Democrats: shutdown fight gets bigger for one party",
        "description": "Lawmakers agree to end longest-ever government shutdown, reopen government through Jan 30\n\nWASHINGTON -- A week ago Democrats were joyous. They believed they were on their way to rebuilding trust and credibility after a wave of election victories across the country.\n\nNot anymore.\n\nAfter a handful of moderate senators cut a deal with Republicans to reopen the government, Democrats from every corner ripped the group and accused them of squandering the party's leverage.\n\nThe agreement brings back fired federal workers and funds food assistance at higher levels -- but only includes the promise of a vote to renew expiring Obamacare subsidies that were at the heart of the shutdown. The U.S. Senate on Monday passed a funding package to end the record-breaking shutdown, putting the federal government on a path to reopening in coming days.\n\nPresidential aspirants trashed Senate Democrats who crossed the aisle to support the measure. Winners from last week, including as Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey and Zohran Mamdani of New York City, are among the bill's harsh critics. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer didn't vote for the measure yet found himself in trouble anyway.\n\n\"There was a ray of light in otherwise pretty depressing year, and leave it to Democrats to misinterpret that moment -- to miss that moment,\" said Joseph Geevarghese, executive director of the progressive group Our Revolution. \"There's a fundamental disconnect between the leaders in the party and the grassroots, and I think the deal that got struck yesterday is the epitome of that disconnect.\"\n\nSchumer drew the ire of Democrats in March when he voted to keep the government open. This time he tried to force President Donald Trump's hand by backing a shutdown. Democrats held out for more than five weeks for an Obamacare vote before the moderate group announced a deal on Sunday that fell short of what the party had demanded.\n\nSherrill, a moderate New Jersey lawmaker who notched a victory last Tuesday to become governor elect, called the agreement \"malpractice\" in a statement. Mamdani, who identifies himself a democratic socialist, said it \"only exacerbates the affordability crisis\" and should be rejected.\n\n\"Voters made it clear: the American people want leadership with a backbone,\" Sherill said. \"And at a critical moment when they need leaders to stay strong under pressure, the Senate is on the brink of caving on a bill that the American people can't afford.\"\n\nThe sentiment was widely shared among as politicians and activists, who accused lawmakers in Washington of being out of touch with the party's voters.\n\nYouth group NextGen America said the \"capitulation to Trump and Republicans exemplifies why young people do not trust the party establishment\" in a statement from interim president Victoria Yang that said the \"eight Democrats, under the leadership of Senator Schumer, have caved and abandoned their own base in the process.\"\n\n\"Last Tuesday, young people showed up for Democrats down-ballot, and now, eight Senate Democrats have betrayed that trust,\" Yang said. \"This decision for many people across the country will mean skyrocketing costs on health insurance, and in some instances, the difference between life or death.\"\n\nThe deal came together after five Democrats who aren't on the ballot in 2026 agreed to flip their votes: Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, Dick Durbin of Illinois, Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire, Jacky Rosen of Nevada and Tim Kaine of Virginia. They were joined by three other members of the Democratic caucus -- Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada, John Fetterman of Pennsylvania and Angus King, an independent from Maine -- who'd been voting for Republicans' bill from the start.\n\nDurbin is the No. 2 Democrat in the Senate. He and Shaheen are both retiring.\n\n\"I honestly don't understand why senators who are leaving are making decisions for the whole party. Why were they negotiating at all?\" Center for American Progress president and CEO Neera Tanden wrote on X.\n\nTanden, a former top adviser to President Joe Biden, said the deal \"makes no sense\" and warned that Republicans \"are not going to negotiate with you\" to address the healthcare premiums.\n\nTrump insisted in the Oval Office on Nov. 10 that he would abide by the agreement.\n\nDemocratic hopeful lash out\n\nSeveral potential 2028 candidates in the party also lashed out, including former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, who said on X that it was \"a bad deal\" and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, who called it an \"empty promise.\" California Gov. Gavin Newsom, whose redistricting initiative won last week at the ballot box, panned the agreement as \"pathetic\" in a post on social media.\n\nRep. Ro Khanna went a step further and said said on X, formerly known as Twitter, that Schumer should be forced out as party leader.\n\n\"Senator Schumer is no longer effective and should be replaced. If you can't lead the fight to stop healthcare premiums from skyrocketing for Americans, what will you fight for?\" Khanna wrote.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said at a press conference that he's backing Schumer.\n\nBut the support did little to quell the uproar from liberal and progressive groups, including Our Revolution, which said it took a survey of its members after last Tuesday's elections and 90% said Schumer \"should step aside\" as party leader and 92% saying they would support a primary challenger against him.\n\nEven though Schumer voted against the bill, he shares in the blame as caucus leader, activists said.\n\n\"The buck stops with him,\" Geevarghese said. \"At the very least, he should be able to hold his members together, and he failed to do so. That's not a sign of leadership. That's ineptitude.\"\n\nThe Gen Z focused group Voters of Tomorrow said the eight senators \"have betrayed our generation,\" said that \"either through complicity or incompetence, Chuck Schumer once again proved he cannot provide the type of leadership that young Americans demand\" and needed to resign his leadership post.\n\n\"Young people don't want leaders who fold in the face of a fight. Young people's support cannot be taken for granted, it needs to be earned every day,\" the group said.\n\nMoveOn chief communications officer Joel Payne said the energy around fighters is how Democrats from different wings of the party were able to win last Tuesday.\n\nHe said the group's members have been asking, \"Who's fighting for us? Do these people understand the moment that we're in? Do they understand how much we're hurting? How scared we are? How much at risk we are?\"\n\n\"And if you can't convince the public that you get that,\" Payne said in an interview, \"that is an unsustainable political position to have right now -- if you can't convince the public that you're willing to fight.\"",

        "description": "\"If he ran the country like that, we would have an absolutely gonezo country,\" the president adds\n\nDonald Trump made it clear he was not a fan of Gavin Newsom, blasting the California politician as a \"horrible governor\" in a new interview.\n\nThe president laid into California's governor during Monday's Fox News sit-down with Laura Ingraham, where he was asked to respond to Newsom's criticism of the recent government shutdown compromise.\n\nAfter showing a clip of the governor accusing Democrat senators of rolling over and playing by the \"old set of rules\" to bring the government shut down to an end, Trump accused Newsom of going \"radical left\" with his beliefs.\n\n\"I knew Gavin for four years. I got along great with him. But he's gone radical left,\" Trump said. \"You know, he's building a train system from San Francisco to L.A. that's got about a 2,000 or 3,000% cost overrun. It's the worst thing I've [ever seen]. I've never seen anything like it.\"\n\nAs Trump went on, he criticized Newsom's response to the wildfires that ravaged Southern California earlier this year.\n\n\"They lost 25,000 houses. Do you know they haven't issued one building permit yet? These people are trying to rebuild their houses,\" Trump claimed. However, per the Rebuilding LA website run by the California government, more 984 permits have been issued in the City of Los Angeles and 780 permits have been issued in the greater County of Los Angeles.\n\nHe continued: \"He did something even worse than that. He's now taking a big section of [Pacific] Palisades or some area and he's going to build low-income housing where they used to have luxury housing ... his fire stuff is out of control.\"\n\nWhile Trump noted that he \"always liked [Newsom],\" he slammed the California Democrat as \"a horrible governor.\"\n\n\"If he ran the country like that, we would have an absolutely gonezo country,\" Trump added. \"This country would be gone. The fact is, if I weren't president, if Kamala [Harris] got in, you wouldn't have $20 trillion coming in, you'd have money leaving.\"\n\nAt this point, Trump transitioned away from his criticism of Newsom and focused on the country's welfare system, including SNAP benefits.\n\n\"SNAP is supposed to be if you are down and out,\" he lamented. \"That's what the purpose of it -- people walk in and they get it automatically now. So, the number is many times what it should be.\"\n\nWatch more from Trump's interview with Ingraham above.",

        "title": "Did Democrats Win the Shutdown After All?",
        "description": "On October 1st, in the hours after Senate Democrats forced a government shutdown, I argued that starting a fight seemed to be the point. Earlier in the year, Chuck Schumer, the Minority Leader, had rallied enough votes to keep the government open and faced a furious backlash from the Democratic base; capitulating again would have been politically intolerable. As the Times columnist Ezra Klein observed, a shutdown also presented the Democrats with an opportunity to focus public attention on President Donald Trump's corruption, turning what had been a \"diffuse crisis\" into an \"acute\" one. In the end, the Democrats mostly oriented their demands toward health care -- above all, the renewal of expiring Obamacare subsidies -- as opposed to, say, prioritizing more abstract ultimatums related to creeping authoritarianism. (Klein suggested that the two could be linked.) The health-care dispute looked like typical grist for a shutdown, insofar as such events can be considered typical at all: before the current one, there had only been three of significant length. On those occasions, the party forcing the issue wilted under public pressure without getting what it came for, as the other side pointed to the intensifying costs for federal workers and average Americans.\n\nWhat happened next, this time, was strange, and not uniformly validating for the Democrats' strategy. The shutdown became a big news story, of course, but didn't concentrate attention to the degree one might have expected -- in no small part because, in Trump's Washington, there's always something else going on. Not enough pressure mounted on the Democrats to give in, either. Republicans tried to make them take difficult votes to reopen the government, but those attempts never really cut through; as one G.O.P. strategist noted, the mainstream press lacked its past power to push a unified narrative that one side or the other appeared to be winning. To the extent that the press did do this, the answer was that it was good for Democrats: polls mostly showed them getting blamed less than Trump and other Republicans, whose ability, at least in principle, to drum up sympathy for federal workers was hamstrung by the Administration using the shutdown as a pretext to fire a bunch of them. Last week, Democrats swept the board in off-year elections across the country. Whatever role the shutdown played in those results, Trump put it center stage by declaring that the Republicans' handling of it was a major reason for their bad night, then loudly urged his party's majority in the Senate to nix the filibuster, a move that would have enabled them to reopen the government unilaterally. Democrats appeared to have all the momentum.\n\nThen, on Sunday, eight moderate members of the Democratic caucus in the Senate voted with Republicans to move forward with a plan that would reopen the government, circumventing the filibuster; under the terms of the deal, agencies and programs will be funded through January (and in some cases beyond), laid-off federal workers will be reinstated, and the Obamacare subsidies will come up for a separate vote next month, but its success is far from guaranteed. Cue more furious backlash from the Democratic base. When I logged onto Bluesky this morning, I saw the eight Senators being referred to as \"Cavers,\" \"Turncoats,\" \"Chickenshits,\" and \"Fuckers\" (all in one post); as \"QUISLINGS\"; and as \"Pathetic.\" The last of those darts was fired (initially on X) by Gavin Newsom, the governor of California, who is a resistance darling of the moment after forcing through new, Democrat-friendly congressional maps in his state last week. Other Party bigwigs expressed disappointment, too, from the progressives Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren to the milquetoast Democratic National Committee leader Ken Martin. A group of Democrats ended the shutdown \"in return for -- if we're being honest -- very little,\" Klein wrote, in the Times. \"If I were in the Senate, I wouldn't vote for this compromise.\"",

        "title": "Lefty Dems go scorched earth over ending government shutdown -- take...",
        "description": "WASHINGTON -- Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) is taking heat from the far left of his party to step aside after the record-breaking government shutdown looked set to end with nothing to show for it.\n\nThe fumbled finish to the 41-day shutdown has Democrats bashing each other, with one senator, Angus King (I-Maine), admitting, \"standing up to Trump didn't work.\"\n\nMuch of the fury is aimed at the Senate Minority Leader, 74, who claimed he opposed the capitulation deal, but whose No. 2, Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Illinois), was one of eight senators to join Republicans on a plan to end the impasse that has grounded flights, furloughed federal workers, and put food stamps for hungry families on hold.\n\n\"Schumer -- for better or worse -- is the living embodiment of the phrase damned if you do, damned if you don't,\" one House Dem aide observed to The Post.\n\nDemocratic New York state Sen. James Skoufis put it more bluntly: \"My four-year-old daughter negotiates better deals on the playground than what we saw this week.\"\n\nThe firestorm is part of broader Democratic Party infighting, as the democratic socialist-charged wing of the party wants to see its pols deploy scorched-earth tactics.\n\nAnd the knives were already out for Schumer, specifically, and the shutdown offered an opening to air grievances about calls for generational change in the party.\n\n\"Every politician needs to realize their sell-by date. Schumer played an instrumental role in passing Chips, IRA [Inflation Reduction Act] and Infrastructure,\" Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) told The Post.\n\n\"But his support for the Iraq war, for unconditional military aid to [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu and his caving on both shutdown fights make it painfully obvious he is not the leader for the Democratic party today. He should gracefully step aside from leadership like [Rep. Nancy] Pelosi did and serve out the remainder of his term with dignity.\"\n\nSchumer, however, retained public support from his colleagues in the upper chamber.\n\n\"None of these people are senators or know the details of what happened in the Senate this week,\" a Schumer spokesman told The Post of the calls for him to step aside. \"Sen. Schumer has led the fight on the healthcare crisis, and will continue to do so.\"\n\nSchumer voted against advancing the bipartisan package to end the longest government shutdown in US history, but endured the brunt of the base's wrath for failing to keep his caucus from holding out longer, especially after Tuesday's election wins in New Jersey, Virginia, and New York City galvanized the progressive base.\n\nDespite no plan to extend the pandemic-era Obamacare subsidies that are slated to expire this year -- the key objective of Dems' shutdown fight -- Schumer said that the party brought healthcare to the forefront.\n\n\"The American people have now awoken to Trump's healthcare crisis,\" Schumer said Monday on the Senate floor. \"Healthcare is once again at the forefront of people's minds. People now see that premiums are about to skyrocket. They're terrified about how they're going to pay for insurance.\"\n\nHouse Democratic Leader, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) backed his Brooklyn colleague, saying he \"waged a valiant fight on behalf of the American people.\"\n\nThe fact that five Democrats -- the exact number needed -- abruptly flipped their vote on Sunday and that almost all of them are either retiring or aren't up for reelection until 2030, has fueled distrust and sneaky suspicions that the surrender was coordinated with others in the caucus. Progress Action Fund founder Joe Jacobson called for primaries against them all, adding in a statement, \"These feeble Democrats didn't cross the aisle. They crossed the f-king line.\"\n\n\"Many suspect he [Schumer] actually did generally agree with this path forward, but couldn't personally support it for his own political calculations, which is sh -- y for its own set of reasons,\" that source added, noting that House Dems are \"pretty upset\" with the Senate defectors.\n\nSen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) denied that Schumer backed the shutdown deal, saying he \"fought like hell against\" it.\n\nSchumer isn't up for reelection until 2028, and could face a primary challenge from Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, 36, who has energized the progressive base.\n\nOthers downplayed the attacks on Schumer as publicity stunts.\n\n\"It seems the only time Democrats like Mr. Khanna get their name in the news is when they cry,\" said one Hill source. \"Schumer seems to have held an avalanche back for 40 days. He didn't cry.\"\n\nFor months, Democrats and progressive activists seethed as President Trump and the GOP racked up win after win, while they were all but powerless to stop any of it.\n\nThe government shutdown proved to be a rare point of leverage Democrats had against Republicans - some on the left aren't ready to give that up.\n\nSo far, no member of the Senate Democratic Caucus has publicly called on Schumer to step aside. But some Dem candidates vying for the Senate are implying that Schumer should step aside, including Rep. Seth Moulton (D-Mass), Maine Senate candidate Graham Platner, and Iowa state Sen. Zach Wahls.\n\nDem pols with an eye on the 2028 presidential cycle, such as California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D), former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, and others rebuked the Senate defectors.\n\n\"Democrats are justifiably angry because, other than the promise of a symbolic, one-house vote on the ACA subsidies, nothing was won for the American people in this so-called deal,\" Skoufis, the New York Dem lawmaker, said.",

        "title": "The pointless government shutdown is over -- but Schumer and Dems'...",
        "description": "Our long national nightmare is over, but the Democratic psychodrama isn't.\n\nThe longest shutdown in US history -- with increasing pain points across the country, whether among travelers or SNAP recipients -- is ending, while the Democratic recriminations are just getting started.\n\n\"It's complete BS,\" was a relatively mild take on the deal from one congressional progressive.\n\nAs a rule of thumb, government shutdowns are bootless exercises. They rarely work because the party that causes the shutdown, thinking that it will provide leverage, invariably gets blamed for the shutdown and then -- surprise! -- ends up in a worse position than where it began.\n\nDemocrats managed to escape the worst political fallout from their weeks-long refusal to fund the government. Otherwise, their tactic failed, and predictably so.\n\nNo Democratic senators have been seen wearing T-shirts saying, \"I caused disruption and heartache for millions, and all I got was a meaningless promise for a lousy vote,\" but they would be apt.\n\nThe shutdown was supposedly all about securing more Obamacare subsidies. This connection was entirely arbitrary, though. At the beginning of the shutdown, the Democrats spun the wheel and the bouncing ball landed on \"health care.\"\n\nThey just as easily could have picked immigration, climate, or LGBTQIA+ policy as the reason they wanted a shutdown. The advantage of health care is that it's the one issue where Democrats still have a significant advantage.\n\nThey maintained it was it so imperative that Republicans extend forever Obamacare subsidies first passed in 2021 and then re-upped in 2022 under Joe Biden -- without a single Republican vote either time -- that it was worth shutting down the government over.\n\nRepublicans have sounded defensive about health care during the fight, but the Democratic demand was so extravagant, and the bad faith so obvious, that the GOP was never going to cave.\n\nSure enough, the GOP held firm, and as the shutdown began to bite, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer reduced the ask to a one-year extension of the subsidies.\n\nWhen that went nowhere, a band of relatively moderate Democratic senators broke ranks to support a deal for a mere Senate vote on continued subsidies. Not a guarantee of passage. Not even a promise of a vote in both houses of Congress. No, just a Senate vote on a Democratic priority that will probably fail.\n\nNo wonder progressives are livid, but when isn't that the case? In the Trump years, to be progressive is to constantly feel an implacable sense of impotence and rage. This was the real reason for the shutdown -- it was a readily available instrument for expressing an unreasoning hatred of Donald Trump.\n\nDemocrats believed that the moment, as Otter famously said in the movie \"Animal House,\" required a \"stupid and futile gesture,\" and acted accordingly.\n\nOn top of this, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer desperately wanted to appease the Democratic base. The aging New Yorker is so vulnerable to a potential primary challenge from progressive heartthrob Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez that he must look to her now the way a wounded wildebeest does to a hungry lion.\n\nSchumer had MSNBC viewers burning him in effigy earlier in the year when he refused to shut down the government. He didn't want to make that mistake again, but the flaw in his plan was that it only meant delaying the inevitable.\n\nRather then infuriating their base by not shutting down the government, Democrats have infuriated their base by moving to re-open the government a few weeks after shutting it down. Progressives are still calling for Schumer's head, even though he theoretically opposes the deal.\n\nMost congressional Democrats surely realize that it would be unsustainable to continue to keep the government closed. Still, they aren't going to let that get in the way of their public posturing. They are both glad that people on their side are willing to do the right thing by voting to fund the government, and glad that these other people -- not them -- are taking the fall for it.\n\nNotably, presumptive 2028 presidential hopefuls Gavin Newsom and Pete Buttigieg opposed the deal, knowing that maximal opposition to Trump is the price for entry in Democratic primary politics.\n\nIn short, the government shutdown may have been pointless and dumb, but there is much more where that came from.",

        "description": "BELEM, Brazil, Nov 10 (Reuters) - The COP30 climate summit opened on Monday with the U.N. climate chief urging countries to cooperate rather than battle over priorities, as efforts to limit global warming are threatened by a fracturing international consensus.\n\nHost country Brazil brokered a deal on the agenda for the two-week summit in the Amazon city of Belem, deflecting attempts by developing-country negotiating blocs to shoehorn contentious issues like climate finance and carbon taxes into the talks.\n\nIt was unclear whether countries would aim to negotiate a final agreement for the end of the event - a hard sell in a year of fractious global politics and U.S. efforts to obstruct a transition away from fossil fuels.\n\nSome including Brazil have suggested that countries focus on smaller efforts that do not need consensus, such as deforestation, after years of COP summits making lofty promises only to leave many unfulfilled.\n\n\"In this arena of COP30, your job here is not to fight one another - your job here is to fight this climate crisis, together,\" U.N. Climate Change Executive Secretary Simon Stiell told delegates from more than 190 countries attending.\n\nHe said three decades of U.N. climate talks had helped to bend the curve in projected warming downward, \"because of what was agreed in halls like this, with governments legislating, and markets responding. But I am not sugar-coating it. We have so much more work to do.\"\n\nA new U.N. analysis of countries' emissions-cutting plans estimated that global greenhouse gases would decrease 12% by 2035 from 2019 levels, improving on an earlier estimate of 10% published last month.\n\nThe new figure takes into account the most recent pledges, including from China and the EU, but was still short of the 60% emissions drop needed by 2035 to limit global warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial temperatures - the threshold beyond which scientists say climate change would unleash far more severe impacts.\n\nBrazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva warned against interests trying to obscure the dangers of climate change.\n\n\"They attack the institutions, the science, the universities,\" he said. \"It's time to impose another defeat to denialists.\"\n\nThe world's biggest historical emitter of greenhouse gases - the United States - opted to skip the summit; U.S. President Donald Trump falsely asserts that climate change is a hoax.\n\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom and New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham were expected in Belem on Tuesday.\n\n\"What the hell is going on here?\" Newsom said of the U.S. government's absence from the talks, addressing a global investors summit held on Monday in Sao Paulo.\n\n\"We're in Brazil, one of our great trading partners, one of the world's great democracies. I mean, hell, home to all the rare earth metals we need. This is the country we should be engaging with instead of giving the middle finger with 50% tariffs,\" Newsom said, referring to duties imposed by the Trump administration.\n\nCOP30 President Andre Correa do Lago told a news conference: \"I think that the absence of the U.S. ... has opened some space for the world to see what developing countries are doing.\"\n\nGermany said European countries would push for commitments to rein in fossil fuel use - a goal promoted by Lula.\n\n\"We will advocate for something strong,\" German Vice Minister Jochen Flasbarth told Reuters. \"We don't want to go the same way of President Trump and accuse others of being wrong. We want to listen.\"\n\nWARNING SIGNS\n\nCountries were joined by Indigenous leaders, who arrived on Sunday by boat after traveling some 3,000 km (1,864 miles) from the Andes. They are demanding more say in how their territories are managed as climate change escalates and industries such as mining, logging and oil drilling push deeper into forests.\n\n\"We want to make sure that they don't keep promising, that they will start protecting, because we as Indigenous people are the ones who suffer from these impacts of climate change,\" said Pablo Inuma Flores, an Indigenous leader from Peru.\n\nScientists at dozens of universities and international science institutions sounded an alarm over the world's thawing glaciers, ice sheets, and other frozen spaces.\n\n\"The cryosphere is destabilizing at an alarming pace,\" the groups said in a letter to COP30 published on Monday. \"Geopolitical tensions or short-term national interests must not overshadow COP30.

        "description": "In the aftermath of the Oct. 7 attack on Israel by Hamas two years ago, high school teacher Josh Hirsch posted comments on social media in support of Israel. It was unrealistic for Hamas to expect a ceasefire, he wrote, as long as they were holding hostages.\n\nSoon afterward, a former student called for his firing. A note taped outside the door of his Adams County, Colorado, classroom contained his wife's name and their home address. And a sticker that appeared on his chair read: \"Israel is committing genocide in Gaza.\"\n\nThe reaction startled Mr. Hirsch, the only Jewish teacher in his school building. For the first time in his 14-year career, he considered quitting. He stayed and joined an educators' advocacy network created by the Anti-Defamation League, a way he saw to make schools more inclusive of diverse viewpoints.\n\n\"I've been a teacher and tried to keep my focus on being the best teacher I could,\" he said.\n\nTensions over the Israel-Hamas war have spilled into schools around the U.S., with advocates reporting a rise in antisemitic harassment since the 2023 surprise attack on Israel. While some argue school leaders have failed to take the threat seriously, others warn criticism of Israel and the military campaign in Gaza are interpreted too often as hate speech.\n\nThe Trump administration has not punished school systems the way it has hit colleges accused of tolerating antisemitism, but schools are still facing pressure to respond more aggressively. Several states have pressed for new vigilance, including legislation that critics say would stifle free speech.\n\nLawmakers in Texas, Arkansas, Oklahoma and Tennessee have passed measures to increase school accountability for complaints of antisemitism, and a law signed by California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, will provide training to identify and prevent antisemitism in schools.\n\nIn Arizona, the Democratic governor vetoed a bill on how to deal with reports of antisemitism in schools, calling it an attack on educators.\n\nMany of the measures, including one signed by Oklahoma's Republican governor, call for adoption of a definition of antisemitism that casts certain criticism of Israel as hate speech.\n\n\"These bills make it clear that Oklahoma stands with our Jewish communities and will not tolerate hatred disguised as political discourse,\" said Kristen Thompson, a Republican state senator in Oklahoma who wrote the legislation.\n\nDozens of states have adopted the definition promoted by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance, which is also recognized by the State Department. It lists 11 examples of antisemitic conduct, such as applying \"double standards\" to Israel or comparing the country's policies to Nazism.\n\nWhile supporters of this definition of antisemitism say it is necessary to combat evolving forms of Jewish hate, civil liberties groups warn it suppresses pro-Palestinian speech.\n\nThe Trump administration has leveraged antisemitism investigations in its efforts to reshape higher education, suspending billions of dollars in federal funding to Harvard, Columbia and other universities over allegations they tolerated hate speech, especially during protests over the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nThe White House has not gotten as involved at the K-12 level. At congressional hearings, House Republicans have taken some large school systems to task over their handling of antisemitism, but the administration largely has left it to the Education Department's Office for Civil Rights to address complaints.\n\nIn one of the cases under investigation, a complaint described students at the Berkeley Unified School District in California asking Jewish classmates what \"their number is,\" referring to numbers tattooed on Jews during the Holocaust. It also said teachers made antisemitic comments and led walkouts that praised Hamas.\n\nThe district did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn another California case, the family of a 14-year-old girl filed a federal lawsuit last year alleging she had to leave University Preparatory Academy, a charter school in San Jose, in 2023 because of antisemitic bullying. After the Hamas attack, she said students called her names, including \"terrorist.\" The California Department of Education and the school said they could not comment on pending litigation.\n\nNationwide, the ADL recorded 860 antisemitic incidents in non-Jewish schools last year, ranging from name-calling and swastikas etched on lockers to antisemitic materials being taught in classrooms. The number was down from more than 1,100 recorded in 2023, but well above numbers in prior years, according to the ADL.\n\nA Massachusetts state commission formed last year to combat antisemitism found it was a \"pervasive and escalating problem\" in schools.\n\nAt one meeting, a commission co-chair, Democratic state Rep. Simon Cataldo, said the Massachusetts Teachers Association was sharing antisemitic resources with teachers, including a kindergarten workbook that describes Zionists as \"bullies\" and an image of a Star of David made of dollar bills. The union said those were singled out among hundreds of images in art and posters about Palestinians, and links to those materials were removed.\n\nThe union said it has engaged in efforts to confront increases in antisemitism and Islamophobia and accused the commission of \"offensive political theater.\"\n\n\"Those who manipulate antisemitism to achieve political objectives -- such as undermining labor unions and public educators -- are following the lead of the Trump administration,\" the union said in a statement.",

        "title": "Gavin Newsom's Texas 'victory lap' breaks faith with Californians...",
        "description": "California Gov. Gavin Newsom received a hero's welcome from fellow Democrats in Texas this weekend after his victory in the Proposition 50 referendum.\n\nThe California ballot initiative passed overwhelmingly, despite the fact that it ripped power away from the public and placed it back in the hands of politicians -- i.e. Democrats -- to redraw congressional districts and eliminate the Republican opposition.\n\nNewsom cast the vote in terms of national politics, telling Californians it was a way to push back against President Donald Trump, who remains unpopular in the state.\n\nHe also claimed his gerrymandering was a response to Texas Republicans, who redrew their own districts to comply with recent Supreme Court rulings that limited the use of race in district boundaries -- and eliminated five Democrat-held seats in the process.\n\nNewsom, seen until now -- even within his own party -- as a slick, entitled politician, can now claim to have done more than any other Democrat to level the playing field ahead of the crucial 2026 midterm elections.\n\nThat, in turn, places him in a unique position to make his case for the party's presidential nomination in 2028.\n\nNewsom excels in trolling Republicans -- which is why he hung around the GOP primary debates in 2023, and why he went to Texas this weekend to taunt the opposition.\n\nBut while he was gone, Californians continued to suffer the brunt of his policies.\n\nFire victims in Pacific Palisades and Altadena, for example, still endure endless delays -- both from insurance companies, which are reluctant to pay claims, and from local officials, who are dragging their feet in approving permits to rebuild.\n\nLocal residents, desperate for help, are calling for California Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara to resign, and demanding that Newsom ask him to step down.\n\nThe governor has yet to respond.\n\nHe is more concerned with what he calls the \"de facto\" end of the Trump presidency, which he promises will follow after the midterm elections.\n\nHow he hopes to convince Trump to approve $40 billion in requested federal fire aid after such antics is anyone's guess.\n\nThe state itself could help in any number of ways -- such as buying construction materials at discount bulk prices, which could lower costs for local families.\n\nIt could also develop long-term strategies to mitigate the danger of wildfires -- something Newsom has rejected in recent weeks, saying it would cost too much for a state that has struggled with budget deficits for the past two years.\n\nNewsom has other priorities: He spent $282.6 million of public money on the special election for Prop 50.\n\nMeanwhile, fuel is accumulating on public land -- like the land on which the Palisades Fire began, after being kindled from an earlier fire that state and local authorities failed to put out.\n\nNewsom is taking a calculated gamble: That Democratic Party primary voters will care more about how vigorously a candidate fought the Trump administration than how well he or she performed in office.\n\nFor the sake of his political future, he'd better be right.\n\nAfter nearly two terms in office as governor, following eight years as lieutenant governor and two terms as mayor of San Francisco, it is difficult to name a single real achievement in Newsom's long career.\n\nHe has simply failed upward.\n\nThe one thing Newsom has done well is to pick fights with Trump and with other Republicans, such as Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, usually over social issues.\n\nMost of the country disagrees with Newsom's far-left positions on issues like transgenderism, such as a state law punishing school districts that inform parents of children's gender changes.\n\nBut Newsom knows his party is desperate for a candidate who can fight -- even one who leaves his own state behind.",

        "title": "Senate government shutdown deal leaves many Democrats furious, with little to show on health care after 40 days",
        "description": "Washington -- The decision by eight Democratic senators to embrace a deal to end the government shutdown has infuriated many members of the party, with critics saying the lawmakers abandoned the 40-day fight without serious concessions on the health care tax credits that were central to Democrats' demands.\n\n\"Pathetic,\" California Gov. Gavin Newsom said. \"There's no way to defend this,\" Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut argued. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, said \"it would be a policy and political disaster for the Democrats to cave.\"\n\nThe reaction is a reflection of the frustration among many Democrats, particularly progressives, who had urged their party to keep fighting after the strong Democratic performance in last week's elections. But the shutdown's ongoing toll was ultimately too steep for some of the party's more moderate members to stomach.\n\nThe resulting deal has exposed fault lines within the party that could reverberate over the months ahead and frame the party's internal debate heading into the primaries for next year's midterm elections. And it has led some congressional Democrats and progressive groups to call for Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer to step down, despite his personal opposition to the agreement.\n\nThe Democrats who broke ranks and voted to move forward had been engaged in bipartisan talks to find an off-ramp for several weeks. Led by Sens. Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire and Sen. Angus King of Maine, the deal they struck secured a vote next month on Affordable Care Act tax credits that Democrats have sought to extend.\n\nBut the agreement doesn't guarantee an outcome of the vote, and most Republicans have made no secret of their opposition to extending the subsidies. Even if some version of an extension does pass the Senate, House Speaker Mike Johnson has not committed to bringing it up in the House.\n\n\"I understand the frustration and obviously I didn't agree with that decision,\" Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii told reporters Monday. \"But what we have to make sure of now is that the health care fight lives outside of the appropriations process and doesn't depend entirely on the government being shut down. So now we have a fight in front of us.\"\n\nThe Senate Democrats who crossed the aisle have pointed to other provisions in the agreement to argue it was worthy of support. A new version of the funding bill would reverse all government layoffs that occurred during the shutdown and prevent them for a limited time going forward. The deal would also restore funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program at higher levels, and pave the way for a bipartisan appropriations process on other spending bills.\n\nThe eight Democrats also argued there is value in putting Republicans on the record with a vote on the health insurance issue, which Democrats have thrust into the spotlight with the shutdown fight. The moderates viewed the deal -- after Republicans leaders refused to budge -- as the best possible offer they could secure.\n\n\"We stood up to President Trump for 40 days,\" Shaheen said on \"CBS Mornings\" Monday.\n\nThe New Hampshire Democrat defended the move to cross the aisle despite the lack of tangible progress on health care, saying \"we're going to be able to continue fighting on that issue because of the agreement that we struck with the Senate majority.\"\n\n\"But we're also going to end the suffering of millions of Americans,\" she said, pointing to the millions of people who have not received food assistance, and the federal employees and air traffic controllers who have not received paychecks.\n\n\"And we're going to live to fight another day -- and that's what we need to keep people focused on,\" Shaheen said. \"It's not the Democrats who broke ranks who are the issue here.\"\n\nCritics are also directing ire at the party's leaders for allowing the defections. Almost immediately after the details of the deal came to light, Schumer faced calls for his replacement as the party's leader in the upper chamber.\n\n\"It's time for him to be replaced. He is not meeting the moment. He's out of touch with where the party's base is,\" Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California told CBS News.\n\n\"Tonight is another example of why we need new leadership. If [Schumer] were an effective leader, he would have united his caucus to vote 'No' tonight and hold the line on healthcare,\" wrote Rep. Seth Moulton of Massachusetts, a Democrat who is running for Senate.\n\nFor his part, Schumer outlined his own opposition to advancing the measure to fund the government Sunday, railing against Republicans for refusing to engage with Democrats on the health care issue during the shutdown while pledging to continue the fight.\n\n\"I must vote no -- this health care crisis is so severe, so urgent, so devastating for families back home that I cannot in good faith support this CR that fails to address the health care crisis,\" Schumer said on the Senate floor ahead of the vote.\n\nLate last week, Schumer said Democrats would reopen the government if Republicans agreed to a one-year extension of the health insurance tax credits. But Republicans swiftly rejected the offer.\n\nThe New York Democrat faced a windstorm of criticism during the last funding fight in March, when he voted to advance a GOP-led continuing resolution. This time around, Schumer made a point of putting up a fight, engaging early with Republicans and the White House to negotiate a deal on health care while keeping his caucus largely unified against the GOP's funding plan for almost two months. Still, since the beginning it appeared unlikely that the leader would make it out of the funding fight completely unscathed.",

        "title": "'A very bad night': Democrats face blowback from their own party over shutdown deal",
        "description": "Sen. Chris Murphy argued there was \"no way to defend\" the yes vote.\n\nEight senators who caucus with Democrats broke rank on Sunday and forwent extending the Affordable Care Act subsidies set to expire at the end of the year -- a move could bring an end to the government shutdown, but has led to criticism from many within their own party.\n\nSens. Angus King, Tim Kaine, Dick Durbin, John Fetterman, Magie Hassan, Jeanne Shaheen, Catherine Cortez Masto and Jacky Rosen -- none of whom are up for reelection 2026 -- voted Sunday to support a short-term funding bill that would reopen the government through Jan. 30.\n\nThe 60-40 vote barely put the continuing resolution over the finish line in the Senate, and the legislation will need to pass in the GOP-controlled House and receive President Donald Trump's signature before it can go into effect and fund the government.\n\nIn the end, Democrats did not receive their one key demand in the shutdown battle: extending Affordable Care Act subsidies that are set to expire at the end of this year. Instead, the deal promises a vote on health care subsidies in the coming weeks -- something Senate Majority Leader John Thune had already offered as part of a deal over a month ago.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders, an independent who has been a vocal leader in the fight to extend health care subsidies, posted a video on X Sunday night captioned: \"Tonight was a very bad night.\"\n\n\"This was a very, very bad vote,\" Sanders said, adding that the deal \"raises health care premiums for over 20 million Americans\" and \"paves the way for 15 million people to be thrown off of Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act.\"\n\nSanders said last week's elections -- in which Democrats across the country won by historic margins -- shows that \"the American people want us to stand up to Trumpism, to his war against working-class people, to his authoritarianism. That is what the American people wanted. But tonight, that is not what happened.\"\n\nSanders was not alone. Sen. Elizabeth Warren said the party \"lost\" the fight over health care. Sen. Chris Murphy argued there was \"no way to defend\" the yes vote.\n\n\"My fear is that Trump gets stronger, not weaker, because of this acquiescence,\" Murphy wrote on X.\n\nSeveral key Democratic governors, some of whom are rumored to be considering a bid for the White House in 2028, are criticizing the deal. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz called the negotiations a \"deeply disappointing result\" with the administration steamrolling Congress. Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker wrote in a post on X that instead of a deal, it's an \"empty promise,\" and California Gov. Gavin Newsom curtly called the move by Senate Democrats \"pathetic.\"\n\nHouse Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries on Monday said the party will continue to fight for health care, adding that the Democratic senators who voted for the GOP plan will have to defend their votes.\n\n\"With respect to senators ... they are going to have to explain themselves,\" Jeffries said during a news conference Monday.\n\nAnd as a consequence, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, despite voting no on the Republican spending bill, has faced calls from Democrats in Congress to step down from Senate leadership over his failure to keep members of his party in line.\n\nSome Democrats, such as progressive Rep. Rho Khanna, are calling for Schumer to walk away from the job entirely.\n\n\"Senator Schumer is no longer effective and should be replaced,\" Khanna wrote on X Sunday night. \"If you can't lead the fight to stop healthcare premiums from skyrocketing for Americans, what will you fight for?\"\n\nDemocratic Rep. Mike Levin wrote on X on Monday that \"Chuck Schumer has not met this moment and Senate Democrats would be wise to move on from his leadership.\"\n\nSchumer, meanwhile, has vowed to \"keep fighting\" in the battle for health care.\n\nThe rouge Democrats defended their yes vote Sunday night, claiming that Republicans would now work with them on the issue of health care.\n\n\"After weeks of bipartisan conversations, I voted today to reopen the government so that we can get back to the work of helping families. This agreement funds SNAP and food assistance programs ensures that law enforcement, air traffic controllers and other federal workers get paid, reverses the president's recent reckless layoffs and prevents them from happening in the future, and crucially, gives Congress a clear path forward to protecting people's health care,\" Hassan said Sunday.\n\n\"And if [a deal on health care] is not successful, then shame on the Republican party and shame on Donald Trump. But the American people will see who stands with them on health care and who does not, and that will be the platform of the next stage of the fight,\" added Shaheen.\n\nOn Capitol Hill Sunday night, Kaine, Hassan, Shaheen, Cortez Masto and King stressed there is still a critical need for ACA tax credits, but that the impact of the government shutdown was becoming too dire. Additionally, the group said the Republicans were \"clear\" in their refusal to negotiate with Democrats over health care while the government remained closed.",

Those eyeing the White House can't believe they caved.\n\nAfter Senate Democrats joined Republicans to advance a government funding bill late Sunday night, fellow party members -- and possible 2028 presidential hopefuls -- unleashed a torrent of criticism.\n\nDemocrats held the line for more than six weeks to extend expiring Affordable Care Act subsidies, leading to the longest government shutdown in history. But eight senators -- seven Democrats and Angus King of Maine, an independent who caucuses with Democrats -- broke rank Sunday.\n\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., previously offered to give Democrats a vote on the expiring subsidies after the government was reopened. But there is no official guarantee a vote will be held on the matter -- which Democrats reportedly eyeing the nation's highest office have been quick to point out:\n\nSen. Ruben Gallego of Arizona -- among the prominent Democrats who recently helped Reps. Mikie Sherrill and Abigail Spanberger successfully campaign for governor in New Jersey and Virginia, respectively -- called the compromise \"a show.\"\n\n\"There's a phrase in Spanish, 'Con salud, lo hay todo; sin salud, no hay nada,'\" Gallego wrote on X. \"It means 'With good health you have it all; without your health, you have nothing.'\"\n\nRep. Ro Khanna, who is leading the charge on a discharge petition that would force a vote to release all of the government's files related to Jeffrey Epstein, called for the ouster of Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer: \"Senator Schumer is no longer effective and should be replaced. If you can't lead the fight to stop healthcare premiums from skyrocketing for Americans, what will you fight for?\"\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar, who ran for president in 2020, said she voted against the budget bill \"because it does not prevent health insurance premiums from doubling for so many Americans. The President and Congressional Republicans should have come to the table to work with us to lower these costs.\"\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom, considered a serious contender for the Democratic presidential nomination, called the move to advance the funding bill \"pathetic\" and lambasted the senators who defected, writing on X: \"America deserves better.\"\n\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, whose name has also been floated for the party's nomination, said the deal lets down all constituents, not just registered Democrats: \"People want us to hold the line for a reason. This is not a matter of appealing to a base. It's about people's lives. Working people want leaders whose word means something.\"\n\nSaid Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, who has locked horns with the Trump administration over immigration raids and the surge of federal forces in Chicago: \"This is not a deal -- it's an empty promise.\"\n\nSen. Elissa Slotkin from the swing state of Michigan also reaffirmed her decision to vote \"no\" on a deal to reopen the government: \"Since July, I have been clear: to earn my vote, Republicans would have to do something to bring down the cost of health care for working and middle-class Michiganders. The promise of a vote in over a month does not meet that threshold.\"",

        "description": "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.\n\nA district judge in Utah is expected to make a blockbuster ruling on Monday on which of three congressional maps the red state will use in the 2026 midterm elections.\n\nThe decision by Utah District Judge Dianna Gibson on which map she chooses could determine if Democrats have a fighting chance next year of flipping one of the state's current four Republican-controlled U.S. House seats.\n\nUtah is the latest state to find itself smack in the middle of the high-stakes redistricting showdown between President Donald Trump and Republicans versus Democrats to shape the midterm battlefield in the fight for the House majority.\n\nThe faceoff over redistricting in Utah, a state Trump carried by nearly 22 points in last year's presidential election, was triggered by a lawsuit by the League of Women Voters of Utah and Mormon Women for Ethical Government, which prompted Gibson to throw out the state's current congressional map. The plaintiffs argued that the current map favored Republicans.\n\nNEWSOM TAKES VICTORY LAP AFTER LANDSLIDE REDISTRICTING VICTORY IN CALIFORNIA\n\nGibson's move required the GOP-controlled state legislature to draw a new map, which lawmakers approved last month.\n\nThe map drawn by the legislature could give Democrats a chance of flipping a U.S. House seat in two of the state's four districts.\n\nGibson, who will choose between the legislature's map and two others drawn up by the plaintiffs, said she would rule by Nov. 10, which is the day Utah Lt. Gov Deidre Henderson said any new congressional map must be in place to be used in next year's elections.\n\nTRUMP-BACKED REDISTRICTING PUSH TURNS MIDWESTERN STATE INTO NEXT POLITICAL BATTLEGROUND\n\nThe ruling in Utah comes six days after California voters overwhelmingly passed Proposition 50, a ballot initiative which will temporarily sidetrack the left-leaning state's nonpartisan redistricting commission and return the power to draw the congressional maps to the Democrat-dominated legislature.\n\nThat is expected to result in five more Democratic-leaning congressional districts in California, which would counter the passage earlier this year in the reliable red state of Texas of a new map that aims to create up to five right-leaning House seats.\n\n\"California stepped up. Now, we are taking this fight across the country -- helping Democrats in other states push back against Trump's election rigging,\" California Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a statement to Fox News Digital last week, as he pointed to the push by Trump and Republicans for rare mid-decade redistricting.\n\nIt's part of a broad effort by Trump's political team and the GOP to pad the party's razor-thin House majority to keep control of the chamber in the 2026 midterms when the party in power traditionally faces political headwinds and loses seats. Missouri, North Carolina, and Ohio have drawn new maps as part of the president's push.\n\nCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nTrump is aiming to prevent what happened during his first term in the White House when Democrats reclaimed the House majority in the 2018 midterm elections.\n\nIllinois and Maryland, two blue states, and Virginia, where Democrats control the legislature, are moving towards redistricting or are seriously considering, as are the red states of Indiana, Kansas, and Florida.",

        "description": "Two weeks before the New York City mayoral election, Zohran Mamdani made an appearance on \"Flagrant,\" an edgy, anti-woke podcast hosted by the comedian Andrew Schulz. Riffing and smiling through the hourlong conversation, Mr. Mamdani hit his talking points about affordability and housing with ease. When the hosts teased him about his inability to bench press 135 pounds, he didn't flinch.\n\n\"Next year, 136,\" Mr. Mamdani, 34, said as Mr. Schulz broke into laughter. \"Promises I can keep.\"\n\nThe men's playful banter on \"Flagrant,\" which drew 1.9 million views, might not have seemed political, but in fact it was a subtextual kind of litmus test, birthed from a new media landscape, with very real political consequences.\n\nThat test, put in simple terms, is this: Can you hang with the boys?\n\nA year ago, President Trump seemed to hold his own when he, too, appeared on \"Flagrant,\" as well as on shows hosted by big names, like Theo Von and Mr. Rogan. The approach helped him draw young men away from Democrats by wide margin, into a winning coalition.\n\nMr. Mamdani forged a similar path through this nebulous online territory, where authenticity is a currency impossible to counterfeit.\n\nIt appears to have won him a foothold with young men over his opponents, Mr. Cuomo and the Republican nominee, Curtis Sliwa. A CNN exit poll showed Mr. Mamdani dominating the category, earning 65 percent of the votes by men 18 to 29.\n\nOver the course of his campaign, Mr. Mamdani made more than 30 appearances across the digital wilderness of podcasts, livestreams, and YouTube shows that have come to be the primary delivery mechanism of news and current events for Americans under the age of 30, -- and which Democrats have historically avoided.\n\n\"Places where people are used to hot takes and not politicians -- to show that Zohran was the kind of candidate who could talk about housing and Arsenal in the same breath\" said Zara Rahim, a special adviser to the Mamdani campaign who helped shape its new media strategy.\n\nNo podcast was deemed off limits. Mr. Mamdani had even agreed to appear on Joe Rogan's podcast, but scheduling conflicts got in the way, according to a spokesperson for the campaign.\n\nVenturing into the heart of masculinist online media was once considered more of a liability. When Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont appeared on Mr. Rogan's podcast in 2020, it reinforced for some his often derided \"Bernie Bro\" appeal, and many liberals were aghast when Mr. Sanders did not denounce Mr. Rogan's endorsement of him.\n\nOne presidential election cycle later, former Vice President Kamala Harris faced criticism for not appearing on Mr. Rogan's show. The decision became a hotly debated flashpoint in the post-mortems about the Democratic Party's struggles to reach young men and engage them in online spaces.\n\nThe fixes, proposed by party strategists, have hinged on minting a \"Joe Rogan of the left\" or building large-language models to study the vocal patterns of male speakers. Democrats have also prodded donors to chip in tens of millions of dollars to fund progressive-leaning creators and content incubators.\n\nSome prominent Democrats, like the former transportation secretary, Pete Buttigieg, and Representative Ro Khanna of California,have tiptoed into this fraught terrain. Gov. Gavin Newsom of California has gone as far as to start his own podcast, \"This Is Gavin Newsom,\" centered on tough conversations with conservative personalities.\n\nPlaying across the political spectrum, Mr. Mamdani dropped in on the center left -- chatting with Sam Seder on \"The Majority Report\" -- the center right -- on \"FYPod\" with Tim Miller -- and beyond, to the nihilistic, and sometimes crass and clubby boys zones staked out by the \"bros\" on the \"Flagrant\" podcast.\n\nHe also appeared on women-led shows, like \"I've Had It,\" hosted by Jennifer Welch and Angie Sullivan, and Katie Couric's podcast.\n\n\"He's figured out a way to banter with the boys and not punch down,\" Charlie Sabgir, research and strategy lead for the Young Men Research Project, a nonpartisan organization, said of Mr. Mamdani.\n\nBack in early April, Mr. Mamdani showed the leftist Twitch streamer Hasan Piker around his home neighborhood of Astoria, Queens. Sitting down at Yemeni coffee shops and popping by Bangladeshi restaurants, the two discussed the candidate's then-fledgling campaign for the better part of three hours while tens of thousands of Mr. Piker's viewers tuned in.\n\n\"Zohran's a good hang,\" Mr. Piker said in an interview. \"He's just a dude, and it's good to be a dude sometimes.\"\n\nHe added: \"And I think you can see that even when he talks with people who are his ideological opposites.\"\n\nMr. Mamdani also made an impression on James Harris, a co-host of the men's wear podcast \"Throwing Fits,\" with whom Mr. Mamdani recorded an episode after his first mayoral debate in June.\n\n\"It felt like this guy is who he is, this is what he believes in,\" Mr. Harris said, reflecting on Mr. Mamdani's tendency to return to his talking points. \"But he also wants to have a fun conversation and is down to clown.\"\n\nMr. Mamdani's podcast appearances have not been entirely without controversy. Onstage during last month's mayoral debate, Mr. Cuomo attacked Mr. Mamdani over his association with Mr. Piker, who had made provocative comments about Sept. 11. But the attacks failed to resonate with the young men tuning in to Mr. Mamdani's larger message.\n\nSucceeding in these online spaces, experts said, can be more complicated than playing the part of the cool politician, or simply making campaign stops in the manosphere.\n\nMr. Cuomo, for instance, also sat down with some of the loudest voices in the manosphere, appearing on Logan Paul's \"Impaulsive Podcast\" in the final weeks of the election.\n\nThe episode, to date, has just over 100,000 views, paltry by Mr. Paul's standards, and received a barrage of negative comments.\n\nMr. Sabgir contrasted Mr. Cuomo's method with Mr. Mamdani's, noting the latter's ability to put forward an \"optimistic\" and \"joyful\" message. Something, he thinks, Gen Z is looking for most.\n\n\"Young men are generally disenchanted with both parties,\" Mr. Sabigr said. \"But Mr. Mamdani tried to win them back, especially Trump voters, by running for something as opposed to against something.\"",

You can apply to attend here.\n\nHERE'S WHAT'S HAPPENING\n\nPresident Trump floats the prospect of a tariff \"dividend.\" Trump wrote on social media on Sunday that a payout would amount to at least $2,000, but that \"high income people\" would be excluded. Hours later, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent appeared to push back on the idea. Economists have warned that such moves could stoke inflation.\n\nBeijing suspends export controls on five critical minerals for a year. China's move eases the flow of the materials, which are crucial to manufacturing certain semiconductors, batteries and nuclear reactors. The resumption of the exports was a key concession in trade talks last month with U.S. officials.\n\nOpenAI argues for a tax break for data centers. In a recent open letter to the Trump administration, the artificial intelligence giant said the government should consider extending a tax credit intended for the U.S. semiconductor sector \"to accelerate the A.I. build\" in the country. But last week Sam Altman, OpenAI's C.E.O., said the company did \"not have or want government guarantees for OpenAI datacenters.\"\n\nThe task forces\n\nThe DealBook Summit will also feature a series of task force conversations with experts, stakeholders and leaders on topics shaping the world at large.\n\nWhile the task forces are not open to attendees, watch for a special section in The Times and tune in to the DealBook podcast in the days after the summit for coverage of the discussions.\n\nThis year's task forces include:\n\nThe Global Re-Order, moderated by Nicholas Kristof, Times Opinion columnist, and featuring:\n\n* Ehud Barak, former prime minister of Israel\n\n* Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware and member of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations\n\n* Mark Esper, former U.S. secretary of defense\n\n* Avril Haines, former U.S. director of national intelligence\n\n* David Petraeus, partner and chairman of the Global Institute; chairman of KKR Middle East Global Institute New York and former director of the C.I.A.\n\n* Fareed Zakaria, host of \"Fareed Zakaria GPS\" on CNN\n\nThe Education of Higher Education, moderated by Jodi Kantor, Times investigative reporter and featuring:\n\n* Carmen Twillie Ambar, president of Oberlin College and Conservatory\n\n* Sian Leah Beilock, president of Dartmouth College\n\n* Ron Daniels, president of Johns Hopkins University\n\n* Daniel Diermeier, chancellor of Vanderbilt University\n\n* James Harris, president of the University of San Diego\n\n* John King, chancellor of the State University of New York and former U.S. secretary of education\n\n* Jonathan Levin, president of Stanford University\n\nThe New Rules for Leadership, moderated by David Brooks, Times Opinion columnist, and featuring:\n\n* Alex Chriss, C.E.O. of PayPal\n\n* Beth Ford, C.E.O. of Land O'Lakes\n\n* Bob Jordan, C.E.O. of Southwest Airlines\n\n* Ynon Kreiz, chairman and C.E.O. of Mattel\n\n* Pete Nordstrom, co-C.E.O. of Nordstrom\n\n* Emma Walmsley, C.E.O. of GlaxoSmithKline\n\nJournalism, Interrupted, moderated by Michael Barbaro, Times journalist and co-host of \"The Daily,\" and featuring:\n\n* Charlamagne Tha God, co-host of \"The Breakfast Club\" and co-founder of The Black Effect\n\n* Jon Favreau, co-founder of Crooked Media and host of \"Pod Save America\"\n\n* Amna Nawaz, co-anchor and co-managing editor of PBS \"NewsHour\"\n\n* David Remnick, editor of The New Yorker and host of \"The New Yorker Radio Hour\"\n\n* Stephanie Ruhle, host of MSNBC's \"The 11th Hour With Stephanie Ruhle\"\n\n* Andrew Schulz, host of the podcasts \"The Brilliant Idiots\" and \"Flagrant\" with Akaash Singh\n\n* Ben Shapiro, co-founder of The Daily Wire and host of \"The Ben Shapiro Show\"\n\nThe groundbreakers\n\nThe summit will also feature innovators, newsmakers and trailblazers from the public and private sectors, who will each lead a table at a lunchtime discussion focused on the critical issues of the day.\n\nThis year's groundbreakers include:\n\n* Stacey Abrams, author, entrepreneur and political leader\n\n* Bill Anderson, C.E.O. of Bayer\n\n* Mark Barrocas, C.E.O. of SharkNinja\n\n* Halle Berry, founder of Respin, filmmaker and advocate\n\n* Mario Carbone, chef and co-founder of Major Food Group and Carbone Fine Food\n\n* James Carville, Democratic strategist\n\n* Steve Case, co-founder of AOL, chairman and C.E.O. of Revolution\n\n* Ron Chernow, author and historian\n\n* Ezekiel Emanuel, M.D., Ph.D., vice provost of Global Initiatives at the University of Pennsylvania\n\n* Jon Finer, former deputy U.S. national security adviser and co-host of \"The Long Game,\" a podcast\n\n* Amanda Gorman, presidential inaugural poet, activist and UNICEF supporter\n\n* Lucy Guo, founder and C.E.O. of Passes\n\n* Karine Jean-Pierre, author and former White House press secretary to Joe Biden\n\n* Ashley Judd, actor, author and humanitarian\n\n* Garry Kasparov, chairman of the Renew Democracy Initiative, Russian pro-democracy activist and former world chess champion\n\n* Paula Kerger, C.E.O. of PBS\n\n* Monica Lewinsky, activist, producer, podcast host, global speaker and contributing editor to Vanity Fair\n\n* J.

And other Democrats quickly criticized the deal as a concession on the central justification for the shutdown fight.\n\nThe latest: Eight senators in the Democratic caucus voted with Republicans to approve a measure that would fund most federal agencies through January. Key to its passage was a new provision that reverses the layoffs of federal workers during the shutdown and ensures that furloughed employees receive back pay.\n\nIt also includes a promise by Senator John Thune, the majority leader, to hold a vote on extending health insurance subsidies set to expire at the end of the year.\n\nDemocrats were unlikely to get a concession on the health care tax credits, Senator Angus King, the Maine independent who caucuses with Democrats, said about why he and other colleagues voted for the bill. He added that Democrats \"still have a chance\" of getting the credits reinstated via the promised vote, though it's considered improbable given Republican control of Congress.\n\n\"In the meantime, a lot of people are being hurt,\" he added.\n\nThat pain includes growing delays at U.S. airports, as federal restrictions on flying led to thousands of flights being canceled this past weekend. The F.A.A. is set to widen those limits by Friday, to at least 10 percent of flights from the current 4 percent. And restrictions on business jets and private planes at some major airports are set to take effect on Monday.\n\n\"It's only going to get worse,\" Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said on CNN on Sunday, adding that air travel would \"be reduced to a trickle\" leading into the busy Thanksgiving holiday.\n\nThe Trump administration also put more pressure on states over food-stamp services, threatening harsh financial penalties for any that didn't \"immediately undo\" steps to provide full benefits. (However, a federal appeals court in Boston late last night rejected the administration's effort to avoid paying full benefits.)\n\nWhen would the government reopen? The measure approved last night must still win approval by the full Senate, pass the House and be signed by President Trump.\n\nBut some progressive Democratic lawmakers and Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, have threatened to effectively delay consideration of the legislation by several days.\n\nExclusive: A.I. start-up Gamma secures a big fund-raising round\n\nVenture capitalists' appetite for artificial intelligence start-ups remains enormous: The field now accounts for nearly two-thirds of all venture deals in the U.S., according to PitchBook.\n\nThe latest example of that fervor is Gamma, a start-up seeking to build a PowerPoint for the A.I. era. The company plans to announce on Monday that it has raised $68 million in new financing, Niko Gallogly is first to report.\n\nThe new round values Gamma at $2.1 billion. The effort was led by Andreessen Horowitz, the big venture capital firm that is a new investor in the company. Accel, which led Gamma's previous fund-raising round early last year, also participated.\n\nGamma was founded in 2020 by Grant Lee and two other entrepreneurs who saw an opportunity to use artificial intelligence to let users quickly turn text into sleek presentations. Slide decks are \"the language of business,\" Lee told DealBook, but require too much time \"moving pixels\" around instead of focusing on substance.\n\nThe generative A.I. boom \"breathed new life\" into Gamma's business, by unlocking capabilities in image and text modeling, said Sarah Wang, the Andreessen Horowitz partner who led the deal. Gamma has been profitable since 2023, executives said, and employs just 52 full-time employees, up from 28 earlier this year.\n\nThe company has grown since its previous round, amassing about 70 million customers -- more than 600,000 of whom pay a subscription fee -- and collecting about $100 million in annual revenue.\n\nThe start-up will use proceeds from the round to continue building services for corporate users. (It recently began offering a business account.) Lee said Gamma would also invest in A.I. talent and invest more in its international business. About 80 percent of Gamma's users are outside of the United States.\n\nBut Gamma faces steep competition. Microsoft and Google are spending billions in A.I. to improve their product offerings. And upstarts including Beautiful.ai and Canva, offer similar products.\n\nTHE SPEED READ\n\nDeals\n\n* Pfizer won a bidding war with Novo Nordisk over Metsera, a developer of obesity treatments, with a sweetened $10 billion takeover offer.

        "description": "Veteran ICE officers know face coverings are a bad look. But they're not coming off anytime soon.\n\nA few days after President Donald Trump took office, I got an invitation from ICE officials to observe the administration's new \"surge operations\" in New York City. They told me to show up at 4 a.m. at the downtown federal building where the agency has its holding cells. Officers in body armor huddled in the basement parking garage, then headed to the Bronx in a caravan of unmarked cars.\n\nThe trip wasn't particularly remarkable. Over the next few hours, officers made just one arrest. ICE officials were flustered that morning because Kristi Noem, the Homeland Security secretary, had shown up to join them, along with a CBS News crew. Noem began posting videos about arresting \"dirtbags\" before the sun was up. ICE officials had always insisted to reporters that social-media posts or any mention of ongoing operations would blow their cover and put officers in danger. But Noem was new, and eager to look tough, and the officers I talked with mostly just laughed it off. By mid-morning, the ride-along was over.\n\nLooking back at the photos I took that day, one thing stands out. The ICE officers weren't wearing masks.\n\nThe face coverings and neck gaiters went up soon after. A mid-February viral video from York, Pennsylvania, showed five officers in masks hauling away a man who begs to call his wife. In March, ICE grabbed the Turkish graduate student Rumeysa Ozturk -- whose visa was revoked for co-writing an op-ed about Gaza -- and surveillance footage showed her surrounded by agents in plain clothes, some with hoods, who yanked up their masks as they dragged her away.\n\nAs Trump's deportation campaign escalated, the masks quickly turned officers and agents into a faceless, impersonal, undifferentiated goon squad. It's a look that has long been associated with authoritarian regimes and secret police, and the basic visual signifiers of American law enforcement -- criminals wear masks; cops show their faces -- were suddenly inverted. In videos of masked officers that have gone viral since then, it's often hard to tell who is speaking, let alone what agency they belong to. Some of the encounters are so rushed that they look like abductions, not conventional arrests, and activists have started calling the federal agents \"kidnappers.\"\n\nFace coverings are now a standard accessory for federal immigration enforcement, and a symbol of the mass-deportation campaign that is Trump's top domestic-policy initiative. Veteran ICE officials I spoke with view the use of masks as an unquestionably negative development. But most of them see an evil that is necessary.\n\nThe job, under Trump, has changed. Immigration enforcement has traditionally happened more quietly and administratively, in jails or at ICE check-in offices, where the work is more akin to case management. Trump officials ordered officers into the streets and pressured them to meet arrest quotas, while turning the job into a kind of public performance by bringing news cameras and the administration's own film crews to make Department of Homeland Security propaganda videos. Activist groups and protesters record everything too, trailing the agents and officers with cellphone cameras, berating them and broadcasting the ugliest moments. Every encounter carries the risk of a viral interaction and online infamy that could lead to doxxing or something worse.\n\nThe masks were a way for officers to opt out -- to wall off the political complexities of their work or, for some, the moral ones.\n\nRead: ICE's 'athletically allergic' recruits\n\n\"The excuse I have heard is, 'I signed up for this, my family didn't,'\" one ICE official wrote to me. They described colleagues who say they've been \"demonized\" by their relatives and neighbors, or who say their children have been taunted in elementary school. The official, who was not authorized to speak with reporters, sympathized with colleagues who wear masks, but acknowledged that masking has an insidious effect on police work.\n\n\"People tend to be worse when they can be or think they are anonymous,\" the official told me. \"You think about what you are doing and how you are doing it when you know a particular use of force can be tied to who did it.\"\n\nThe face coverings are not mandatory. Most federal agencies do not provide them, and not every officer and agent uses one. In February and March, when masks became more common, ICE leaders discussed whether to restrict their use, according to current and former ICE officials I spoke with. Some officers had grown accustomed to wearing masks and neck gaiters during the pandemic, and officials adopted a permissive approach to their use, leaving it to individual discretion. Officers typically remove the masks when they're speaking to one another away from the cameras, or performing other nonpublic duties, then pull them up once they're making an arrest or see that they're being filmed. \"It's part of their uniform now,\" another ICE official told me. \"It's second nature.\"\n\nNone of the dozen or so current and former officials I spoke with said they thought the masks would come off anytime soon. Not in the new era of online activism, facial recognition, and anonymous threats. Not with the Trump crackdown escalating and becoming more confrontational.\n\nTodd Lyons, ICE's acting director, told CBS News that he wasn't a \"proponent of the masks,\" but he would allow them if officers thought they would help \"keep themselves and their family safe.\" Noem said that the masks help officers protect themselves \"in dangerous situations,\" and that DHS agencies could set guidelines for their use. Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the department, told me in an email that federal law-enforcement officers are facing a rash of threats and assaults \"including terror attacks, cars being used as weapons, bounties to murder them placed on their heads.\"\n\n\"That is why our officers wear masks,\" McLaughlin wrote. \"Protecting their identity is one way to prevent bad actors from targeting their homes and threatening their families.\"\n\nIn September, three women were charged in California for following an ICE agent home and posting his address on Instagram. Two men in Georgia were indicted by a grand jury last month for threatening to harm an ICE agent in social-media posts that included images of the man and his spouse. And a Mexican man living illegally in Dallas was arrested on October 14 after offering $10,000 for killing ICE agents in posts on TikTok.\n\nBut sometimes, the masks are used as tools of intimidation. On Halloween, federal agents in Southern California were photographed heading out to make arrests wearing ghoul masks. When the news site L.A. Taco asked DHS about the costumes, McLaughlin sent a two-word response: \"Happy Halloween.\"\n\nRead: Trump loves ICE. Its workforce has never been so miserable.\n\nTo speed up immigration arrests and deportations, DHS has pulled in help from the FBI, U.S. Marshals, and other Department of Justice agencies -- and those federal agents have adopted masks, too. Natalie Baldassarre, a spokesperson for the department, did not respond to questions about department policies regarding face coverings and agency identifiers. \"Protecting the safety and security of our federal law enforcement officers ridding our country of dangerous illegal aliens will continue to be a top priority for this Administration,\" Baldassarre wrote in a one-sentence response. One ICE official told me that DOJ agents sent to help them seem even more eager to hide their faces. \"They mask up even more, because they don't love being out with us,\" he told me.\n\nSome of the National Guard forces sent by Trump to protect ICE officers and buildings cover their faces, but the troops patrolling Washington, D.C. -- and picking up litter -- generally don't wear them. The National Guard does not have a uniform policy governing masks, and a spokesperson for the Guard told me their use can be set by whichever state or federal authority is in charge of their deployment.\n\nThe masks, which DHS insists are a means of keeping officers safe, have also served as a rallying point for protest and a spur to confrontation. They \"immediately escalate things,\" another former ICE official told me, and reinforce an impression that agents and officers are ashamed of what they're doing. Officers and agents with faces covered have been confronted by local residents and protesters who denounce them as \"cowards\" for hiding their faces.\n\nIn Washington, Trump opponents have launched a street-art campaign, plastering the city with posters that say Take off your masks! and Why are you hiding your face? Public servants should face the public. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser has not opposed the National Guard troop deployment but has urged federal forces not to wear masks and to clearly identify themselves on city streets.\n\nDemocrats have introduced legislation that would bar federal agents from using masks during immigration arrests, but the efforts are mostly symbolic. \"The United States is not a dictatorship,\" Representative Dan Goldman, a New York Democrat who introduced the \"No Secret Police Act\" in June, said in a statement. He called his proposal \"commonsense legislation ensuring that our federal government's laws are enforced by identifiable human beings, not anonymous, secret agents of the state.\" California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed into law legislation with the same name. It's due to take effect January 1, but it's unclear how state authorities expect to enforce the law against federal agents and officers.\n\nThe legislation demands that federal agents and officers wear uniforms and insignia that clearly identify the agencies they work for. Many of the agents use ballistic vests with generic labeling that says Police or Federal Police. Others say ERO, which stands for Enforcement and Removal Operations -- the deportation arm of ICE -- but the acronym isn't well known to the public. Veteran officials I spoke with said the lack of clear labels isn't a deliberate attempt to evade responsibility. They offer a more humdrum explanation: bulk orders of protective gear made by different agencies, at different times, without a single standard.\n\nSome ICE officials I spoke with said they would welcome clearer identifiers because they resent being blamed for violent incidents involving U.S. Border Patrol agents. Trump's crackdowns in Los Angeles and Chicago have been led by Border Patrol Chief Gregory Bovino, and many of the viral arrest videos on social media have involved his forces, not ICE officers. The White House signaled a preference for Bovino's tactics last month when the administration started replacing even more ICE leaders at regional offices with Border Patrol commanders. In DHS social-media videos promoting Bovino's commando tactics, he is often the only Border Patrol figure without a mask, a visual effect that enhances his performative role in Trump's campaign.\n\nRead: The hype man of Trump's mass deportations\n\nBorder Patrol and ICE tend to have a different approach to immigration enforcement: ICE officers are used to working in U.S. cities and targeting specific individuals they're seeking to arrest. Border Patrol agents work in remote desert and mountain areas where they are trained to see anyone they encounter as a suspected illegal entrant. They don't hesitate to use force on suspects who run or resist arrest. But they've never been deployed to U.S. cities at this scale, hundreds of miles from any border crossing.\n\nJason Owens, who retired as Border Patrol chief in April, told me that he understands agents' decision to conceal their faces. \"I'm having a tough time blaming our folks when I see what the crowds and extremists have been capable of,\" Owens told me. He said agents keep patches with their badge numbers clearly visible on their uniforms, and do not use masks with skulls or other \"unprofessional markings.\"\n\nWhen I worked as a reporter in Mexico covering the drug war in the early 2010s, the police and soldiers often wore masks, while the criminals went around with their faces showing. The cartels would learn the identities of officers and soldiers, and try to corrupt them. If they refused to take bribes, they were targeted for assassination. This offer was called plata o plomo -- \"silver or lead.\" A bribe or a bullet.\n\nThose who did take the bribes and worked for the traffickers would continue doing so in their police or military uniforms, leaving no way for the public to tell who was who. It became safer to assume the cartels were everywhere. Trust in police, and public institutions more broadly, steadily eroded, allowing lawlessness -- or unaccountable, arbitrary assertions of state power -- to flourish.\n\nThe U.S. does not have a similar crisis of corruption in its law-enforcement agencies, but criminals in the United States have started using masks to impersonate federal officers, making it hard for ordinary citizens to know whether an armed masked man is there to enforce the law or to break it. There have been more cases of ICE impersonators this year than during the past four presidential administrations combined, according to CNN. In June, two masked men wearing vests that said ICE stopped a motorist and robbed him at gunpoint in Delaware. In August, a masked gunman robbed a grocery store in Colorado Springs after flashing a fake ICE badge. Masked men impersonating FBI agents robbed a home in Southern California last month.\n\nChuck Wexler, the executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum, which works with police agencies to promote best practices, said there has long been a divergence regarding transparency in the way state and local police departments operate compared with the feds. \"Why do police officers have their names on their uniforms, and their badge numbers? All of those things have evolved over time because police officers work in the community, and the community pays their salaries,\" Wexler told me. \"That is what trust and good policing look like.\"\n\nWhen officers are involved in a shooting or another use of force, these departments typically release the name of the officer as a matter of accountability, he added.\n\nFederal forces take orders from the White House, not the cities and communities where they're working. The masks, Wexler said, are partly the product of a wider trust gap brought about by Trump officials claiming to be targeting dangerous criminals -- \"the worst of the worst.\" Instead the public sees agents grabbing people not engaged in any obvious criminal activity: mothers walking children to school, landscapers coming home from work, families in the hallways of courthouses.\n\nWexler said police departments in some cities are getting 911 calls from community residents reporting the presence of armed masked men in their neighborhoods, hoping local officers can protect them. \"I think most people who live in those communities want the worst of the worst deported,\" Wexler told me. \"If ICE agents were arresting or deporting the worst of the worst, they probably wouldn't have to wear masks.\"",

        "title": "Senate takes a first big step to end government shutdown",
        "description": "Late Sunday, the Senate took the first in a series of votes that likely will lead to the government reopening later this week.\n\nWASHINGTON -- The Senate took a first big step Sunday night toward ending the longest-ever U.S. government shutdown amid mounting pressure for Congress to act as Americans cope with halted food stamps and canceled flights weeks before the holidays.\n\nOn Day 40 of the shutdown, the Senate voted 60-40 to advance a deal to reopen the government after a group of eight Senate Democrats relented from policy demands and broke from their party ranks to strike an an agreement with congressional Republicans.\n\nThe action puts the shutdown on track to potentially end this week, but a final vote is still required by the Senate and then the House before the continuing resolution heads to President Donald Trump's desk.\n\nThe deal negotiated by Republican leaders and the eight Democrats reverses federal layoffs, promises a vote in the future on expiring Obamacare subsidies, and fully reopens the government through Jan. 30.\n\nIt appears to be a turning point toward the end of the monthlong political crisis that has left millions of Americans unable to travel, afford food, or send their kids to preschool (among many other rapidly mounting consequences).\n\nYet drawing criticism from many Democrats inside and outside of Congress, the agreement does not guarantee the extension of the health care subsidies, which are set to expire at the end of the year and send health care premiums skyrocketing.\n\nFor weeks, Senate Democrats had stayed mostly unified and held off supporting a Republican-backed to reopen the government unless it also extended the subsidies.\n\nBut the group of Democratic defectors \u2012 which include four former governors and mostly moderates \u2012 argued it was time to end the shutdown after Republicans agreed to hold a vote on the Obamacare subsidies in December.\n\nNo further Senate votes expected tonight\n\nNo additional votes in the Senate are expected Sunday night. The chamber could send its funding package to end the shutdown over to the House of Representatives as soon as Monday (if not then, certainly in the coming days).\n\nAfter voting late into the evening, lawmakers started departing the Capitol before the Senate recessed until 11 a.m. Monday.\n\nDemocrats break with party to advance spending bill\n\nSenators late Sunday night cleared a procedural hurdle to begin the process of ending the shutdown.\n\nAlong with most other Republicans, seven Democrats and one independent senator (Maine's Angus King, who caucuses with the Democrats) voted to move toward advancing a funding agreement that could reopen the government as soon as this week.\n\nThe other Democrats who broke with their party were Sens. Catherine Cortez Masto and Jacky Rosen of Nevada, Maggie Hassan and Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, Dick Durbin of Illinois, Tim Kaine of Virginia and John Fetterman of Pennsylvania.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York, voted against the measure.\n\n10K+ flights delayed on third day of government-mandated cuts\n\nSunday's flight cancelations and delays were the single worst day for flight disruptions since the government shutdown began on Oct. 1.\n\nEarlier in the day, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy warned that air travel will only continue to get worse as airlines dealt with a third day of government-mandated flight cuts and air traffic control staffing shortages.\n\nThe FAA is 1,000 to 2,000 controllers short of full staffing, Duffy told CNN. The Federal Aviation Administration previously said it had staffing issues at 12 towers.\n\nBy late Sunday night, more than 10,000 flights within, into, or out of the United States had been delayed, according to FlightAware. Over 2,800 flights were canceled for the day. - Thao Nguyen\n\nDemocrat vs. Democrat on ACA subsidies\n\nThe eight Democratic defectors who joined Republicans to try to reopen the government are facing widespread criticism from within their party for supporting a deal that does not guarantee the extension of expiring health care subsidies.\n\nNew Jersey Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill, who was one of Democrats' biggest winners during last week's off-year elections, accused her Democratic colleagues in the Senate of \"caving on a bill that the American people can't afford.\"\n\n\"Make no mistake, if this bill passes, it will lead to New Jerseyans paying far more for their healthcare, when they are already paying more and more for everything,\" said Sherrill, who is currently a fourth-term New Jersey congresswoman. \"Making this deal is malpractice.\"\n\nFor weeks, Democrats have refused to reopen the government unless legislation also included the extension of subsides in the Affordable Care Act, which are set to expire at the end of the year and send premiums skyrocketing for millions of Americans.\n\nBut the deal reached with Republicans only ensures a vote later on extending the subsidies.\n\n\"Pathetic,\" California Gov. Gavin Newsom wrote in a one-word post on X.\n\nSeveral Democratic candidates for Senate in 2026 expressed their disapproval as well. \"This moment demands fighters, not folders,\" said James Talarico, a Democratic state representative in Texas who is running for U.S. Senate.\n\nRep. Ro Khanna, D-California, attacked the leadership of Democratic Senate Leader Chuck Schumer as he voiced his frustration - even though Schumer voted against the deal.\n\n\"Senator Schumer is no longer effective and should be replaced,\" Khanna said in a post on X. \"If you can't lead the fight to stop healthcare premiums from skyrocketing for Americans, what will you fight for?\"\n\nSen. Mark Warner, D-Virginia, in a statement, said he wants \"nothing more than to reopen the government, get folks back to work, and end the needless hardship this Republican shutdown is causing.\"\n\nBut he added: \"I cannot support a deal that still leaves millions of Americans wondering how they are going to pay for their health care or whether they will be able to afford to get sick.\"\n\nBy opposing the deal, Warner broke from his Virginia colleague in the Senate, Sen. Tim Kaine, who is among the eight Democratic defectors. - Joey Garrison\n\nKey dates to watch\n\n* This week: Proposals to reopen the government will start to work their way through both chambers of Congress.\n\n* Thanksgiving: Congressional leaders have indicated the shutdown will be over by the holiday. Sunday's agreement made that assertion much more likely.\n\n* Second week of December: The Senate will hold a vote on extending expiring Obamacare subsidies. It's unclear if such a measure would pass.\n\n* Jan. 30: The short-term funding measure lawmakers plan to pass this week would turn the government's lights back on until Jan. 30. If more full-year appropriations bills aren't passed by then, the government could shut down again, though only partially.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nNow that some Democrats have signaled new support for reopening the government, Congress has to clear a number of procedural hurdles.\n\nWhen the new funding deal passes the Senate, which could take several days, the bills will then have to pass the House of Representatives, which hasn't taken a vote in weeks. Lawmakers in the House have been on a 48-hour return notice, so it would likely take several days (barring any travel issues lawmakers might experience) for them to pass any Senate bills.\n\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune, R-South Dakota, indicated last week he didn't think the shutdown would last past Thanksgiving.\n\nWhat's in the deal?\n\nThe agreed-to deal would reopen the government until Jan. 30. It would also include full-year funding for several agencies and programs, including food aid and veterans' benefits. Funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, would continue through September at higher levels.\n\nAnother component of the agreement includes a commitment to a vote in the second week of December on a bill to potentially extend expiring Obamacare subsidies. The tax credits, which millions of Americans rely on for help paying premiums, have been the issue at the center of the shutdown fight.\n\nIn addition, the deal will reverse the layoffs of thousands of federal workers, while barring any potential firings until Jan. 30. The terminations have been temporarily barred by a federal court.\n\nShutdown pain has been growing\n\nPain connected to the shutdown has been steadily intensifying in recent weeks and days. Even Abigail Spanberger, the governor-elect in Virginia who swept to victory last week, said that her win shouldn't be viewed as an excuse to prolong the shutdown.\n\n\"Virginians need to - and Virginians want to - see the government reopen,\" she said Sunday on \"Face the Nation\" on CBS.\n\nOn Nov. 7, thousands of federal workers missed another paycheck. Hours later, the Supreme Court said the Trump administration didn't have to promptly pay full food assistance benefits.\n\nThen, on Nov. 9, thousands of flights were canceled or delayed. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy warned that unless the government reopens soon, flights could be reduced to a \"trickle\" ahead of Thanksgiving.\n\nAsked on CNN how many Americans could be separated from their families over the holiday due to air travel issues, Duffy said that \"the number's going to be substantial.\"",

        "description": "Maryland Gov. Wes Moore dismissed concerns from his state's Senate president over potential drawbacks to his redistricting efforts on \"Face the Nation.\"\n\nGov. Wes Moore, D-Md., dismissed concerns from Maryland Senate President Bill Ferguson, a fellow Democrat, over his new push to redraw the state's congressional map on Sunday.\n\nIn a letter last month, Ferguson urged his party to avoid pursuing mid-cycle redistricting measures to redraw Maryland's congressional lines, fearing that the process could backfire.\n\n\"I believe that mid-cycle redistricting in Maryland twists rules for potential short-term advantage while undermining trust in institutions and ultimately, democracy, but that is not the reason we should not pursue it,\" Ferguson wrote. \"Simply put, it is too risky and jeopardizes Maryland's ability to fight against the radical Trump Administration.\"\n\nNEWSOM-STYLE REDISTRICTING EFFORTS CRITIQUED BY CALIFORNIA DEMOCRATS AS RECENTLY AS JULY, STATEMENTS SHOW\n\nMoore told CBS' \"Face the Nation\" host Margaret Brennan that \"fighting for democracy is never risky\" and stood by his order to form a redistricting commission despite Ferguson's objections.\n\n\"My job is to make sure that I'm protecting the democratic process,\" Moore said. \"The Senate President and I, we agree on the crisis that Donald Trump has put us in. He agrees on the fact that we have watched an administration that's using the Constitution like it's a suggestion box.\"\n\n\"Where we differ is the urgency that this moment requires, the fight that this moment requires,\" he continued. \"And I personally am someone who is not going to allow Donald Trump to determine whether or not Maryland follows this idea of saying, are we going to do everything we can to make sure we're preserving our democracy.\"\n\nFORMER DEMOCRATIC ADVISOR SAYS PARTY'S RHETORIC ON REDISTRICTING IS GETTING 'A LITTLE OUT OF CONTROL'\n\nBrennan pressed Moore over whether he considered redistricting efforts in Maryland to be \"fair,\" noting that Maryland has only one Republican representative. Moore insisted that he would not be drawing the maps and only wants a bipartisan commission to balance out redistricting efforts in other states.\n\n\"I want this bipartisan commission to be able to actually speak with the people and to be able to go through their process and just simply say that if other states are going to go through this process, that we're not just going to sit on our hands because Donald Trump tells us to,\" Moore said. \"That's not the way this process is going to work.\"\n\nFox News Digital reached out to Ferguson for comment.\n\nLONE MARYLAND GOP CONGRESSMAN WARNS REDISTRICTING COULD CUT WHITE HOUSE TIES FOR ENTIRE STATE\n\nMoore is not the only blue state leader attempting to redraw congressional districts.

        "title": "ICE received more than 200K job applications since Trump admin...",
        "description": "Immigration and Customs Enforcement have received more than 200,000 job applications since President Trump launched its new crackdown on illegal immigration, officials said.\n\nThat includes a surge in applications since the government shutdown started at the end of September, according to a Friday announcement.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced that upwards of 200,000 \"patriotic Americans\" had submitted applications to join ICE.\n\n\"ICE has received more than 200,000 applications from patriotic Americans who want to defend the homeland by removing the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens from the U.S. Americans are answering their country's call to serve and help remove murderers, pedophiles, rapists, terrorists, and gang members from our country,\" Noem said in a statement.\n\nIn mid-September, exactly two weeks before the government shutdown started, Noem boasted that the agency had received approximately 150,000 applications and extended 18,000 tentative offers.\n\nIn August, Noem also announced that the federal government would eliminate the age cap so that anyone could apply to be an ICE agent.\n\nThe leaders of each city and state, including Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker and California Gov. Gavin Newsom, were quick to push back against the Trump administration and repeatedly called on the agents to vacate.\n\nTo compensate, DHS offers its top recruits an enticing jackpot of benefits, including a maximum $50,000 signing bonus and even six-figure salaries.\n\nWhile many government workers were furloughed or pushed to work without pay during the government shutdown, ICE agents received a \"super check\" including \"4 days loss, their overtime, and their next pay period\" which drew from the copious funds provided by Trump's Big Beautiful Bill, Noem said on X.\n\nThe megabill, which was ratified in early July, provided the agency with $75 billion in extra funding, with $30 million set aside for arrest and deportation efforts and the rest dedicated to expanding detention capabilities.\n\nDHS also revamped its advertising for ICE and started to lean more heavily on pop culture, including bizarre edits of raids dubbed over with popular songs -- which many of the artists and companies didn't approve of.\n\nSome other advertisements include modernized propaganda used during wars to encourage civilian enlistment in the military, including ones featuring the infamous Uncle Sam, a fictional personification of the US.",

        "title": "Ten seconds in the Oval Office that overshadowed Trump's drug-price win",
        "description": "President Donald Trump in the Oval Office with Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. during an event with pharmaceutical companies Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk on Thursday November. (Matt McClain/The Washington Post)\n\nA man's dramatic collapse in the Oval Office last week and Trump officials' reactions grabbed public attention, inspired \"Saturday Night Live\" and fueled internet conspiracy theories -- with the fallout overshadowing the intended focus of Thursday's White House event on new price cuts for weight-loss drugs.\n\nImages of Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. appearing to leave as the man was in crisis, and President Donald Trump staring straight ahead as the chaotic scene unfolded behind him, were dissected on cable news segments this weekend and amplified by critics of the president. But they do not tell the complete story of a policy-laden event disrupted by a medical emergency, and some of the commentary has been inaccurate.\n\nThe man who collapsed was not a pharmaceutical executive, as \"Saturday Night Live\" and others have alleged, but a patient who had taken one of the companies' weight-loss drugs. Kennedy, by all accounts, was going to get help. And the photo of Trump staring straight ahead captured a brief moment after the president rose from his chair and pivoted to see others administer aid; he looked away as White House officials ushered everyone from the room.\n\nWhite House officials have spent days offering their own version of events and have protested depictions of Trump and his aides as uncaring.\n\n\"The Secretary rushed to get medical assistance while others tended to the man, you ghoul,\" Kush Desai, a White House spokesman, posted on social media, rebuking one prominent X user who claimed that Kennedy was trying to leave the room \"as quickly as possible.\"\n\nMehmet Oz, a physician who serves as a top Trump deputy, immediately stepped in to help the man and cared for him until White House medical personnel arrived. The man swiftly recovered, officials said.\n\nThe Oval Office event has drawn scrutiny for other reasons: Trump was caught on camera appearing to fend off sleep for nearly 20 minutes, a Washington Post analysis found. California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) dubbed Trump \"The Nodfather\" online, mocking the president's seeming struggle to stake awake during the presentation on GLP-1 price cuts. The White House has denied that Trump was dozing off and suggested questions about the matter were inappropriate.\n\nBut with public attention focused firmly on the spectacle, the administration has struggled to keep attention on an underlying policy achievement widely heralded as progress by public health experts. And the news conference -- split into two segments, interrupted by the man's 10-second collapse and the resulting fallout -- has been mostly unhelpful for the White House.\n\nAhead of Thursday, administration officials had initially hoped the drug-price event would draw mass attention, promising that their upcoming announcement would be \"historic.\" The event was part of their campaign to pressure pharmaceutical companies to cut their prices -- with Trump demanding near-weekly announcements of every concession by the industry.\n\nOfficials were thrilled to tout this as their biggest win yet: a deal with two companies to lower the price of popular weight-loss drugs and expand Medicare access to them.\n\n\"It was truly the single most significant announcement relating to drugs, drug pricing in the history of our country,\" Medicare official Chris Klomp said on the Fox Business channel.\n\nOutside experts have not gone that far, but credited Trump's move as a potential tactic to curb the nation's obesity epidemic and cut health spending. Some Democrats have offered grudging praise.\n\nBut visuals of the event have distracted attention from its purpose.\n\nBoth pharmaceutical firms, Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly, were allowed to have two representatives standing behind the president, shoulder-to-shoulder with senior Trump officials in the Oval Office.\n\nAnd it was one of those guests -- a man in his 60s, invited by Eli Lilly because of his experience taking their GLP-1 drugs, according to three people who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe a sensitive situation -- whose collapse, about 30 minutes into the news conference, precipitated a chaotic scramble that has since shaped the news cycle.\n\nMultiple news reports wrongly identified the man as a Novo Nordisk executive, with many prominent social media users basing their conclusion on a LinkedIn headshot. Some accounts and news outlets have yet to retract the false information, which continues to spread.\n\nMuch of the cable-news coverage focused on Trump's own actions. The president's behavior as the man collapsed was abhorrent, said Lawrence O'Donnell, an MSNBC host who devoted a 17-minute segment on his show to analyzing the moment.\n\n\"This image captured Donald Trump's ability to completely ignore a person in need,\" O'Donnell said on his Thursday night broadcast, comparing Trump to past presidents that he said would have rushed to help.\n\nFellow MSNBC hosts, CBS late-night host Stephen Colbert and other TV personalities and online pundits have also discussed the Oval Office emergency and circulated the images of Trump and his aides on their platforms -- mostly jibing at the White House. The scene was parodied three times on \"Saturday Night Live,\" including in a four-minute segment to start the show that suggested the collapsing man was a medical professional who nearly died \"at the mere thought of charging less for drugs.\"\n\n\"I think I'm playing this very normal: Just stand there and stare like a sociopath,\" comedian James Austin Johnson, in the role of Trump, told viewers. \"Didn't even pretend like I was gonna help.\"\n\nOz, Trump's deputy, has countered that the president personally sought to reassure the man's anxious wife after reporters left.\n\n\"He said, 'Give me that phone,' and he talked to her and got her much calmer than I could've done,\" Oz said in a video clip shared by the administration. \"He's just a wonderful human being that he would take time.\"\n\nThe White House has excised the frantic scene from its own channels, removing the original video with the medical emergency and replacing it with a version that elides the moment.",

        "description": "Caroline Linton is an associate managing editor on the political team for CBSNews.com. She has previously written for The Daily Beast, Newsweek and amNewYork.\n\nMaryland Gov. Wes Moore on Sunday defended the creation of a redistricting committee to edge out the single Republican-held seat in his state, saying he's \"not sure why we should be playing by a different set of rules than Texas, or than Florida, or than Ohio or all these other places.\"\n\n\"I want this bipartisan commission to be able to actually speak with the people and to be able to go through their process and just simply say that if other states are going to go through this process, that we're not just going to sit on our hands because Donald Trump tells us to,\" Moore said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan. \"That's not the way this process is going to work.\"\n\nLast week, Moore announced he had formed a commission to explore mid-decade redistricting in the state, following the lead of President Trump's push to redraw districts in GOP-led states Texas, Missouri and North Carolina to net more seats for Republicans.\n\nWhile Democrats initially decried Mr. Trump's efforts as an attempt to create an unfair advantage for Republicans, California's Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom pushed a ballot measure to redraw the state's congressional districts to gain up to five seats for Democrats. The measure, known as Prop 50, passed Tuesday with more than 60% of the vote, and an energized Newsom held a rally in Houston on Saturday, where he said Texas had \"woke us up.\"\n\nEight of Maryland's nine House seats are already occupied by Democrats, a state former Vice President Kamala Harris won by more than 28 points in 2024. A redistricting effort would target the single Republican-held seat in the eastern part of the state.\n\nMaryland's commission is chaired by U.S. Sen. Angela Alsobrooks, a close ally of Moore's, and is comprised of Senate President Bill Ferguson, Maryland House Speaker Adrienne A. Jones, former Attorney General Brian Frosh and Cumberland Mayor Raymond Morriss.\n\nFerguson, a Democrat, has opposed the redistricting effort, writing in a letter last month that \"mid-cycle redistricting for Maryland presents a reality where the legal risks are too high, the timeline for action is dangerous, the downside risk to Democrats is catastrophic, and the certainty of our existing map would be undermined.\"\n\nFerguson said last week the Democrats' election victories \"shows we don't need to rig the system to win.\"\n\nBut Moore insisted Sunday that \"fighting for democracy is never risky.\" He noted that he and Ferguson agree that there is a \"crisis that Donald Trump has put us in.\"\n\n\"Where we differ is the urgency that this moment requires, the fight that this moment requires,\" Moore said. \"And I personally am someone who is not going to allow Donald Trump to determine whether or not Maryland follows this idea of saying, are we going to do everything we can to make sure we're preserving our democracy.\"",

        "description": "Jim Treacher, a prolific blogger, posted one of the best comments after the Democratic blowout win last week in the off-year elections. \"I watched 'Escape from New York' instead of the election results,\" he posted on Substack. \"Because I figured, 'Well, I'll watch the actual result of this election.'\"\n\nHe was referencing New York's mayoral race, in which Islamic socialist Zohran Mamdani won. The perpetually grinning 34-year-old wunderkind immediately promised to facilitate his collectivist plans.\n\nThese include a rent freeze, government-owned grocery stores (like in communist Cuba), \"free\" public transit, \"free\" child care, a \"tax on millionaires\" and other ways to turn America's biggest city into a socialist hellhole.\n\nBefore long, New Yorkers may well be crying out for help from \"Snake Plissken.\" He is the antihero played by Kurt Russell in the 1981 dystopian John Carpenter movie mentioned by Mr. Treacher. Plissken is a war vet turned criminal who is blackmailed into rescuing the president of the United States, whose plane has crashed into New York City. Crime is so bad in the city that the government has sealed it off from the rest of the country.\n\nThe film deserves its R rating for violence and a torrent of profanity.\n\nGetting back to the election, I don't think \"blowout\" is adequate to describe the breadth of the Democratic sweep across the country. They won pretty much everything on every ballot.\n\nBy keeping the federal shutdown going, Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer, New York Democrat, ensured plenty of pain, especially in Northern Virginia's Washington suburbs. Democrats could have ended it by approving one of the 14 funding bills passed by the House, but they correctly calculated that their media would blame it on Republicans -- as usual.\n\nWhile Mr. Schumer smirked for cameras, I thought of this passage from Psalm 37: \"Do not fret because of him who prospers in his way, because of the man who brings wicked schemes to pass. Cease from anger and forsake wrath; Do not fret -- it only causes harm.\"\n\nOK, no fretting allowed, even though voters approved California Gov. Gavin Newsom's gerrymandering plan, elected liberal Democrats as governor in New Jersey and Virginia, along with Virginia's two other statewide offices, and added at least 10 state House seats in Virginia, giving them a supermajority.\n\nDemocrats will have total power in Richmond. The last time they got it, they initiated a far-left agenda in 2020. This included gun control laws, eliminating voter ID, expanding voter rights for felons, adding sexual orientation and gender identity to anti-discrimination laws, banning counseling for gender-confused minors, and legalizing marijuana and sports betting.\n\nThis time, they aim to gerrymander congressional districts and pass constitutional amendments enshrining abortion and same-sex marriage. So, buckle up, Old Dominion.\n\nVirginians had given Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin an overall high approval rate. Yet Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears lost the governor's race badly to faux centrist Democrat Abigail Spanberger. Attorney General Jason Miyares lost to Jay Jones, whose surfaced texts showed him dreaming of killing a former Republican House speaker and his children.\n\nPundits sum it up in one word: Trump. Yet there's more to it. President Trump elicits strong emotions because of his pugnacious personality. He knows the left will try to destroy him no matter how nice he is. (Think of Mitt Romney.) Mr. Trump also picks a lot of unnecessary fights. Does the leader of the free world really have to weigh in on Sydney Sweeney's jeans ads?\n\nYou can't underestimate the power of the media to undercut Mr. Trump's considerable accomplishments. For example, most Americans support his securing the border, ensuring renewal of the 2017 tax cuts and his bold move to bomb Iran's nuclear weapons facilities. These are now ancient history. Gas prices and inflation, driven up during the Biden administration, have fallen, but not by enough. The jury is still out on the effect of his tariffs.\n\nMr. Trump's various peace initiatives in the Gaza Strip and elsewhere may net him a Nobel Prize, but they don't ease the economic crunch facing many American families. He has been back in office for only 10 months, but Democrats and their media are hammering him for not cleaning up the mess they left fast enough.\n\nThere's also the perception of overreach. It's one thing to see criminal illegal aliens arrested and another to see footage of masked federal agents accosting mothers, fathers and children. As with the abortion issue, the media play up hard cases and ignore the overall reality. It's sad but no surprise that Virginia's female voters went for pro-abortion Ms. Spanberger by 59% to 38% for pro-life Ms. Earle-Sears.\n\nSome pundits have already written off Republicans in the 2026 midterms, but a lot can happen between now and then. Democrats are riven between their insurgent Marxist wing and what's left of their moderates. Republicans are narrowing the party registration gap in key states such as Pennsylvania and are raising more money than the Democrats.\n\nDemocrats are justifiably giddy right now, but the stark reality of a Mamdani-run New York may well reignite enthusiasm among Republicans and independents.\n\nThe game isn't over. Few political losses or victories are permanent, and Democrats are quite capable of blowing it again.\n\nFor conservative Virginians, it's going to be a tough couple of years. For New Yorkers -- and the rest of the country -- let's pray that it won't take the likes of Snake Plissken to turn things around.",

        "title": "Full transcript of \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan,\" Nov. 9, 2025",
        "description": "On this \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" broadcast, moderated by Margaret Brennan:\n\nClick here to browse full transcripts from 2025 of \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I'm Margaret Brennan in Washington.\n\nAnd this week on Face the Nation: the longest government shutdown in history, and no end in sight. With each passing day, the impact of the government shutdown grows, with millions of Americans now facing major disruptions, from mass flight cancellations and delays because of staffing shortages to growing lines at food banks, as the Supreme Court lets the Trump administration withhold some money to fund food stamp benefits.\n\nGOVERNOR JOSH SHAPIRO (D-Pennsylvania): When I see hungry people in my state who are hungry because of J.D. Vance's bull (EXPLETIVE DELETED) politics, that makes me angry.\n\nSENATOR JOHN THUNE (R-South Dakota): Isn't that what you all have been saying? It's about leverage? This isn't leverage. This is the lives of the American people.\n\n(End VT)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We will talk with Maryland's Democratic Governor Wes Moore and West Virginia's Republican Governor Patrick Morrisey about how they could fill the funding gap as safety net programs hang in limbo.\n\nThe president's top economic adviser, Kevin Hassett, will also join us. We will ask him what kind of impact this shutdown is having on our economy.\n\nDONALD TRUMP (President of the United States): The whole series of pricing and costs, the groceries and everything else, it was a con job. It was a con job. Affordability, they call it. It was a con job by the Democrats.\n\n(End VT)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Where the president sees a con job, Democrats see a winning message in last week's elections. We will hear from two incoming governors, Abigail Spanberger of Virginia and Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey.\n\nThe Senate is in session today, a rare weekend workday for lawmakers, but there is still no deal to reopen the government.\n\nWe begin this morning with the director of the White House National Economic Council, Kevin Hassett.\n\nThis is now the longest shutdown in American history. The treasury secretary told us two weeks ago November 15 was the hard stop for any paychecks going to U.S. troops. Does that remain the point of exhaustion?\n\nKEVIN HASSETT (Director, National Economic Council): Right. I think that that's about the right number.\n\nAnd the problem is that, under the law, we're not allowed to spend money that hasn't been appropriated. And there is a law, the Antideficiency Act, that says that, if a government official spends money that isn't appropriated by Congress, which will only happen if the Democrats vote to open up the government, then you could even have criminal penalties.\n\nAnd so people are very carefully studying the law and trying to get as much money out the door as is legal. And we're very glad that we found a way to get a lot of the SNAP money out, but it's really, really pushing the boundaries of the law, which is why the Supreme Court had to take that ruling from Rhode Island and put it on hold.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Until the lower court rules.\n\nKEVIN HASSETT: Until the lower court goes back and comes up with a legal justification for what they said, because there probably isn't one, sadly, which is why we have to get this government open.\n\nI mean, the fact is, Goldman Sachs, they have a top economic team, and they're estimating that we've already knocked about 1.5 percent off of GDP. I think that number is probably low if we keep going even a couple more weeks, because there's going to be a massive amount of air disruption, especially around the holidays.\n\nAnd one of these things - every now and then, when we're talking economics, you and I, we talk about seasonal adjustments and things like that. But the fact is that Thanksgiving - that Thanksgiving time is one of the hottest times of the year for the economy. It's Black Friday, you know, and all that kind of stuff.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\n\nKEVIN HASSETT: And if people aren't traveling at that moment, then we really could be looking at a negative quarter for the fourth quarter.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Which is significantly disruptive to the president's agenda.\n\nBut to the point you were just making about food stamps - and we saw this Friday, a temporary stay by the Supreme Court that would block full food stamp benefits pending the lower court decision. The administration's argument, as you just referenced there, was that it would be illegal to move around funding and to tap the Section 32 account at the USDA.\n\nBut why not do this as a short-term patchwork solution? Because you have found ways with the military pay to stretch things out. Why prioritize in that case and not do so with food?\n\nKEVIN HASSETT: Well, the president's job and all of our jobs is to uphold the law.\n\nAnd when - I'm not a lawyer, but when the lawyers tell us...\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: ... that wasn't done with the military.\n\nKEVIN HASSETT: But - but - but, yes, I think that the military is different because of the commander in chief stuff.\n\nBut the legal analysis suggests that we're doing everything by the book and then stretching things as much as we can, and basically trying to keep people from committing crimes, which, you know, you know about - in the season of lawfare, if you are a Cabinet secretary and you spend money that's not appropriated for that purpose in your Cabinet, then they can come back and they can take you to court.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But you're also making a political bet that Democrats aren't going to challenge paying the military. Do you really think Democrats would challenge and take to court paying people for their food stamp benefits...\n\nKEVIN HASSETT: Let's just say that we've seen Democrats take...\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: ... if - if Congress is going to fund it, when the shutdown ends?\n\nKEVIN HASSETT: We've seen Democrats take to court people that - on really, really poor, poor charges, and so I think they're likely to do anything.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well, it seems a political calculation is the point.\n\nKEVIN HASSETT: Well, we - we don't have a political calculation. Our calculation is to get the government open, to get the food stamps to people, and to get people to be paid; 750,000 government workers aren't getting paid right now.\n\nI know you're talking to the governor of Maryland in a minute. I'm sure his people are really hurting. Let's just get the government open, and then let's talk about things like the health care premiums, but do that through regular order.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well - so, it sounds like you are saying the position is the same, open the government, then we'll talk about health care.\n\nBut the president, just in the past 36 hours, has put out a number of social media posts. It sounds sort of like he's proposing something in regard to health insurance payments. He said: \"I'm recommending to Senate Republicans that hundreds of billions of dollars currently being sent to money-sucking insurance companies to save bad health care provided by Obamacare now be sent to the people so they can purchase their own, much better health care.\"\n\nHe also said they should terminate Obamacare. What does this alternative system look like? Because the entire standoff is about health care right now.\n\nKEVIN HASSETT: Right. Well, the president is, you know, a beautiful tactician, a beautiful negotiator.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: This is an offer?\n\nKEVIN HASSETT: And what he - this is - you know, what he said, he's brainstorming and trying to help the Senate come up with a deal that can get the government open.\n\nAnd one of the things you could do is, conservatives believe that they don't want the government to micromanage people's lives. And, you know, everybody believes that people should have health care, and so why not take the people who have higher health care premiums and just mail them a check and let them decide?\n\nThe reason why it could have an effect is that there are multiple tiers under the Affordable Care Act of different types of insurance. And it could be that people would rather have the money and go from, like, you know, this kind of plan to that kind of plan and save themselves a little bit.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Is this the...\n\nKEVIN HASSETT: And so that's - that's, you know, basically giving the people an opportunity to make more choices than the government usually lets them.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Is this the Senator Cassidy proposal?\n\nKEVIN HASSETT: I'm sure that Senator Cassidy and President Trump talked about it, but whether he agrees with everything that Cassidy - I haven't talked to him about it yet.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well, does the Republican leader in the Senate accept...\n\nKEVIN HASSETT: The president has - started this idea yesterday. I don't think that it's been discussed widely in the Senate yet.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: The Senate's in session this weekend.\n\nKEVIN HASSETT: Yes, the Senate is in session this weekend. And we are...\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Because they're trying to end the shutdown.\n\nKEVIN HASSETT: And here I am.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But this is not the Republican Party's position?\n\nKEVIN HASSETT: Current - as of right now, it's not the Senate position, but the president thought it was something they should think about.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well, he seems to be negotiating before the government's open.\n\nKEVIN HASSETT: He's talking to his colleagues in the Senate on the Republican side.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But you would agree that there does need to be a deal on health care, that health care costs are too high?\n\nKEVIN HASSETT: Well, I think that, if you look at the Affordable Care Act, these premiums weren't made permanent by the Democrats during the COVID emergency because they were worried about the budgetary costs.\n\nAnd so if you look at the premium increases, they don't affect most people below two times the poverty line, three times the poverty line. But there are a lot of senior citizens that are above, like, around four times the poverty level, which with a husband and wife team, would be about $120,000, that are seeing really big premium increases.\n\nAnd I think that everybody's going to want to think about what the next step for that would be, because are seeing - again, most people aren't seeing much of an increase at all, but the maximum increases you're seeing could be up to about $500 a month for seniors who have really costly plans.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: The president has also been talking about affordability.\n\nAnd our CBS polling shows the president's approval rating on the economy has dipped to 38 percent, the lowest of this term; 75 percent of those polled say he's not focusing enough on lowering prices.\n\nBut the president said this week Democrats are making it up and - quote - \"Every price is down.\"\n\nI'm sure you know the Consumer Price Index showed grocery prices are up nearly 3 percent in September from a year ago.\n\nKEVIN HASSETT: Well, but let's go through - let's go through the facts.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Do you dispute that?\n\nKEVIN HASSETT: Well, let - actually, yes, let's go through the facts, right?\n\nSo, inflation went up about 5 percent under President Biden. In President Trump's first eight or nine months, depending where we get the last number, it's up 2.7 percent. One of the big things that's hurting affordability is mortgages. The interest rate went up by about 4 percent.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: This is grocery prices.\n\nKEVIN HASSETT: No, grocery prices are actually down significantly under Trump. But here's the thing...\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well, it depends on which item.\n\nKEVIN HASSETT: No, let me - I will just make a point, that if you look at the real reduction in spending power for Americans under Joe Biden, then it went down about $3,000, because we had up to 9 percent inflation, and then they went to the grocery store, they couldn't buy the things they're used to buying.\n\nThe real spending power adjusted for inflation under President Trump has gone up about $1,200 so far this year; $1,200 is not $3,000. And so people are right to feel stretched, but we're making progress. And if you look at all the things, the positive things, about the economy, industrial production just about at an all-time high, capital spending about at an all-time high...\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\n\nKEVIN HASSETT: ... GDP growth right now about 4 percent, then that shows that the income growth that we need to get more affordability is on the path to happening.\n\nAnd the bottom line is that the last Consumer Price Index surprised down. It was lower than expected. And it was actually - would have been even lower, because there was a refinery shutdown that caused it to go slightly higher. So we see inflation under control and the economy booming.\n\nBut we understand 100 percent why people are still hurting, because we haven't made up all the room that was lost under Joe Biden.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So are you comfortable with 3 percent inflation?\n\nKEVIN HASSETT: I'm comfortable with 2 percent inflation.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So, no, you're not happy where things are now?\n\nKEVIN HASSETT: I think - well, they have got to go down a little bit more, but there - but the point is that inflation is like the Queen Mary, my friend Alan Greenspan used to say.\n\nSo when you go from almost 4 percent that we had in January...\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nKEVIN HASSETT: ... down to the mid 2's, then that's a trajectory that usually has momentum.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So, the St. Louis Fed found tariffs account for half-a- percentage point of the annual inflation rate. How much do you think the tariffs are hiking prices?\n\nKEVIN HASSETT: You know, there's a couple of papers out there that say that prices went up by between two-tenths and five-tenths.\n\nAnd the thing to remember, if those papers are true, is that that's a level adjust, because the tariff goes in, and then the tariff is just there, so it doesn't affect inflation in the future. So, it would be a one-time level adjust.\n\nOur estimates at CEA are much closer to zero, and it's all based on modeling and assumptions about elasticities and things. But for the most part, the one way you can see it is, you could look at the price of imported goods, and the price of imported goods, CEA put a report out, has actually been declining under tariffs, because what happens is that the Chinese want to sell us lots of stuff.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nKEVIN HASSETT: And there's a tariff, and so they cut their prices so that they can still have a larger market share in the U.S.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Kevin Hassett, always good to have you here in person.\n\nKEVIN HASSETT: Great to be here, of course. Thanks.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We have to leave it there for now.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We're joined now by the Democratic governor of Maryland, Wes Moore.\n\nGood to have you here in person.\n\nGOVERNOR WES MOORE (D-Maryland): Great to be with you. Thank you.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So, Governor, one in eight Americans use food stamps. In Maryland, you have about 700,000 people, as I understand it, who rely on this for food aid.\n\nSince the Supreme Court put that stay in place on Friday, do you know whether that money will actually be available to residents in your state to buy food?\n\nGOVERNOR WES MOORE: We don't know, and that's why we're not waiting.\n\nIt is why, just in the past few days, I have authorized over $10 million that's going towards heating assistance for people in the state of Maryland. Over $10 million has gone to our Maryland food banks, that we have made public transportation free for all of our federal workers, because they, in many cases, are going to work and not being paid.\n\nAnd I have also authorized $62 million to go towards SNAP to make sure that SNAP is not going to be interrupted for the people of Maryland for as long as we can, despite the fact that we are waiting for the president of the United States to finally do his job.\n\nWe are watching the president who is literally breaking the law so people can starve, but we're not going to sit there and tolerate in our state.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you just heard Director Hassett say that they are trying to follow the law, which is why they went to the courts.\n\nThe USDA did say they were going to work towards implementing full payments, and then there was this Supreme Court stay put in place. So, do you have clarity on when money might be coming through at all? Like, what's the federal government telling you?\n\nGOVERNOR WES MOORE: There is no clarity - clarity at all.\n\nIn the past - in the past six days, we've received four different measures of guidance from the USDA and from the Trump administration about how to handle it, where, initially, it was said, well, listen, we want the states to help to support, and despite the fact that this program was built as a partnership between the federal government and the states, where the federal government were really helping to underwrite these costs for people.\n\nAnd then once we decided to step up and say, we are going to make sure that our people are going to be OK, we have now...\n\nGOVERNOR WES MOORE: That we are going to front the money.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: OK.\n\nGOVERNOR WES MOORE: We've now received guidance saying the states are going to be punished for fronting the money.\n\nThere is a chaos, and it is an intentional chaos, that we are seeing from this administration, and where they have money for everything. They got money to fight wars. They got money for ballrooms. They got money for everything.\n\nBut when it comes to supporting the American people, that's now when they are crying, well, we're broke, and that's not what the law requires us to do.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: As you know, the White House says those - those sponsorships for the ballroom are separate from government money.\n\nGOVERNOR WES MOORE: Yes.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But on - on the issue, though, of the shutdown itself, on Friday, we did see the Democratic leader, Schumer, offer to end it if Republicans agree to a one-year extension of the Obamacare health care subsidies.\n\nRepublicans said that's a - that's a nonstarter. This is going to make - this is a big issue for the midterms. But would you - would you tell the Democrats on Capitol Hill to dig in, that the pain that the people who are living in your state is somehow going to be worth it in the end for an extension of a tax credit?\n\nGOVERNOR WES MOORE: There is no pain that is worth it. Our people are hurting, and they're hurting because of these games that we continue to see from Washington, D.C.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But would you tell Democrats, just take the vote, open the government, then keep negotiating health care?\n\nGOVERNOR WES MOORE: I want the government reopened now. There is no state that is dealing with more of an impact from this than the state of Maryland.\n\nWe have over 260,000 federal workers within our state, that, even before the shutdown, Donald Trump had fired over 15,000 Maryland workers, federal workers, more than any other state in this country.\n\nBut I also know that saying that a prerequisite for having the federal government open shouldn't be kicking up premiums by 90 percent, by kicking people off of health care. There's a bar - there's a - there's a - there's a barbaric nature to this ask and this request, particularly when we're watching how the Trump - you know, the Trump administration, they have the White House, the House and the Senate.\n\nThey can get this deal done by just simply making a phone call, but they're allowing this pain to exist.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But Democrats also have a promise from the Republican leader in the Senate that he'll talk about health care if they reopen the government.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Would you tell your members of the Democratic Party to - - to relieve the pain in the immediate term from your state?\n\nGOVERNOR WES MOORE: I would tell them that we need to ensure that reopening the government does not mean kicking my people off of health care, that when we're spending time right now over in Western Maryland and Appalachia - and I'm proud to serve as the as the - as a co-chair of the Appalachian Regional - Regional Commission, where we're serving Appalachia, all throughout not just Maryland, but throughout West Virginia, throughout Tennessee and Pennsylvania.\n\nAnd when we're speaking to our folks out there who are already watching their premiums jump, who are already watching everything become more expensive because of these policies, I don't think that anybody, whether in Western Maryland or any part of my state, would say, yes, it's OK, if you just watch my health care go away.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well, health care prices are going up even in the private market for a lot of different reasons.\n\nGOVERNOR WES MOORE: Absolutely.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But let me ask you about what's happening in Maryland.\n\nThis past Tuesday, out in California, we saw this Proposition 50; 64 percent of California voters came out in support of what Gavin Newsom put out there with redistricting. This would allow him to charge ahead with plans to potentially gain an additional five Democratic congressional seats.\n\nThis is gerrymandering. You are looking at midterm redistricting in your state as well. Of eight districts, you only have one Republican. Do you really think Maryland is drawn in an unfair way right now?\n\nGOVERNOR WES MOORE: I think that the reason that I ordered the Governor's Redistricting Advisory Commission is because I want to make sure that we can have a bipartisan group being able to look at the maps in the state of Maryland. This is something that happens every single...\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You don't think these maps are fair now?\n\nGOVERNOR WES MOORE: This is something that happens every single decade. And if other states are going to have this process and go through this - go through this journey of identifying whether or not they have fair maps in a mid-decade cycle, then so should Maryland.\n\nI'm just not sure why we should be playing by a different set of rules than Texas or than Florida or than Ohio or all these other places.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Because you say those states are being unfair. So why adopt unfair policies in your state?\n\nGOVERNOR WES MOORE: This is just simply about making sure that we can have fair and representative maps and we can go through our process.\n\nIt's the reason that I have - I put together this commission, where my job is not to draw the maps, that what we've just simply said is, I want this bipartisan commission to be able to actually speak with the people and to be able to go through their process and just simply say that, if other states are going to go through this process, that we're not just going to sit on our hands because Donald Trump tells us to, that that's not the way this process is going to work.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So, your State Senate president, Democrat Bill Ferguson, says this could backfire.\n\nHe wrote: \"I believe mid-cycle redistricting twist rules for potential short-term advantage while undermining trust in institutions and ultimately democracy. It's too risky and jeopardizes your state's ability to fight against the radical Trump administration.\"\n\nHow do you make sure it doesn't backfire? Do you accept a map that gives you more Republican districts? You're not going to do that.\n\nGOVERNOR WES MOORE: I think fighting for democracy is never risky. I think that's our job as leaders and elected officials. And...\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So, you're not committing to going with the outcome of what this commission provides to you?\n\nGOVERNOR WES MOORE: No, I think the commission - what I want is for the commission to do their work and the commission to do their job. My job is not to draw the maps.\n\nAnd, frankly, it's the state legislature's job to decide to vote on it. That is not my responsibility. My job is to make sure that I'm protecting the democratic process. And the Senate president and I, we agree on the crisis that Donald Trump has put us in.\n\nHe agrees on the fact that we have watched an administration that's using the Constitution like it's a suggestion box. But what I'm simply - and where we - where we differ is the urgency that this moment requires, the fight that this moment requires.\n\nAnd I personally am someone who is not going to allow Donald Trump to determine whether or not Maryland follows this idea of saying, are we going to do everything we can to make sure we're preserving our democracy?\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Governor Moore, thank you for your time this morning.\n\nGOVERNOR WES MOORE: Thank you so much.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And we'll be right back with a lot more Face the Nation, so stay with us.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to the Democratic governor-elect of Virginia, Abigail Spanberger. She joins us this morning from Glen Allen, just outside of Richmond.\n\nWelcome to Face the Nation.\n\nABIGAIL SPANBERGER (D-Virginia) (Governor-Elect): Thank you so much for having me.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Virginia boasts one of the highest numbers of federal workers in the country, and, as you know, many of them are not getting paid.\n\nYou know, some in your party look at your election on Tuesday and the win in New Jersey and say that is permission to hold the line in Congress and refuse to fund the government or fold on the shutdown. Should congressional Democrats view your victory that way?\n\nGOVERNOR-ELECT ABIGAIL SPANBERGER: Absolutely not.\n\nOur victory was a victory that was based on a campaign that was addressing concerns related to costs and chaos. My campaign across the past two years had been focused on hearing the challenges that people are facing all across Virginia.\n\nIt's rising costs in health care, housing, energy, and it's the chaos coming out of Washington that has been impacting Virginians so severely, beginning with the DOGE efforts, of course, continuing with chaotic trade policies, and now in this government shutdown.\n\nVirginians need to and Virginians want to see the government reopen. And my expectation is that we will see a Congress, a Senate, and ultimately a president, driving us in that direction.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But should congressional Democrats open the government and then talk about health care?\n\nGOVERNOR-ELECT ABIGAIL SPANBERGER: The government needs to open, and it needs to open immediately.\n\nWe need the president to demonstrate leadership, bringing people together, endeavoring to get through whatever negotiations need to get through, whether it's before or after. My priority is the - is focusing on the needs and the - the devastation, frankly...\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\n\nGOVERNOR-ELECT ABIGAIL SPANBERGER: ... that more than 300,000 Virginians are facing.\n\nAnd that's just the federal employees, government contractors. They will never get made whole. The entirety of Virginia's economy is impacted by the shutdown, just as we've been impacted by DOGE attacks, and the government needs to reopen quickly.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well, and that's why I'm asking, because there are, what, 825,000 enrollees on food aid in the SNAP program. They're in limbo right now.\n\nGOVERNOR-ELECT ABIGAIL SPANBERGER: That's right.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You have immediate pain. So, at what point do you weigh that against the potential of health care premiums? I mean, this pain is very real and very acute for people in your state right now.\n\nGOVERNOR-ELECT ABIGAIL SPANBERGER: And it's been going on now for weeks, weeks too long. The government needs to reopen because, in addition to the pain that we are already seeing federal employees and government contractors facing....\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But eight Democrats could cross the aisle and do so.\n\nGOVERNOR-ELECT ABIGAIL SPANBERGER: We absolutely need everyone to vote to open the government.\n\nAnd that's not to say that the challenges we're facing within our health care system are not also immediate and acute. Even the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill will have catastrophic impacts on Virginia, taking $26 billion out of our health care, leading to the closure of at least six rural hospitals.\n\nWe've already seen three rural clinics announce their closure.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nGOVERNOR-ELECT ABIGAIL SPANBERGER: Hundreds of thousands will lose their Medicaid.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Let me...\n\nGOVERNOR-ELECT ABIGAIL SPANBERGER: And so the impacts on health care are already catastrophic.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I want to...\n\nGOVERNOR-ELECT ABIGAIL SPANBERGER: But we cannot compound that pain by keeping the government closed.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Let's take a break and finish this on the other side of it.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And we will be right back with a lot more Face the Nation.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to \"FACE THE NATION.\"\n\nWe return to our conversation with Virginia Governor-elect Abigail Spanberger.\n\nGovernor-elect, artificial intelligence has created a really big demand for these data centers. And Virginia has the world's largest concentration of them. Power bills are up nearly seven percent in your state over the past year. Is that driven by the A.I. boom? And, if so, how do you offset those rising energy costs?\n\nGOVERNOR-ELECT ABIGAIL SPANBERGER (D-VA): Well, what we've seen in the - in the research so far is that it is not - the increase costs are not driven by the increase in data centers. There's, you know, some bad energy policies in some of our neighboring states that have driven up prices, particularly in southwest Virginia.\n\nBut looking towards the future, we have to be clear-eyed about the fact that we will have an energy crisis headed into the future. And so here, on the ground in Virginia, we currently have a rate (ph) case where it will be important that large-scale energy users, particularly data centers, that the public know that they are paying their fair share for the energy that they are using. And we have to increase our energy production here at home so that we can meet the demand certainly of larger-scale energy users but also of increased demand from our communities.\n\nAnd it is a real challenge that we have to get ahead of. And that's why among the first affordability plans that I laid out was one focused on energy. It's a challenge that is pervasive across our communities, and particularly acute in southwest Virginia.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Just a few days ago Cornell University reached a $60 million deal with the Trump administration in order to see their federal funding restored. This is the fifth such deal since the administration began this pressure campaign on universities.\n\nI know you went to University of Virginia, as did I, and must be following that UVA cut deals with the government, including kicking out the president of the school. You called that extortion. But now, as governor, are you going to have to play ball with the Department of Education and the Justice Department in order to keep federal government funding going?\n\nGOVERNOR-ELECT ABIGAIL SPANBERGER: So, it should - it should shock everyone that universities, public and private, are receiving demands from the federal government and that dollars - research dollars are being withheld, that our universities are under attack. And certainly what we've seen in the case of the University of Virginia, of a popular, experienced, excellent president, was pushed out. And on the ground here we did not see our governor, in any way, step up in defense of our university.\n\nAnd the idea that the federal government would be withholding federal dollars, you know, including dollars already appropriated by Congress for research in order to compel universities to take certain actions, it is absolute federal government overreach. And as governor, I will be clear- eyed about ensuring that we have structures in place, including boards of visitors across our universities, that want to defend academic freedom and, frankly, the viability and vitality of extraordinary institutions, like the University of Virginia.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about your party. In 2020, when Democrats lost House seats, you said \"we need to not ever use the word socialist or socialism ever again.\" There are some who look to Tuesday's win in New York City of a Democratic socialist and say that your party's actually being rewarded for echoing progressive policies. Does that victory create a branding problem for Democrats?\n\nGOVERNOR-ELECT ABIGAIL SPANBERGER: Well, certainly, you know, I'm excited about what we did here in Virginia on Tuesday in - I campaigned addressing - wanting to address the issues of costs and stopping the chaos. I'm a capitalist. I'm a Democrat. And I won by 15 points in Virginia. You look to New Jersey, and a similar story in Mikie Sherrill's win, now the governor- elect there.\n\nAnd so I think, you know, certainly we're a big tent party, but when I look at what led to the success that we had here and the - you know, the mandate for real governance here in the Commonwealth of Virginia, it was based on what I campaigned on, the efforts to really address the challenges that people are facing in a day-to-day basis. And - and now it's on us to deliver and prove that really truly the mandate that we have to work on lowering costs and strengthening our schools and keeping our communities safe and creating steady leadership here in the Commonwealth of Virginia particularly in light of the chaos coming out of Washington, that not only was it a winning message, but the winning path towards governance.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you very much for your time this morning, Governor- elect Abigail Spanberger, the - who will be the first female governor ever of the state of Virginia.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: On Friday, we spoke with one of the other big Democratic winners last Tuesday, New Jersey's Governor-elect Mikie Sherrill, who is currently a member of Congress, and asked whether given her new role as the chief executive of a state hard hit by the shutdown she would support the Democratic Party position of blocking government funding until Obamacare subsidies are extended.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\nGOVERNOR-ELECT MIKIE SHERRILL (D-NJ): Well, it's really important that we keep up that fight because we see in the market costs going up by 175 percent if the Republicans don't address this health care crisis. We know that there have already been huge cuts in the one big, beautiful bill to people's access to health care.\n\nAnd, you know, when we look at this crisis, so much of it is really imposed by Donald Trump. So, there is money for him to put towards SNAP funding that he's refusing to do, even though courts are demanding it. Now he's kind of slow walking it, making it very difficult for states to do that illegally. And courts are holding him accountable.\n\nWe see with air traffic control problems, some of this is because the administration hasn't moved quickly enough at Newark in some of the problems we had over the summer. So, we're already down by 25 percent. Now, with this crisis going on, because the president refuses to open up the government, we're seeing another 10 percent in flights being derailed, and we see continued late and delayed flights.\n\nSo, it's time that the government - that the Trump administration, that Republicans in the House and the Senate get serious about opening up government.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: When we look at our recent polling, a majority of Americans are really concerned that this shutdown is going to hurt the overall economy. How can you justify the damage?\n\nGOVERNOR-ELECT MIKIE SHERRILL: Well, it truly is hurting the economy. And you can't justify the damage, which is why the president and the Senate and Republican majority in the House need to get this government open. And they need to do so in a way that's going to stop punishing the American people.\n\nI think what we saw with this election is the American people need - you know, are really demanding that our federal government operate in a way that is going to stop punishing them economically. I'll tell you, I ran on affordability, on the fact that I'm going to fight in Trenton to make sure we're cutting through red tape and permitting to drive down costs. But also that I'm going to continue to fight that - for Washington to address things like the tariff program, which is raising costs on everything from a cup of coffee to groceries, to fight the one big beautiful bill, which is continuing to raise costs on education, innovation, housing, health care, to continue to fight this government shutdown so that we can really address health care needs here in the state.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You keep saying it's up to the president to reopen the government, but you withheld your own vote on that continuing resolution, that short-term funding bill. And over in the Senate, Leader Thune is tearing into Democrats for that decision. He said, \"it shows you're not caring that there are men and women in uniform frequenting food banks because of the shutdown, not making represent payments, trying to borrow.\" He said Dems view this as leverage. And he used that word because it was your House leadership, Katherine Clark, justified withholding votes to end the shutdown, saying, that's one of the few parts of leverage that Democrats have.\n\nHow do you respond to this accusation that it's actually Democrats who are being heartless here?\n\nGOVERNOR-ELECT MIKIE SHERRILL: Well, when you have the Republicans that have the presidency, they have the majority in the Senate, they have the majority in the House, they've even - many would day, including myself, taken over the court system, then they have a responsibility to open up this government. And I have to tell you, as a veteran myself, I know how devastating that is.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well, it was - it was with Clark who said those votes are leverage.\n\nGOVERNOR-ELECT MIKIE SHERRILL: Leverage to serve the American people. I mean we see again and again these Republican attacks on everything from health care - look, if they don't fund the Affordable Care Act, costs are going to go up by 175 percent for people here in New Jersey at already high levels. That is going to kick so many people off health care. That's on top of the huge Medicare cuts that we're seeing in the one big beautiful bill, on top of the tariff cuts that are raising grocery prices everywhere, on top of the fight he's in, which is raising gas prices.\n\nSo, again and again, we're seeing the Trump administration punishing people. And these Republicans have got to come to the table and they've got to start really working for the American people. And this election showed that.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But when you were talking about the extension of the health care subsidies, why isn't the promise to hold a vote on those health care subsidies enough for Democrats to vote to reopen the government?\n\nGOVERNOR-ELECT MIKIE SHERRILL: So, we are working hard to address the concerns for the American people. And Republicans again and again are refusing to address that. So, right now this is part of how we get the government open. And they should do it right now.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the - Leader Thune said he'll hold a vote.\n\nGOVERNOR-ELECT MIKIE SHERRILL: I think we have seen what the promises that Republicans have made have been worth. What he needs to do is actually put the subsidies in. We can serve the American people. We can drive down health care costs. And that's really key.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Let's talk a bit about your election. As you said, the economy was front and center for you. Energy prices in particular you focused in on. In New Jersey, they're up 19 percent over the past year versus six percent nationwide. I know you want to declare a state of emergency day one, but what does it actually mean? How quickly will prices come down?\n\nGOVERNOR-ELECT MIKIE SHERRILL: So, the state of emergency will freeze rate hikes because there are some rate hikes that are set to come into play in the next several months. And I, you know, I'm not going to allow those to be put on the back of the New Jersey rate pair. And we see that the can has been kicked down the road by too many people.\n\nSo, the utility companies have already come to the table so say, OK, let's negotiate those rate hikes. We have money that comes in through the BP (ph) view (ph) to defray the costs. But what's really going to also happen is very quickly I'm turning to adding a lot of power to our grid. Right now, PJM, that's our regional grid operator, has really screwed up the market for various reasons and so every electron we produce in New Jersey will defray the costs of electricity we have to buy on the market. So, that's why immediately I'm going to cut through red tape and permitting delays to get solar done. We're going to continue to build out battery storage. And then, in the first budget, we will expand modernization of our natural gas facilities and, in the long term, nuclear.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You said on CNN this past week that \"there's a feeling working people have not been heard\" and that \"there's too much caution and mediocrity in the Democratic Party today.\" What did you mean by that?\n\nGOVERNOR-ELECT MIKIE SHERRILL: That as I was talking to people across this state, thousands of people, they wanted to see an agenda to get their costs down. And something that was going to take place quickly. As I said, you know, I'm not writing a strongly worded letter, I'm not doing a ten-year plan, I'm on day one declaring a state of emergency. Not just because I'm furious that, you know, as too many people have failed New Jersey rate payers, that costs are being dumped on them. Yes, that is a huge problem for me that I'm addressing. But it also, I think, conveys that sense of urgency that I feel to work for the people of New Jersey so that they know that this is a day one issue for me.\n\nThey also want to see somebody, though, that has their backs because they know that these tariffs are raising costs. They know that the one big, beautiful bill is going to take away their health care. They know that a tax on the Gateway Tunnel project are going to raise costs here and really cut into job opportunities. So, they want to know that whoever is governing is going to be focused on governing for them, not a party of one like Donald Trump.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well, your criticism there was of fellow Democrats, as I understood it. But let me ask you about Speaker Emeritus Nancy Pelosi. She just announced that she is going to be leaving Congress. When I spoke to her last on this program, she indicated that she knows it's a problem recruiting new candidates, in part because of the environment we're in, including just how nasty our politics are and the security threats. And she said that's discouraging in particular women who fear the impact on children.\n\nWhat do you say to those considering for office right now? Are you seeing that, that female candidates are fearful of doing what you just did?\n\nGOVERNOR-ELECT MIKIE SHERRILL: Well, we worked very hard here in New Jersey to really build out a future and an idea that's going to bring everybody in and really working hard to keep people safe. Public safety is a huge somehow for me and for people across the state as we double down on our constitutional protections, freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, et cetera. But it is a scary time.\n\nI remember, right after I won my primary, the assassinations in Minnesota took place. And here I have four kids and I'm suddenly thinking, oh my gosh, am I putting them at risk by running?\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nGOVERNOR-ELECT MIKIE SHERRILL: But, you know, what I think most of us are weighing is, as moms, if we're candidates is, what is my kids' future look like if I don't run? And that's on balance, I think, people are choosing to run. I see women across our state running. We have, you know, people newly getting into races and also some of the great powerful women in our state continuing to serve. So, I don't think it's dissuading them. But it certainly is on our minds as we are thinking about, how are we going to keep our families safe as we are running for elected office.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Congresswoman, we'll be watching as you transition into being the next governor of New Jersey.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to the Republican governor of West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who joins us from Charleston.\n\nGood morning to you, sir.\n\nGOVERNOR PATRICK MORRISEY (R-WV): Hey, good morning, Margaret. Good to be with you.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So, your state has one of the highest poverty rates in the country, nearly 16 percent of residents rely on food stamps, that SNAP program we've been talking about. In fact, the very first food stamp pilot program began in West Virginia back in the 1960s.\n\nGiven the current shutdown and how rural your state is, I wonder, are you able to get help to those who need it right now?\n\nGOVERNOR PATRICK MORRISEY: Absolutely. Look, great question. I do want to start out, first of all, thanking you for having me on the program.\n\nOne piece of information coming out of West Virginia, we've had a mining accident, and we have teams down looking for a missing miner. I just want to say, that our hearts and prayers go out to the family of that miner. We're doing everything we can to locate that person.\n\nNow, when it comes to the government shutdown, we're doing everything we can to help those in need. At the very beginning, I started standing up for the federal workers, and we announced that to address some of the concerns with food, we were going to send significant dollars to the food banks by tomorrow. That will be up to $13 million. I've activated the National Guard. And we're doing things to make sure that no one in West Virginia goes hungry.\n\nOur people are hurting right now, and I'm doing everything I can to solve the problems while Washington bickers. But I do want to be clear, this shutdown could come to an end right away. It's up to Chuck Schumer or just having six more Democrats step across the line.\n\nThere's been a clean CR on the table available for some time. People should take advantage of that and let's get the government reopened and then we can go about the business of fixing the many other problems facing our country.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. I'm sorry to hear about the mining accident.\n\nBut on the issue of food stamps, Governor Moore of Maryland said that he had been told the state would be punished essentially for fronting the money. Is that the message the federal government also gave to you, West Virginia won't get those dollars back?\n\nGOVERNOR PATRICK MORRISEY: No. Well, first of all, I want to emphasize, the Trump administration has been a great partner to work with throughout the past year in terms of the economic progress that we're making here in West Virginia.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Sure.\n\nGOVERNOR PATRICK MORRISEY: But also we've reached out - I was the first person to reach out to the federal government. So we had our national parks reopened.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nGOVERNOR PATRICK MORRISEY: And now we're working, by activating the Guard, and putting resources at the food banks. We're actually making a difference to keep people from getting hungry.\n\nSo, we've been in very close contact with the Trump administration. And they've been very cooperative.\n\nLook, I think they know, and everyone's frustrated, that you're six votes short. These Democrats are saying no to reopening the government. It's a Schumer shutdown. I think President Trump is bending over backwards to be helpful, and I'm excited about the things he's doing in terms of how he's handling this and the broader economic issues at large.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well, there is the fight in the courts specifically about providing full food aid. The Trump administration initiated that. I want to play something for you because 70 percent of West Virginians voted for President Trump in the last election.\n\nGOVERNOR PATRICK MORRISEY: Right.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But here's how he described the food stamp program.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nDONALD TRUMP, (President of the United States): Largely, when you talk about SNAP, you're talking about largely Democrats. But I'm president. I want to help everybody. I want to help Democrats and Republicans. But when you're talking about SNAP, if you look, it's largely Democrats. They're hurting their own people.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Have you made the White House aware of the pain from the food SNAP - the food program disruptions specifically?\n\nGOVERNOR PATRICK MORRISEY: Yes. So, we've been working closely with the White House. And I think they know. They've been very supportive of a lot of the efforts that we're taking to make sure that people don't get hungry. That's the ultimate goal. We have to make sure we're protecting our people.\n\nMargaret, you're right, we have 270,000 plus people on SNAP. But, once again, there's one reason why they're not getting the resources. It's because people are insisting to add all these new pieces on top of just a bill (ph) to keep the government open. That's the concern we have.\n\nBut we've been getting really good response from the Trump administration across the board.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: OK.\n\nGOVERNOR PATRICK MORRISEY: Whether we're talking about the food issues, whether we're talking about our energy jobs or even just recently the conversations we're having about President Trump's rural health transformation bill to put resources upfront to save public expenditures at the back end.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about that.\n\nGOVERNOR PATRICK MORRISEY: That's the kind of good working relationship we've had.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about that because I know West Virginia has one of the highest rates in the country for government insurance. There's concern about rural hospitals. There is this rural health transformation program Congress set up. Your state could get $100 million a year for five years, but your West Virginia Hospital Association says that your hospitals are going to lose more than $1 billion per year because of this latest big, beautiful bill Republicans passed. How do you make up that kind of shortfall?\n\nGOVERNOR PATRICK MORRISEY: Well, I think what President Trump and RFK and Dr. Oz are trying to do is common sense. If you subscribe to the adage, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, what they're trying to do is invest the single largest amount of money in improving rural health. And in West Virginia, that means everything because we're a very rural state.\n\nSo, the resources can go to invest in our people, to invest in our hospitals, our providers, and the technology that actually could move the needle in terms of improving health care outcomes upfront.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nGOVERNOR PATRICK MORRISEY: Attacking obesity and COPD and substance use disorder.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: OK.\n\nGOVERNOR PATRICK MORRISEY: So, we're really excited about that because if we apply the resources the right way, I don't think we're going to have the diminution of public expenditures at the back end.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: OK.\n\nGOVERNOR PATRICK MORRISEY: This is the common-sense approach we're seeing from the Trump administration that we're not seeing from Schumer and the Democrats in Congress.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: OK. All right.\n\nGovernor, we have to leave it there. We are out of time. Thank you.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: The United States Marine Corps will mark its 250th birthday tomorrow. And Veterans Day is Tuesday.\n\nFor many veterans, the end of their military service is not the end of their public service. More than 700,000 veterans work as civilians in the federal government. And due to the shutdown, most are furloughed or have been working without pay for weeks.\n\nUnlike veterans, active-duty service members have been getting paid during the shutdown, but even that lifeline will expire Saturday. And some context, many military families already struggle with a growing number forced to seek assistance from food pantries over the last few years amid high prices and mounting economic pressure.",

        "description": "Gov. Gavin Newsom, D-Calif., said that Democrats need to own up to ceding ground on the masculinity crisis facing men and boys and urged the party to take the issue seriously.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom, D-Calif., urged Democrats to \"own up\" to ceding ground on the masculinity crisis during an interview Sunday.\n\n\"I say this as a Democrat: We need to own up to the fact that we ceded that ground. We walked away from this crisis of men and boys. Trump saw it as an electoral opportunity to exploit it, but he's done nothing to deliver in terms of results to address those anxieties, which are real,\" he said during an interview on CNN's \"State of the Union.\"\n\nNewsom told CNN host Jake Tapper that suicide rates, dropout rates and suspension rates were off the charts for men.\n\n\"This is an issue our party needs to address. We can't afford, from an electoral perspective, to lose these folks. But we also can't on the basis of our values and what we claim to care about and represent, and I say that on behalf of women that need better men,\" he added.\n\nGOV. GAVIN NEWSOM REVEALS WHEN HE'LL START THINKING ABOUT A POTENTIAL 2028 RUN\n\nThe California governor pointed to Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk's work with the younger generation, and said he understood their \"grievance.\"\n\n\"Charlie was organizing around it. People weren't aware of what Turning Point USA was. I talked to so many Democrats who said, 'who's Charlie Kirk?' I said, 'Well, your son knows about him,'\" the governor said. Kirk was shot and killed at a campus event in September.\n\nDuring Newsom's podcast conversation with Kirk in March 2025, the pair found some common ground on biological male participation in women's sports.\n\nKirk asked Newsom, \"You, as the governor, should step out and say no. Would you do something like that? Would you say no men in female sports?\"\n\nOBAMA CALLS NEWSOM'S CALIFORNIA REDISTRICTING MOVE A 'RESPONSIBLE APPROACH' TO GOP TACTICS\n\n\"Well, I think it's an issue of fairness,\" Newsom replied. \"I completely agree with you on that. It's deeply unfair.\"\n\nNewsom told Tapper that Democrats had been slow to recognize the challenges facing men.\n\n\"It's a real issue. Democrats need to understand it not as a zero-sum issue, but an issue that defines not just our politics, but I think, defines our families, our relationships, defines the culture in this moment,\" Newsom added.",

        "title": "Transcript: Maryland Gov. Wes Moore on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan,\" Nov. 9, 2025",
        "description": "The following is the transcript of the interview with Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, a Democrat, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Nov. 9, 2025.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We're joined now by the Democratic governor of Maryland, Wes Moore. Good to have you here in person.\n\nGOV. WES MOORE: Great to be with you. Thank you.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So, Governor, one in eight Americans use food stamps. In Maryland, you have about 700,000 people, as I understand it, who rely on this for food aid. Since the Supreme Court put that stay in place on Friday, do you know whether that money will actually be available to residents in your state to buy food?\n\nGOV. MOORE: We don't know, and that's why we're not waiting. It is why, just in the past few days, I have authorized over $10 million that's going towards heating assistance for people in the state of Maryland. Over $10 million has gone to our Maryland food banks that we have made public transportation free for all of our federal workers, because they are, in many cases, are going to work and not being paid. And I have also authorized $62 million to go towards SNAP to make sure that SNAP is not going to be interrupted for the people of Maryland for as long as we can, despite the fact that we are waiting for the President of the United States to finally do his job. We are watching the president who is literally breaking the law so people can starve, but we're not going to sit there and tolerate in our state.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you just heard Director Hassett say that they are trying to follow the law, which is why they went to the courts. The USDA did say they were going to work towards implementing full payments and then there was this Supreme Court stay put in place. So, do you have clarity on when money might be coming through at all, what's the federal government telling you?\n\nGOV. MOORE: There is no clarity- clarity at all. In the past- in the past six days, we've received four different measures of guidance from the USDA and from the Trump administration about how to handle it. Where initially it was said, well, listen, we want the states to help, to support and despite the fact that this program was built as a partnership between the federal government and the states, where the federal government were really helping to underwrite these costs for people, and then once we decided to step up and say, we are going to make sure that our people are going to be okay--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: -- You are fronting the money?--\n\nGOV. MOORE: -- That we are going to front the money. We've now received guidance saying the states are going to be punished for fronting the money. There is a chaos, and it is an intentional chaos that we are seeing from this administration, and where they have money for everything. They got money to fight wars, they got money for ballrooms, they got money for everything, but when it comes to supporting the American people, that's now when they are crying, well, we're broke, and that's not what the law requires us to do.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: As you know, the White House says those- those sponsorships for the ballroom are separate from government money. But on- on the issue, though, of the shutdown itself. On Friday, we did see the Democratic Leader Schumer offer to end it if Republicans agree to a one-year extension of the Obamacare health care subsidies. Republicans said that's a- that's a nonstarter. This is going to make this a big issue for the midterms. But would you- would you tell the Democrats on Capitol Hill to dig in? That the pain that the people who are living in your state is somehow going to be worth it in the end, for an extension of a tax credit?\n\nGOV. MOORE: There is no pain that is worth it. Our people are hurting, and they're hurting because of these games that we continue to see from Washington, DC.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But would you tell Democrats, just take the vote, open the government, then keep negotiating health care?\n\nGOV. MOORE: I want the government reopened now. There is no state that is dealing with more of an impact from this than the state of Maryland. We have over 260,000 federal workers within our state. That even before the shutdown, Donald Trump had fired over 15,000 Maryland workers, federal workers, more than any other state in this country. But I also know that saying that a prerequisite for having the federal government open shouldn't be kicking up premiums by 90%, by kicking people off of health care. There's a bar- there's a- there's a- there's a barbaric nature to this ask and this request, particularly when we're watching how the Trump you know- the Trump administration, they have the White House, the House and the Senate. They can get this deal done by just simply making a phone call, but they're allowing this pain to exist.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But Democrats also have a promise from the Republican leader in the Senate that he'll talk about health care if they reopen the government. Why isn't that good enough? Would you tell your members of the Democratic Party to- to relieve the pain in the immediate term from your state?\n\nGOV. MOORE: I would tell them that we need to ensure that reopening the government does not mean kicking my people off of health care. That when we're spending time right now over in Western Maryland and Appalachia, and I'm proud to serve as the as the- as a co-chair of the Appalachian Regional- Regional Commission where we're serving Appalachia all throughout not just Maryland, but throughout West Virginia, throughout Tennessee and Pennsylvania. And when we're speaking to our folks out there who are already watching their premiums jump, who are already watching everything become more expensive because of these policies, I don't think that anybody, whether in Western Maryland or any part of my state, would say yes, it's okay, if you just watch my health care go away.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well, health care prices are going up, even in the private market, for a lot of different reasons. But let me ask you about what's happening in Maryland. This past Tuesday, out in California, we saw this Proposition 50. 64% of California voters came out in support of what Gavin Newsom put out there with redistricting. This would allow him to charge ahead with plans to potentially gain an additional five Democratic congressional seats. This is gerrymandering. You are looking at midterm redistricting in your state as well. Of eight districts, you only have one Republican. Do you really think Maryland is drawn in an unfair way right now?\n\nGOV. WES MOORE: I think that the reason that I ordered the Governor's Redistricting Advisory Commission is because I want to make sure that we can have a bipartisan group being able to look at the maps in the state of Maryland. This is something that happens every single--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You don't think these maps are fair now?\n\nGOV. MOORE: --this is something that happens every single decade. And if other states are going to have this process and go through this- go through this journey of identifying whether or not they have fair maps in a mid-decade cycle, then so should Maryland. I'm just not sure why we should be playing by a different set of rules than Texas, or than Florida, or than Ohio or all these other places.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Because you say those states are being unfair. So why adopt unfair policies in your state?\n\nGOV. MOORE: This is just simply about making sure that we can have fair and representative maps and we can go through our process. It's the reason that I put together this commission where my job is not to draw the maps, that- what we've just simply said is I want this bipartisan commission to be able to actually speak with the people and to be able to go through their process and just simply say that if other states are going to go through this process, that we're not just going to sit on our hands because Donald Trump tells us to. That's not the way this process is going to work.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Your State Senate President, Democrat Bill Ferguson says this could backfire. He wrote, 'I believe mid cycle redistricting twist rules for potential short term advantage while undermining trust in institutions and ultimately, democracy. It's too risky and jeopardizes your state's ability to fight against the radical Trump administration.' How do you make sure it doesn't backfire? Do you accept a map that gives you more Republican districts? You're not going to do that.\n\nGOV. MOORE: I think fighting for democracy is never risky. I think that's our job as leaders and elected officials, and--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So, you're not committing to going with the outcome of what this Commission provides to you?\n\nGOV. MOORE: No, I think the commission of what I want is for the commission to do their work and the commission to do their job. My job is not to draw the maps, and frankly, it's a state legislature's job to decide to vote on it. That is not my responsibility. My job is to make sure that I'm protecting the democratic process. And the Senate President and I, we agree on the crisis that Donald Trump has put us in. He agrees on the fact that we have watched a administration that's using the Constitution like it's a suggestion box. But what I'm simply- and where we- where we differ, is the urgency that this moment requires, the fight that this moment requires. And I personally am someone who is not going to allow Donald Trump to determine whether or not Maryland follows this idea of saying, are we going to do everything we can to make sure we're preserving our democracy.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Governor Moore, thank you for your time this morning.\n\nGOV. MOORE: Thank you so much.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And we'll be right back with a lot more 'Face the Nation.' So, stay with us.",

        "title": "What Did Men Do to Deserve This?",
        "description": "Bald, white, and jacked, Scott Galloway is an action figure of the tech-and-finance overclass. He's an angel investor, a best-selling author, and a personal-finance guru. He podcasts constantly: his hosting duties include \"The Prof G Pod,\" which offers business-news takes and career advice; \"Pivot,\" in which he riffs on news of the day with the tech journalist Kara Swisher; and the self-explanatory \"Raging Moderates,\" with the Fox News personality Jessica Tarlov. For someone of this \u00dcbermensch milieu, he is surprisingly progressive and self-aware -- he often acknowledges that his wealth and achievements were made likelier by his race, sex, publicly funded education, and devoted mother, who raised him mostly on her own.\n\nIn recent years, Galloway has also become a leading evangelist for a notion that rapidly solidified into conventional wisdom: America's young men are in crisis. \"Seldom in recent memory has there been a cohort that's fallen farther, faster,\" he writes in his new book, \"Notes on Being a Man.\" To make his case, Galloway pulls from a heavily circulated set of statistics. At colleges and universities nationwide, female students outnumber males by about three to two. Among young adults, men are more likely than women to live with their parents; by their mid-thirties, more than fifteen per cent of men still live with their folks, compared to less than nine per cent of women. Men die by suicide at about three and a half times the rate that women do. Men's real wages are lower for the tenth and fiftieth percentiles of earners than they were in 1979. Currently, the unemployment rate among young men with bachelor's degrees between the ages of twenty-three and thirty is close to double that of their female peers.\n\nThese numbers have roused bipartisan concern. In March, Governor Gavin Newsom, of California, on the d\u00e9but episode of his new podcast, welcomed the conservative influencer Charlie Kirk, who lamented Gen Z as the \"most alcohol-addicted, most drug-addicted, most suicidal, most depressed, most medicated generation in history.\" And these under-thirties, Kirk said, were receiving a pernicious message: \"You're not going to have the same American Dream that your parents would have.\" He and his fellow conservative organizers \"saw this as an opportunity,\" he added, \"especially with young men.\" Donald Trump won men under age thirty by fifty-six per cent in the 2024 election, up fifteen points from 2020. For these gains, Kirk credited the coalescing electoral power of the right-leaning constellation of podcasters and streamers known as the manosphere, which encompasses libertarian bros, evangelical Christians, and white nationalists.\n\nNewsom, who is angling to become the next Democratic Presidential nominee, appeared to be listening closely. At the end of July, he issued an executive order intended \"to confront California's growing crisis of connection and opportunity for men and boys.\" A week later, another likely Democratic contender, the former Chicago mayor Rahm Emanuel, published an op-ed in the Washington Post that linked unaffordable housing and health care to an \"increasingly despondent\" mood among young men. \"You don't have to be an incel to believe that the 'system' is fundamentally broken and rigged against your success,\" Emanuel wrote.",

        "description": "Vice President JD Vance, the first Marine to hold the post in history, delivered remarks at the Marine Corps' 250th birthday ball in Washington, D.C., Saturday. (Credit: POOL)\n\nVice President JD Vance took the stage at the Marine Corps' 250th Birthday Ball in Washington, D.C., on Saurday, greeting a crowd of Marines in dress blues with a booming, \"How we doing, Marines?\"\n\nHe grinned as the ballroom erupted in cheers. \"It's so great to be here to celebrate 250 years of the United States Marine Corps,\" he said, drawing loud applause.\n\n\"That, my friends, is what the Marine Corps does -- it keeps us honest.\"\n\nThe address marked the start of Veterans Day weekend and underscored the White House's emphasis on military strength and service.\n\nVANCE ISSUES MIDTERM WARNING, SAYS DEMOCRATS' ANGER COULD DRIVE 2026 TURNOUT\n\nThe vice president -- himself a proud Marine veteran -- earned a standing ovation when he reminded the crowd that he was \"the very first vice president of the United States to have been a United States Marine.\"\n\nVance reflected on joining the Marines as a 19-year-old recruit on the yellow footprints of Parris Island, South Carolina.\n\n\"The Marine Corps has kept me honest,\" he said. \"It gave me great training, it gave me a sense of purpose, and it gave me lifelong friends.\"\n\nHe credited those lessons with shaping his life long after service. \"The Marine Corps has done more for me than I can possibly repay,\" he said. \"But the thing that I promise, so long as I have the honor of being your vice president, is that I will continue to honor the United States Marine Corps.\"\n\nVP VANCE'S CAMP ACCUSES CALIFORNIA GOV.

        "title": "OpenAI CEO Sam Altman served subpoena onstage during San Francisco...",
        "description": "OpenAI CEO Sam Altman's public conversation with Golden State Warriors coach Steve Kerr took a bizarre turn Monday night when a man rushed the stage at San Francisco's Sydney Goldstein Theater to serve him with a subpoena, according to reports.\n\nThe confrontation happened just minutes into the sold-out event, hosted by civic organizer Manny Yekutiel, when a man from the second row jumped onto the stage holding out a document and announcing that he had a subpoena for Altman, SFGATE said.\n\nYekutiel immediately intercepted the man and handed the paper to a theater security guard, who escorted the intruder away as the audience booed.\n\nAltman remained seated and appeared startled but unharmed.\n\nThe next day, a spokesperson for the San Francisco Public Defender's Office confirmed the man was one of its investigators.\n\n\"An investigator from the San Francisco Public Defender's Office lawfully served a subpoena on Mr. Altman because he is a potential witness in a pending criminal case,\" spokesperson Valerie Ibarra said in a statement to SFGATE.\n\n\"Our investigators first made several prior attempts to serve the subpoena at Altman's company headquarters and via its online portal.\"\n\nThe activist group Stop AI, which has staged repeated demonstrations outside OpenAI's headquarters, took credit for the incident online.\n\nIn a post on X, the group wrote: \"Our public defender successfully subpoenaed Sam Altman to appear at our trial where we will be tried for non-violently blocking the front door of OpenAI on multiple occasions and blocking the road in front of their office.\"\n\n\"All of our non-violent actions against OpenAI were an attempt to slow OpenAI down in their attempted murder of everyone and every living thing on earth.\"\n\nStop AI said its members face trial this month in San Francisco Superior Court for trespassing and obstruction during past protests, describing the proceedings as a chance to put \"AI's extinction threat\" before a jury.\n\nLucie Faulknor, the theater's house manager, told the San Francisco Standard that she personally escorted the man out and that he seemed calm and said he had done what he needed to do.\n\nYekutiel later said he thought the incident seemed like a stunt, noting the envelope was covered in scribbles and the man appeared to be in costume.\n\nCalifornia law allows service of a subpoena even if the target refuses to accept the papers physically, as long as they are presented and left within view.\n\nThe interruption briefly overshadowed Altman's wide-ranging talk, which covered wealth inequality, the future of artificial intelligence, and the company's controversial content policies.\n\nDuring the discussion, Altman addressed the backlash over his Oct. 14 tweet celebrating that ChatGPT could generate erotic material for verified adult users, calling it \"one of my dumbest mistakes of the year.\"\n\nHe said the change was part of OpenAI's effort to give adults \"a huge degree of individual freedom,\" but admitted, \"I wish I used a different example.\"\n\nThe policy update, announced a day after Gov. Gavin Newsom vetoed a bill that would have imposed new limits on AI tools to protect minors, drew immediate ridicule and criticism from lawmakers and parents.\n\nAltman said he stands by the company's decision to lift restrictions for verified adults but conceded that his messaging \"was not well thought out.\"\n\nHe added that OpenAI would continue to block material related to mental health or self-harm but would not \"draw moral lines\" for consenting adults.",

        "description": "Political analyst and attorney Katie Zacharia joins 'Fox News @ Night' to discuss the impact that Gov. Gavin Newsom's, D-Calif., Prop 50 will have on California and the possible precedent it could set for redistricting nationwide.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom in Texas on Saturday told a crowd that Democrats winning back the House of Representatives in 2026 is \"the whole thing.\"\n\nNewsom, 58, continued to ride high over the weekend, four days after California's Proposition 50 -- to redistrict the state's congressional map in favor of Democrats -- passed in a landslide.\n\nNewsom also couldn't resist taking a jab at his frequent foe, President Donald Trump.\n\n\"He is an historic president, however -- historically unpopular,\" he told the crowd in Houston. \"And he had a very bad night on Tuesday.\"\n\nOBAMA CALLS NEWSOM'S CALIFORNIA REDISTRICTING MOVE A 'RESPONSIBLE APPROACH' TO GOP TACTICS\n\nAlong with Prop 50 in California, Democrats also won gubernatorial races in New Jersey and Virginia and Democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani handily beat Democrat-turned-Independent candidate Andrew Cuomo in the New York City mayoral election.\n\nProposition 50 was a response to Texas' legislature redistricting their congressional map in favor of Republicans over the summer, and on Tuesday after Proposition 50 passed, Newsom called on other Democratic states to follow suit.\n\n\"We need to see other states, their remarkable leaders that have been doing remarkable things, meet this moment head-on as well,\" he said in a late-night news conference on Tuesday. \"We can de facto end Donald Trump's presidency as we know it, the minute Speaker Jeffries gets sworn in as speaker of the House of Representatives. It is all on the line.\"\n\nNEWSOM SET TO RALLY TEXAS DEMS WITH VICTORY LAP DAYS AFTER PROP 50 PASSES: 'CALIFORNIA STEPPED UP'\n\nHe continued his celebration on Saturday, telling the crowd: \"There were lines around the block two hours after polling had stopped because people wanted to be heard, not just seen, they wanted to send a message. But as I said, we cannot rest until we take it back.\"\n\nThe governor reiterated, \"There is no more important race in our lifetimes than the House of Representatives, and taking back the House and getting speaker [Hakeem] Jeffries sworn in next November. It's the whole thing. It's the whole thing.\"\n\n\"And so that starts today,\" he continued. \"It started on Tuesday.\"\n\nNewsom added, \"We can shape the future here in Texas. We can shape the future all across the South and across the United States of America. You have that power.\"\n\nTrump and the GOP have spearheaded an effort to pad the party's razor-thin House majority to keep control of the chamber in the 2026 midterms, when the party in power traditionally faces political headwinds and loses seats. Missouri, North Carolina, and Ohio have drawn new maps as part of the president's push.\n\nTrump is aiming to prevent what happened during his first term in the White House when Democrats reclaimed the House majority in the 2018 midterm elections.\n\nAlthough he hasn't announced his intentions to run for president, Newsom has been widely seen as a possible frontrunner for Democrats in the 2028 presidential election.\n\nCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nWhile two other Democratic blue state governors with likely national ambitions in 2028, JB Pritzker of Illinois and Wes Moore of Maryland, are mulling new maps in their states to create one or two more blue-leaning congressional districts, Newsom has been the most visible leader so far in the redistricting wars and the first Democrat to succeed.\n\nFox News' Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Trump, reeling from election night, tightens focus on midterms",
        "description": "Sweeping Democratic wins in this week's elections have given new urgency to President Donald Trump's efforts to midterm-proof his second term, with the president keenly aware of the consequences if Republicans lose control of Congress.\n\nSecuring the midterms won't be easy. Tuesday's results underscore the extent to which the political and economic paradigm has shifted for Trump from his electoral victory a year ago, a period in which he aggressively reshaped Washington with little opposition. Now, the 2026 midterms are shaping up as a much tougher referendum on his political brand. Polls -- and the GOP's electoral setback -- indicate voters have grown weary of the president's firebrand politics and uneven stewardship of the economy.\n\nEager to maintain Republican control of the House and Senate, Trump has resorted to drastic measures. He's directed Republican governors to redraw congressional districts in order to create more GOP House seats. He's also demanded Republican Senate leaders scrap the filibuster rule to pass national restrictions on mail-in voting and voter identification requirements, arguing without evidence that elections have been plagued by widespread fraud.\n\nTrump has promised a rare national Republican convention ahead of the midterms to rally his base. He's also expected to step up his travel in 2026 as part of his midterms push, people close to the White House said, though he has thus far taken few political trips. Aides say he also plans to refocus his message around the cost of living, which swung the off-year elections against the GOP in New York City, Virginia, New Jersey and elsewhere.\n\n\"The only problem is the Republicans don't talk about it and Republicans should start talking about it and use their heads,\" Trump told reporters Thursday as he discussed his party's political woes around affordability issues.\n\nShould Republicans lose their congressional majorities, an emboldened Democratic Party would be poised to rein in Trump's policies on trade, taxes, immigration and the federal workforce. They'd also be empowered to launch congressional investigations, backed by subpoena power, into a wide swath of presidential actions, risking embarrassing or politically inconvenient revelations.\n\nSuch an outcome could also shatter the image of strength Trump has wielded to maintain an iron grip on his party and dominate his opponents, while forcing him to stare down his own political mortality as his party begins charting the contest to succeed him.\n\nPeople close to the president say he's desperate to avoid a repeat of the midterms during his first term, when Democrats won control of the House. Trump's legislative agenda stalled and he was impeached twice.\n\nBarred from appearing on the ballot in 2028, Trump is also grappling with ways to avoid the \"lame duck\" final years of a president's second term -- including by floating an end-run around the Constitution to run again before acknowledging it's not allowed.\n\nDemocratic candidates won top-tier and down-ballot races around the country by focusing on cost-of-living issues that dominate voters' attention. That revealed the risks of Trump's freewheeling style; the president's attention the last few weeks has been on negotiations with China, meetings with foreign leaders and his White House renovations.\n\nIt also served as a reminder that Trump's supporters don't necessarily vote when he is not on the ballot, a problem Republicans will have to confront again next year.\n\nTrump's reaction also underscored that he may not be Republicans' most helpful midterm messenger. This week, he declared on social media that \"the Democrats 'affordability' issue is dead,\" even as his advisers acknowledged the need to focus more on lower prices.\n\nOther Republicans warned voters could punish the party again if leaders downplay their concerns.\n\n\"There is an affordability issue,\" said Rep. Don Bacon, a Nebraska Republican who is not running for reelection. \"Gas prices are down, but most people at the supermarket aren't seeing any improvement.\"\n\nRecent polls show an unhappy electorate, an encouraging sign for Democrats' chances to win back the narrowly divided House of Representatives. Trump's approval rating stood at 37% and his disapproval at 63%, according to a CNN poll released this week. Surveys also show Democratic voters are more energized than Republicans heading into the midterms.\n\n\"The Democratic Party is full steam ahead to take back Congress next year,\" Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin said this week on a call with reporters.\n\nThe government shutdown is also driving public frustration, as federal workers miss paychecks, food aid is delayed and flights have been canceled. Polling shows Republicans are shouldering more of the blame, but Trump has refused to meet with Democrats to negotiate a compromise. Instead, he has called on Republicans to abolish the filibuster to reopen the government, despite leaders' insistence they lack the votes.\n\nStill, Trump allies argue he has some clear advantages going into 2026 that he did not have in 2018. He has consolidated Republicans around his agenda, Democratic opposition still has not matched the energy following Trump's surprise 2016 win and he has raised immense sums of money through Trump-associated political action committees.\n\nSome Republicans also said that this week's results weren't representative of the country as a whole because they largely came in Democratic states and their party was plagued by weak candidates.\n\nThe GOP-aligned Senate Leadership Fund sent a memo to donors, reviewed by Bloomberg News, which argued that while Democrats did better than expected this week, they over-performed in Democratic states that Trump lost in 2024. Looking ahead to the midterms, it said that Senate Republicans have winning candidates in Trump-won states and that they are in a strong position to hold the chamber.\n\nTrump took a relatively hands-off approach to this year's contests. He did not campaign in person in New Jersey or Virginia with Republican gubernatorial candidates, instead opting for virtual rallies. Trump's vocal opposition to democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani helped fuel his winning campaign for New York City mayor, though the president's party is also poised to use the mayor-elect as a foil.\n\n\"The decision facing all Americans could not be more clear. We have a choice between communism and common sense,\" Trump said Wednesday at an event in Miami.\n\nOne of the ways Trump has worked to bolster his party's standing in 2026 is to trigger a redistricting arms race between red and blue states. Texas Republicans redrew their state's map to add five GOP-leaning seats outside of the typical once-a-decade cycle. In response, California Gov. Gavin Newsom got voters to approve a map that could net Democrats five seats there, enough to counter Texas' changes.\n\nTrump has also urged other Republican-controlled states, including Missouri and Indiana, to follow Texas' lead. That has energized Democrats to jump into the fight. Former President Barack Obama, among the party's most popular figures, denounced the GOP maneuvers as an \"existential threat\" to American democracy.\n\nTrump has also returned to a long-running fixation, mail-in voting, promising an executive order curbing the now-common practice. He has long made unsubstantiated allegations that his 2020 election loss to Joe Biden was tainted by fraudulent ballots.\n\nPeter Loge, director of the School of Media and Public Affairs at George Washington University, said that traveling to promote legislation is standard politicking but Trump is aiming for something more.\n\n\"One way you win a game is trying to change the rules to favor your side,\" he said.",

        "title": "Democrats seize on Trump administration's efforts to fight food stamp payments",
        "description": "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- The Trump administration's legal efforts to fight having to fully fund food stamps for millions of vulnerable Americans is creating an opening for Democrats eager to use the longest government shutdown in U.S. history to paint the president as callous and out of touch.\n\n\"Donald Trump and his administration have made the decision to weaponize hunger, to withhold SNAP benefits from millions of people, notwithstanding the fact that two lower courts, both the district court and the court of appeals, made clear that those SNAP benefits needed to be paid immediately,\" House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries said on CNN Saturday, calling the actions \"shameful.\"\n\n\"Donald Trump is literally fighting in court to ensure Americans starve. HE DOES NOT CARE ABOUT YOU,\" echoed California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a potential 2028 presidential contender, on X.\n\nThe comments come after the Supreme Court late Friday granted the administration's emergency appeal to temporarily block a court order requiring it to fully fund SNAP food aid payments amid the shutdown. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program serves about 1 in 8 Americans, mostly those with lower incomes.\n\nA judge had given the administration until Friday to make the payments. But the administration asked an appeals court to suspend any orders requiring it to spend more money than is available in a contingency fund, and to move forward with planned partial SNAP payments for the month instead.\n\nThe legal wrangling comes after the administration and Republicans endured a bruising Election Day last week. Democrats scored commanding wins up and down the ballot and on ballot measures across the country amid signs that voters' economic woes are top of mind - a warning sign for the president and his party heading into next year's higher-stakes midterm elections.\n\nIn response, the White House is planning to adjust its messaging strategy to focus on affordability to try to win over voters who are worried about the high cost of living with plans to emphasize new tax breaks and show progress on fighting inflation.\n\nBut its efforts around food stamps could complicate that.\n\nBoth parties have tried to blame the other for the shutdown as its impact has spread beyond Washington, D.C., including a growing crisis at the nation's airports.\n\nAn Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll conducted in October, as the shutdown stretched into its third week, found that roughly 6 in 10 Americans said Trump and Republicans in Congress bore \"a great deal\" or \"quite a bit\" of responsibility for the shutdown, while 54% said the same about Democrats in Congress. At least three-quarters said both sides deserved at least a \"moderate\" share of blame.\n\nThe White House did not respond to questions Saturday about its rationale for appealing the SNAP orders to the Supreme Court or whether it was concerned about the optics of fighting against making the full payments.\n\nAgriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, appearing on Fox News, again blamed Democrats for refusing to vote to reopen the government and made the case that funding had to come from Congress.\n\n\"We can't just create money out of the sky,\" she said. \"You can't just create money to fund a program that Congress refuses to fund.\"\n\nWhile hundreds of thousands of federal workers have been furloughed and gone over a month without paychecks, the president has gone out of his way to ensure those he favors have been paid.\n\nThat includes members of the military after Trump directed the Pentagon to use \"all available funds\" to pay U.S. troops.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has said her department had found a way to pay the U.S. Coast Guard and law enforcement officers within the department, including border patrol agents and immigration officers with funds from the sweeping \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act\" Trump signed this summer.\n\nAnd FBI director Kash Patel has said that FBI special agents are still being paid - though other bureau workers are not. The administration has not said where that money is coming from.\n\nTrump has repeatedly voiced skepticism about SNAP, and he and the White House have offered conflicting messages on what would happen to the program during the shutdown.\n\nIn a social media post Tuesday, Trump announced that the administration would not pay out any SNAP benefits until the shutdown was over, and suggested that some who receive benefits are not really in need.\n\nHours later, however, press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the administration would pay out partial SNAP benefits using contingency funding \"that is supposed to be for emergencies, catastrophes, for war.\"\n\nBut when asked Thursday about a judge ordering the administration to make the full payment, the president directed Vice President JD Vance, who was sitting next to him, to answer.\n\nVance called the ruling \"absurd,\" because, he said, \"you have a federal judge effectively telling us what we have to do in the midst of a Democrat government shutdown.\"\"\n\n\"In the midst of a shutdown, we can't have a federal court telling the president how he has to triage the situation,\" he said.\n\nTrump added that he believes the country \"has to remain very liquid because problems, catastrophes, wars, could be anything. We have to remain liquid. We can't give everything away.\"\n\nThe administration has faced lawsuits from Democratic-leaning states, nonprofits and cities since shortly after announcing that SNAP benefits would not be available in November because of the shutdown.\n\nBut two judges separately ordered the government to keep the money following, ruling last week that the administration could not skip November's benefits entirely. In both cases, the judges ordered the government to use an emergency reserve fund containing more than $4.6 billion to make the payments, which cost between $8.5 billion and $9 billion each month.\n\nAfter the administration announced it would cover only 65% of the maximum monthly benefit, one judge ruled that they could not and would need to find the money to fully fund the program for November.\n\nThe Justice Department filed an emergency appeal. In its court filings Friday, the administration contended that the judge had usurped both legislative and executive authority. When a higher court refused to nullify the Friday payment deadline, the Trump administration turned quickly to the Supreme Court.\n\nThrough an order signed by liberal Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, the high court agreed to keep the full-payment order on hold until 48 hours after the appeals court rules on whether to issue a more lasting pause. Jackson, a frequent dissenter from a series of recent decisions in favor of the administration, is the justice assigned to oversee appeals from Rhode Island, where the case originated.\n\nThe legal wrangling has left millions of Americans who depend on food aid in confusing limbo. People in some states have reported receiving their full benefits for November, while others could be waiting until at least next week.",

        "title": "Trump has threatened to punish NYC over Mamdani. How does the mayor-elect fight back?",
        "description": "After winning the New York City mayoral race, Zohran Mamdani had just four words for President Donald Trump.\n\nNEW YORK - New York's mayor-elect, Zohran Mamdani, said on Nov. 5 the city's residents were facing twin crises.\n\nThere was affordability, the 34-year-old democratic socialist said in his first news conference since winning the election the night before. Then there was what he called \"an authoritarian administration\" under President Donald Trump.\n\n\"It'll be my job to deliver on both,\" Mamdani said. \"It will be my job to stand up for the city.\"\n\nTrump, a Queens native, has loomed over the election in his hometown, and he has threatened to punish New York with measures such as cutting the city's funds if voters elected Mamdani, a state assemblyman from Queens. If Mamdani became mayor, Trump recently said it would be hard for him to give \"a lot of money\" to New York, adding Mamdani would waste the money with his left-leaning politics.\n\nMamdani has vowed to fight back in court when he takes office in January.\n\nHere's a rundown of what Trump could do to the nation's largest city, and what Mamdani can do in response to - as his campaign platform promised - \"Trump-proof\" New York.\n\nDeploy National Guard\n\nIn contrast to some of the other largest cities such as Los Angeles and Chicago, New York has been untouched by the Trump administration's deployment of National Guard. Trump could try deploying troops to city streets.\n\nGov. Kathy Hochul, a moderate Democrat, has had National Guard at subway stations to reduce transit crime, but has reportedly been preparing to push back on Trump deploying troops into the city.\n\nLame-duck Mayor Eric Adams forged a bond with Trump after the Justice Department dropped federal corruption charges against Adams so he could help with Trump's immigration crackdown.\n\nIn contrast, Mamdani has discussed forming a coalition with state officials, including Trump's nemesis, New York Attorney General Letitia James, to sue the federal government if troops get sent. He's cited the success by LA Mayor Karen Bass and Gov. Gavin Newsom in lawsuits that blocked Trump's National Guard deployment in California.\n\nLarge-scale immigration raids\n\nOther Democratic cities such as Chicago, LA and Boston have seen sweeping immigration raids on streets, construction sites and businesses.\n\nNew York had highly publicized immigration enforcement operations shortly after Trump's return to office, but has not had the same scale of enforcement. There was a recent chaotic immigration raid by federal agents on street vendors allegedly selling counterfeit merchandise in lower Manhattan.\n\nFederal agents have targeted people attending immigration court or Immigration and Customs Enforcement check-ins at a Manhattan federal building. The federal actions have sometimes resulted in violence against migrants, including one woman thrown to the ground by an agent.\n\nMamdani said he'd hold federal agents carrying out Trump's immigration enforcement to the same legal standard as anyone else, implying that ICE agents could be arrested for assaulting New Yorkers.\n\n\"If you violate the law, you must be held accountable,\" he said. \"And there is sadly a sense that is growing across this country that certain people are allowed to violate that law, whether they be the president or whether they be the agents themselves.\"\n\nMamdani has vowed to make New York the nation's strongest sanctuary city, which broadly means limiting local cooperation with federal immigration enforcement.\n\nMamdani has also called to invest $165 million to fund immigration legal defense services. He's said his administration would survey every city system to protect sensitive data of undocumented people and others.\n\nBehind the scenes, state officials and business leaders are reportedly trying to prevent raids. San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie in October successfully persuaded the Trump administration not to conduct enforcement in the California city.\n\nCut federal funds to NYC\n\nEarly in Trump's second term, Elon Musk's so-called Department of Government Efficiency revoked $80 million in Federal Emergency Management Agency funds. Adams' City Hall has sued the administration for the funding.\n\nMonths later, the federal Department of Transportation said it was halting funds to the nation's largest infrastructure project, which would bolster the busiest U.S. rail corridor underneath the Hudson River between New Jersey and Manhattan, as well as the Second Avenue Subway, also in Manhattan. Withholding about $18 billion, federal officials cited the New York City's Disadvantaged Business Enterprise program, an equity initiative meant to expand participation by racial minorities in federally assisted contracts.\n\nTrump has threatened to slash even more federal funds to the city if Mamdani was elected. In a Nov. 3 Truth Social post, Trump said, \"it is highly unlikely that I will be contributing Federal Funds, other than the very minimum as required, to my beloved first home.\"\n\nLike other Democratic cities and states that have faced cuts to federal benefits, Mamdani has said the city could mount legal challenges to the cuts to recoup lost funds. Some cities and states have seen some success, such as Fresno, California, and North Carolina.\n\nArrest America's mayor\n\nEven before Mamdani won the mayoralty, Trump suggested arresting Mamdani and stripping him of his citizenship if Mamdani didn't assist on federal immigration enforcement. Mamdani, born in Uganda, moved to the United States as a child and was raised in Manhattan's Morningside Heights. He became a naturalized citizen in 2018.\n\nSome right-wing members of Trump's party have called to review Mamdani's citizenship process in an effort to denaturalize and deport him. Trump has threatened to arrest Democratic elected officials before.\n\nAfter Mamdani won the election on Nov. 4, he spoke directly to Trump.\n\n\"New York will remain a city of immigrants, a city built by immigrants, powered by immigrants, and as of tonight, led by an immigrant,\" he said. \"So, hear me, President Trump, when I say this: To get to any of us, you will have to get through all of us.\"\n\nMamdani's line drew perhaps the loudest roar throughout the night.\n\nEduardo Cuevas is based in New York City.

        "title": "Newsom set to rally Texas Dems with victory lap days after Prop 50 passes: 'California stepped up'",
        "description": "A newly emboldened Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom is taking his show on the road.\n\nFour days after spearheading a ballot box landslide victory in his home state of California in the high-stakes battle over congressional redistricting, the two-term governor and potential 2028 Democratic presidential contender will headline a rally Saturday in Republican-leaning Texas.\n\nNewsom was the driving force behind Tuesday's passage of Proposition 50, a ballot initiative which will temporarily sidetrack Democratic-leaning California's nonpartisan redistricting commission and return the power to draw the congressional maps to the Democrat-dominated legislature.\n\nThat is expected to result in five more Democratic-leaning congressional districts in California, which would counter the passage earlier this year in the reliable red state of Texas of a new map that aims to create up to five right-leaning House seats.\n\nNEWSOM SCORES MAJOR BALLOT BOX VICTORY ON ELECTION NIGHT 2025\n\n\"California stepped up. Now, we are taking this fight across the country -- helping Democrats in other states push back against Trump's election rigging,\" Newsom said in a statement to Fox News Digital, as he pointed to the push by President Donald Trump and Republicans for rare mid-decade redistricting.\n\nIt's part of a broad effort by Trump's political team and the GOP to pad the party's razor-thin House majority to keep control of the chamber in the 2026 midterms when the party in power traditionally faces political headwinds and loses seats. Missouri, North Carolina, and Ohio have drawn new maps as part of the president's push.\n\nHEAD HERE FOR THE LATEST FOX NEWS REPORTING, ANALYSIS, AND OPINION ON GAVIN NEWSOM\n\nTrump is aiming to prevent what happened during his first term in the White House when Democrats reclaimed the House majority in the 2018 midterm elections.\n\nFailure to approve what's known as Proposition 50 would have been a stinging setback for Democrats.\n\nBut Newsom was victorious and now has a message for fellow Democrats from coast to coast.\n\n\"We need to see other states, their remarkable leaders that have been doing remarkable things, meet this moment head-on as well,\" he said on Tuesday night as he celebrated passage of the ballot initiative. \"We can de facto end Donald Trump's presidency as we know it, the minute Speaker Jeffries gets sworn in as speaker of the House of Representatives. It is all on the line.\"\n\nNewsom is expected to rally with Texas Democrats at an afternoon event in Houston.\n\nWhile two other Democratic blue state governors with likely national ambitions in 2028, JB Pritzker of Illinois and Wes Moore of Maryland, are mulling new maps in their states to create one or two more blue-leaning congressional districts, Newsom has been the most visible leader so far in the redistricting wars and the first Democrat to succeed.\n\nAnd the campaign for Prop 50 passage only burnished Newsom's already solid credentials as an anti-Trump warrior, which could pay dividends for him down the road in what's expected to be a crowded and competitive 2028 Democratic presidential nomination race.\n\nCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"He put a lot of effort into this, and it was not a sure thing when it first started,\" veteran Democratic strategist Maria Cardona told Fox News Digital. \"He galvanized and mobilized California voters.\"\n\nAnd Cardona, a committee member on the Democratic National Committee, said, \"I certainly think it burnished Gavin Newsom's brand not just as the anti-Trump, but right now I think it puts him as one of the leaders in contention for 2028.\"",

And burn through those funds, she did,\n\nIt is hard to imagine a President Harris dealing with dictators like Communist China's Xi Jinping, war criminal Vladimir Putin of Russia or defiant Chuck Schumer of New York.\n\nIt is doubtful that she would have sent the B-2 bombers to wipe out the nuclear facilities in Iran or done much to free the Israelis held hostage by the Hamas terrorists in Gaza.\n\nWith Harris in the White House, John Kerry would have been back as climate czar, Maura Healey would be U.S. attorney general, and Elizabeth Warren would be Secretary of State.\n\nThe border would be open with Gavin Newsom in charge, people being deported would be Republicans, and Venezuelan dictator Nicolas Maduro would be bombing U.S vessels and not the other way around.\n\nUnder President Donald Trump, however, Maduro, if he is lucky, will soon be back driving a bus or die in prison, like fellow drug kingpin Manuel Noriega of Panama after the U.S. invaded and arrested him.\n\nAnd the East Wing of the White House that Trump is turning into a ballroom?\n\nForget about it. President Harris would have turned it into a Washington food pantry.\n\nIf you think not, consider her quote about the ballroom last week. She said, \"Are you f -- -g kidding me? The guy wants to create a ballroom for his rich friends while turning a blind eye to the fact that babies are going to starve when the SNAP benefits end hours from now. Come on.\"\n\nNobody is going to starve in the U.S., and everybody knows it.\n\nAnd can you imagine President Harris ending wars around the globe the way Trump has done?\n\nTrump has settled so many wars between countries that he has lost count. He has even brought peace to countries that did not even know they were at war.\n\nSo, with the defeat of Harris, the country dodged a bullet.\n\nStill, Harris is hanging in there hoping that lightning will strike twice and that she will once again be the Democrat Party nominee for president in 2028. Fat chance.\n\nThe difference now is that this time she will have to fight for the Democrat nomination instead of being crowned by the party as she was in 2024 after Joe Biden melted down.\n\nHarris, however, will now face a wave of new, ambitious, young radical leftists like Andrea Ocasio-Cortez (AOC) or Zohran Mamdani (ZM) for instance, who have taken over the leadership of the Democrat Party\n\nMeanwhile, Harris still has old Joe Biden hanging around her neck like an ex-husband who won't leave the house.\n\nStill, Harris is trying, and says she is not finished with politics, which is interpreted as that she will run again, or at least try.\n\nAnd she has remained in the spotlight not by campaigning for any candidate the way Barack Obama did, but by peddling her book.\n\nWhile stiffing the media in 2024 -- and paying the price for it -- Harris has now done interviews with more reporters promoting her book \"107 Days\" than she did during the entire 107 days of her presidential campaign.\n\nAnd she's only been on her book-selling tour for 40 days.\n\nShe apparently thought that the $1.5 billion she spent on her campaign would do the trick. It did not\n\nHarris spent the entire 107 days of her 2024 presidential campaign without holding a single official press conference, which must be something of a record.\n\nNow she loves the media, and reporters have to beat her off with a stick.",

        "description": "Becket Fund counsel Jordan Varberg discusses the settlement agreement UCLA has agreed to over anti-Israel protests and antisemitism on 'Fox Report.'\n\nCornell Law professor William A. Jacobson, founder of the Equal Protection Project, has filed a federal civil rights complaint with the U.S. Department of Education's civil rights office accusing the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) of running more than a dozen scholarships that exclude students based on race, sex or national origin.\n\nThe 13 programs named in the complaint include awards limited to \"LatinX\" freshmen, \"Pilipinx\" students, \"undocumented undergraduates,\" and female-only applicants. The filing claims those criteria violate Title VI and Title IX of federal civil-rights law, which bar discrimination by federally funded schools.\n\n\"That race- and sex-based discriminatory scholarships exist at a major and highly visible public university is shocking,\" Jacobson told Fox News Digital. \"UCLA should know better than to run scholarships or programs that treat students differently based on race, color, national origin, or sex.\"\n\nUC BERKELEY CLASS FOCUSES ON HOW 'RACIAL SUPERIORITY' SHAPES IMMIGRATION LAW, ANTI-ICE RHETORIC\n\nThe UCLA Latino Alumni Association scholarship states it was created for \"incoming LatinX freshmen and transfer students,\" while a Pilipino Alumni Association award is for students \"who indicate their membership in the Pilipinx community.\" The Undocumented Alumni Association Scholarship restricts eligibility to undocumented students, and the Raza Women's Alumni Scholarship gives preference to \"incoming Latina freshmen and transfer students.\"\n\nThat language stands in contrast to remarks by California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who said earlier this year that \"no one says Latinx.\" Despite the governor's disavowal of the term, UCLA, part of the UC system he oversees, still uses \"LatinX\" as an official eligibility label in a taxpayer-funded scholarship.\n\nOther programs cited include two scholarships for students of Armenian descent and a Deloitte Foundation award that supports \"meritorious female students.\" The complaint argues that UCLA's use of racial or sex-based criteria \"violates federal law and the university's own nondiscrimination policies.\"\n\nThe filing asks federal officials to investigate and, if necessary, suspend UCLA's federal funding until the programs are changed.\n\nUCLA's scholarship portal contains a statement defending its process for \"identity-conscious\" awards.\n\nELITE CALIFORNIA COLLEGES FACE TITLE VI COMPLAINT OVER DEI-LINKED SCHOLARSHIPS\n\n\"UCLA administers all identity-conscious financial aid and scholarships in compliance with federal, state, and university regulations,\" the statement says. \"Identity-conscious awards may include a preference for a student's race, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, color, ethnicity, or national origin... The pooled application process allows students to be considered for multiple scholarships and is used in determining the source of a recipient's aid, but not their eligibility, receipt, or amount of financial aid.\"\n\nJacobson said UCLA's policies still cross a legal line.\n\n\"Creating educational opportunities based on race, color, national origin, or sex violates Titles VI and IX of the Civil Rights Act,\" he said. \"It's time for higher education to focus on the inherent worth of every student rather than categorizing them by identity groups.\"\n\nThe complaint, filed Nov. 7, 2025, asks the Education Department to open a formal investigation and enforce compliance with federal law.\n\nCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nUCLA and Newsom's office have not yet responded to Fox News Digital's request for comment.",

        "title": "Trump admin asks Supreme Court to halt order providing full SNAP...",
        "description": "Residents in some U.S. states began to receive their full SNAP food aid Friday as an appeals court left in place, for now, an order requiring President Donald Trump's administration to fund such benefits amid a U.S. government shutdown.\n\nA judge had given the Republican administration until Friday to make the payments through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. But the administration asked the appeals court to suspend any court orders requiring it to spend more money than is available in a contingency fund, and instead allow it to continue with planned partial SNAP payments for the month.\n\nAfter the appeals court declined to do so, the Trump administration quickly asked the U.S. Supreme Court to take up its request.\n\nThe food program serves about 1 in 8 Americans, mostly with lower incomes.\n\nOfficials in at least a half-dozen states confirmed that some SNAP recipients already were issued full November payments on Friday.\n\n\"Food benefits are now beginning to flow back to California families,\" Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a statement.\n\nIn Wisconsin, more than $104 million of monthly food benefits became available at midnight on electronic cards for about 337,000 households, a spokesperson for Democratic Gov. Tony Evers said. The state was able to access the federal money so quickly by submitting a request to its electronic benefit card vendor to process the SNAP payments within hours of a Thursday court order to provide full benefits.\n\nOregon Gov. Tina Kotek, a Democrat, said state employees \"worked through the night\" to issue full November benefits \"to make sure every Oregon family relying on SNAP could buy groceries\" by Friday.\n\nOfficials in Kansas, New Jersey and Pennsylvania also said they moved quickly to issue full SNAP benefits Friday, while other states said they expected full benefits to arrive over the weekend or early next week. Still others said they were waiting for further federal guidance.\n\nThe court wrangling prolonged weeks of uncertainty for Americans with lower incomes.\n\nAn individual can receive a monthly maximum food benefit of nearly $300 and a family of four up to nearly $1,000, although many receive less than that under a formula that takes into consideration their income.\n\nFor some SNAP participants, it remained unclear when they would receive their benefits.\n\nJasmen Youngbey of Newark, New Jersey, waited in line Friday at a food pantry in the state's largest city. As a single mom attending college, Youngbey said she relies on SNAP to help feed her 7-month-old and 4-year-old sons. But she said her account balance was at $0.\n\n\"Not everybody has cash to pull out and say, 'OK, I'm going to go and get this,' especially with the cost of food right now,\" she said.\n\nLater Friday, Youngbey said, she received her monthly SNAP benefits.\n\nTihinna Franklin, a school bus guard who was waiting in the same line outside the United Community Corporation food pantry, said her SNAP account balance was at 9 cents and she was down to three items in her freezer. She typically relies on the roughly $290 a month in SNAP benefits to help feed her grandchildren.\n\n\"If I don't get it, I won't be eating,\" she said. \"My money I get paid for, that goes to the bills, rent, electricity, personal items. That is not fair to us as mothers and caregivers.\"\n\nFranklin said later Friday that she had received at least some of her normal SNAP benefits.\n\nBecause of the federal government shutdown, the Trump administration originally had said SNAP benefits would not be available in November. However, two judges ruled last week that the administration could not skip November's benefits entirely because of the shutdown. One of those judges was U.S. District Judge John J. McConnell Jr., who ordered the full payments Thursday.\n\nIn both cases, the judges ordered the government to use one emergency reserve fund containing more than $4.6 billion to pay for SNAP for November but gave it leeway to tap other money to make the full payments, which cost between $8.5 billion and $9 billion each month.\n\nOn Monday, the administration said it would not use additional money, saying it was up to Congress to appropriate the funds for the program and that the other money was needed to shore up other child hunger programs.\n\nThursday's federal court order rejected the Trump administration's decision to cover only 65% of the maximum monthly benefit, a decision that could have left some recipients getting nothing for this month.\n\nIn its court filing Friday, Trump's administration contended that Thursday's directive to fund full SNAP benefits runs afoul of the U.S. Constitution.\n\n\"This unprecedented injunction makes a mockery of the separation of powers. Courts hold neither the power to appropriate nor the power to spend,\" the U.S. Department of Justice wrote in its request to the court.\n\nIn response, attorneys for the cities and nonprofits challenging Trump's administration said the government has plenty of available money and the court should \"not allow them to further delay getting vital food assistance to individuals and families who need it now.\"\n\nSome states said they stood ready to distribute SNAP money as quickly as possible.\n\nMassachusetts said SNAP recipients should receive their full November payments as soon as Saturday. New York said access to full SNAP benefits should begin by Sunday. New Hampshire said full benefits should be available by this weekend. And Connecticut said full benefits should be accessible in the next several days.\n\nOfficials in North Carolina said they distributed partial SNAP payments Friday and full benefits could be available by this weekend. Officials in Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana and North Dakota also said they distributed partial November payments.\n\nAmid the federal uncertainty, Delaware's Democratic Gov. Matt Meyer said the state used its own funds Friday to provide the first of what could be a weekly relief payment to SNAP recipients.",

        "title": "This North Carolina Democrat can't win her district. So she's running as a Republican.",
        "description": "North Carolina Democrat Kate Barr announced today that she's running for Congress as a Republican. Her reason for the switch: Gerrymandering. (Video: Sean Carter, Reena Flores, Laura Benshoff, Savannah Robinson, Joshua Carroll, Colby Itkowitz/The Washington Post)\n\nWhen Kate Barr ran for a state senate seat in North Carolina last year, she pitched herself to voters as a \"loser.\"\n\nNow, Barr has declared her bid for Congress. This time, she says she could actually win.\n\nThe difference? She's running as a Republican.\n\nBarr, a 43-year-old lifelong Democrat, has changed her party registration to run in the GOP primary against incumbent Rep. Tim Moore, who represents North Carolina's 14th congressional district. She says it's the only way to compete for a gerrymandered seat whose boundaries were drawn to heavily favor Republicans.\n\nBarr sat down with The Washington Post's Post Reports podcast to explain why this time she decided to switch parties and compete in a primary race.\n\n\"My message is really about fairness. And it's consistent with when I ran for state senate in '24,\" she said. \"We need fair maps. We deserve fair elections. We, as voters, should be able to hold our elected leaders accountable. And it is wrong that we can't.\"\n\nThe odds still aren't great for Barr. Moore has local name recognition after more than 20 years in the state House, including 10 as speaker. He's also actually a Republican in a Republican primary. Barr is not and does not plan to pretend she is beyond the \"R\" next to her name on the ballot.\n\nJordan Shaw, a Moore campaign adviser, dismissed Barr's challenge.\n\n\"All I know about this person is what I found in 15 seconds on her website: that she's a far-left liberal. Good luck selling that to GOP voters,\" he said.\n\nBut 38 percent of the district's voters are registered as unaffiliated, meaning they can vote in either party's primary. Barr says that makes this electoral quest more achievable than trying to run in a general election as a Democrat in a district with a predetermined outcome.\n\nBarr ran her first race in 2024 singularly focused on raising awareness about gerrymandering, the overtly partisan practice of drawing election maps to benefit one political party. Davidson, the small college town north of Charlotte where she lives, shares a district with mostly rural, conservative areas to the west that make it effectively impossible for a Democrat to compete there.\n\nAs she predicted, despite running an all-out campaign with yard signs and door knocking and events, she lost that race handily by nearly 30 percentage points.\n\nBarr's focus on gerrymandering also comes at a moment when the Democratic Party has chosen to embrace the practice in response to President Donald Trump's calls for Republicans to redraw congressional maps in red states to increase the chances of keeping the U.S. House majority in next year's midterms. This week, California voters overwhelmingly supported a plan put forward by Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) to redraw its maps to gain more Democratic seats in hopes of staving off Republican gains elsewhere.\n\nBarr, who has become an evangelist to end gerrymandering, said she is conflicted about her party's strategy. She thinks hers is better.\n\n\"I understand why the Democratic Party feels like their response needs to look like gerrymandering in return,\" she said. \"This is a losing race to the bottom, and it's horrifying to me. Something I feel excited about in this approach to running is that instead of using voter suppression tactics to try to fight back against gerrymandered maps, we're actually offering voters more power.\"\n\nLaura Benshoff, Sabby Robinson, Reena Flores, Scott Clement and Lenny Broner contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Rama Duwaji, illustrating her own life, is more than Zohran Mamdani's wife",
        "description": "Zohran Mamdani wins NYC mayor's race\n\nMamdani, 34, will be NYC's first Muslim and South Asian mayor.\n\nIn the photo posted to Instagram, Rawa Duwaji makes a heart with her two hands.\n\nHer husband Zohran Mamdani - the mayor-elect of New York City - is touching her right arm as he smiles. Two people are hugging. Another woman is soft smiling. And in the intimate pictures taken by Sinna Nasseri from Election Day, Duwaji is making her own gesture, a symbolic nod to her approach as a political spouse.\n\nThe artist and illustrator Duwaji has resisted the confines of political marriages in the months leading up to Mamdani's win Nov. 4 and its aftermath. She did not participate in interviews or stand alongside Mamdani on the campaign trail as he blitzed across five boroughs in the nation's largest city.\n\nMamdani, a democratic socialist, and Duwaji both represent a shift in American politics. Duwaji though is a visible part of a growing trend among women married to politicians, speaking how and when and where they want to.\n\nFirst Lady Melania Trump also rarely sits for interviews and during her husband's second term, she has kept a lighter calendar, focusing on her life as a mom to college-aged Barron Trump. Gov. Gavin Newsom - buzzed about as a potential Democratic contender for president in 2028 - is married to filmmaker Jennifer Siebel Newsom, who reimagined her role as \"first partner\" (instead of lady) due to gendered stereotypes.\n\nAnd while promoting her \"Look\" book this week about fashion, former first lady Michelle Obama opened up about the perils of a life in the White House.\n\nA native of Texas, Mamdani's campaign told The New York Times in June that Duwaji obtained a master's degree in illustration from the School of Visual Arts in New York.\n\nZohran Mamdani, Rama Duwaji met on Hinge\n\nThe duo met on the dating app Hinge, a rival to Tinder and Bumble. \"I met my wife on Hinge so there is still hope in those dating apps,\" Mamdani said on The Bulwark podcast in June. Duwaji is accomplished in her own right and according to her website, her work has been featured in The New Yorker and The Washington Post and other includes Apple and Spotify\n\nAfter online speculation arose that he was shielding his wife or hiding her, Mamdani - ever a savvy politician - responded with a social media post May 12. In the wedding photos, the happy couple is laughing on a sidewalk underneath an umbrella, Duwaji holds a bouquet on the subway and in all the others, they look smitten.\n\n\"If you take a look at Twitter today, or any day for that matter, you know how vicious politics can be. I usually brush it off, whether it's death threats or calls for me to be deported,\" he wrote. \"But it's different when it's about those you love.\"Then, Mamdani explained that three months earlier, he married Duwaji - the \"love of my life\" - at the City Clerk's office. \"Now, right-wing trolls are trying to make this race -- which should be about you -- about her,\" he continued.\"Rama isn't just my wife, she's an incredible artist who deserves to be known on her own terms,\" Duwaji said. \"You can critique my views, but not my family.\"\n\nOn Election Day, Mamdani and Duwaji headed to their polling place in Astoria, Queens to cast their votes. They held hands. During media interviews, she remained silent.\n\nAfter her husband won the race to replace embattled Mayor Eric Adams, she stood on stage in a chic all-black outfit at his victory party on election night. She wore a chic black top and a matching lace-and-velvet skirt. But Duwaji didn't speak publicly.\n\nInstead, she posted a black-and-white illustration of a skyline, made with her own two hands, to Instagram on Nov. 6 with the words \"I LOVE U NYC.\" \"So proud to be a part of this city,\" she captioned this post.\n\nA woman with a statement of her own. Maybe Mamdani is right: Duwaji is illustrating her own life and so she doesn't need someone else's microphone to make her voice, or herself, known.",

        "title": "California Fire Victims Urge State to Hold Insurers Accountable",
        "description": "\"We thought we could trust the system,\" said a homeowner in Altadena whose insurance policy was canceled only months before the January fires destroyed his home.\n\nBranislav Kecman was one of roughly 50,000 Californians who lost their homeowners insurance coverage in the months before the fires that swept through the Los Angeles area in January, dropped by State Farm because his house was too high a risk. His home in the community of Altadena was destroyed in the blaze, and he was left facing a series of hard financial choices.\n\nWith only the coverage offered by the state's last-resort insurance plan, Mr. Kecman estimates that he will receive about $1 million, only enough to build a house about a third smaller than the one he lost. The cost to insure the new structure is likely to be much higher, too, now that carriers are asking for rate increases to offset rising wildfire risks.\n\nMr. Kecman is among the thousands of Californians affected by the fires who say a broken insurance market is hampering their ability to rebuild their lives. On Thursday, many of them gathered in Altadena to urge Gov. Gavin Newsom to install a new insurance commissioner, require insurers to pay outstanding claims and ensure that consumers are protected as companies raise premiums.\n\n\"We thought we could trust the system,\" Mr. Kecman, a 64-year-old electrical engineer, said at a news conference organized by the Eaton Fire Survivors Network.\n\nMr. Kecman said he had found it encouraging that Ricardo Lara, the state insurance commissioner, had drafted new regulations not long before the fires that would require carriers to write policies in risky parts of the state in exchange for higher rates. But he and others cited a New York Times story from last week that revealed how a series of loopholes could allow insurers to qualify to charge the higher rates merely by writing new policies in the areas where they had recently dumped customers like him.\n\nThe investigation found that there were no guarantees that a substantial number of new policies would be written in the state's high-risk fire areas.\n\n\"I understand that agencies don't always live up to the idea that they serve the best interests of the people,\" Mr. Kecman said in an interview. \"But I felt gut-punched when I found out.\"\n\nAfter the Times story was published, Mr. Lara said that his department knew that insurance companies and others would try to find and exploit loopholes. \"This is not a surprise to anyone that has dealt with them,\" Mr. Lara said in a statement. \"If it is, welcome to Earth. All eyes are on insurance companies, including mine and The New York Times.\"\n\nMichael Soller, California's deputy insurance commissioner, said the regulations allowing insurers to charge higher rates, called the Sustainable Insurance Strategy, had been open to public scrutiny for more than a year. \"Last time I checked, a hearing room is not a backroom,\" he said.\n\n\"Commissioner Lara has moved quickly and decisively to respond to the fires, including using every tool available to ensure wildfire survivors receive all the benefits they are entitled to under current law,\" Mr. Soller said.\n\nHe added that the department had told insurers to fully investigate and pay legitimate smoke damage claims and had recovered more than $135 million for wildfire survivors. He said that insurance companies had paid more than $20 billion on more than 41,800 claims, with 92 percent of claims fully paid or underway.\n\nMr. Newsom's office did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nJoy Chen, the head of the Eaton Fire Survivors Network, said on Thursday that homeowners wanted Mr. Newsom to enforce consumer protection laws and build a functioning insurance system.\n\nMore than eight out of 10 of those whose homes were destroyed by the fires in Altadena and the Pacific Palisades section of Los Angeles are still displaced, and 70 percent of insured Eaton and Palisades survivors have faced delays in receiving insurance payments or denials of coverage, according to data from the Department of Angels, a nonprofit created after the Los Angeles fires to help with the recovery effort.\n\n\"Our entire housing market will collapse if families can't buy or renew insurance, and if those who have it can't get the benefits they've paid for,\" Ms. Chen said.\n\nCarmel Kadrnka, a physician from Pacific Palisades who watched Thursday's event online, said that State Farm had dropped her fire coverage in August 2024, five months before the fire destroyed her home. Like Mr. Kecman, she was put on the FAIR plan, the state's fire insurer of last resort, and had to buy additional property insurance to cover other liabilities like water damage and vandalism.\n\nBefore Ms. Kadrnka was dumped by State Farm, she paid about $20,000 a year in premiums for about $7 million worth of coverage on her home and adjacent structures, personal property and living expenses if she could not live in her house.\n\nAfter she lost that policy, she paid around $27,000 a year for her FAIR plan fire policy and additional State Farm property insurance, but her coverage was capped at $3 million. Now that she has lost her home, she does not have enough coverage to replace her house and her personal belongings, not to mention renting a temporary home in one of the nation's most expensive markets.\n\n\"No one can tell us whether we'll even be able to get coverage in the future,\" she added. \"There's no information that says, Yes, if you build your home in a certain way, make it fire-hardened, invest in all the recommendations that the insurance companies are making, that they will actually agree to cover your property,\" she said. \"There are no guarantees. We don't know how to move forward.\"",

Gavin Newsom, Sunday\n\nWe say: Ha! Were that so, Newsom would hate himself most of all. In fact, he loves himself, despite (or maybe because of?) his false claims that people haven't fled California, his state has no crime problem and so on.\n\nHe even recently painted his childhood as financially troubled, though his dad was a successful, well-connected lawyer.\n\nIndeed, Newsom seems to see lying as a go-to-strategy -- at least, if you're Gavin Newsom.\n\n\"I'm also looking to be clear about the mandate that we won.\" -- Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, Tuesday\n\nWe say: Votes for Mamdani exceeded those against him by just 0.8%: With 93% of ballots counted, he had 1,036,051 votes (50.4%), versus 1,019,870 (49.6%) in total for Andrew Cuomo, Curtis Sliwa and other candidates.\n\nYet the AP (a supposedly impartial news outlet that takes fat donations from climate activists to fund \"reporting\" like this) now wants Americans to shrink their pets (or lose them completely).\n\nFirst they came for our gas stoves.

Are we next?\n\nWe say: Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani refuses to condemn the phrase \"globalize the intifadah,\" widely understood to mean \"attack Jews worldwide.\"\n\nHe opposes the existence of the world's only Jewish state, Israel, and falsely accused it of genocide.\n\nHe's blasted the state Assembly as a \"bastion of Zionist thought.\"\n\nAnd he's threatened to arrest Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for war crimes he hasn't committed but not to arrest leaders who actually have committed war crimes.",

        "description": "President Donald Trump makes an announcement from the Oval Office at the White House in Washington, D.C. on Nov. 6, 2025. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst\n\nPolitical scientists warn that Republicans' \"dummymandering\" strategy could backfire after Democratic landslide election results showed a different reality this week.\n\nGOP lawmakers have pointed to gerrymandering as a primary way to secure power. President Donald Trump pressured Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott to help him secure more GOP seats in the House, and Democrat California Gov. Gavin Newsom responded with Proposition 50 to redraw maps in the Golden State, according to MSNBC host Chris Hayes.\n\nThe initiative passed with an overwhelming majority on Tuesday night and helps California fight back against the maneuver to counter the additional five Republican seats with more California Democratic seats in the House.\n\nBut that upset the California GOP.\n\n\"California Republicans sued to stop the state from moving forward with redistricting and claimed the new map is unfair -- even as their party seeks to gerrymander other red states,\" Hayes reports.\n\nStill, Republicans want to implement the strategy.\n\n\"We are in a gerrymandering arms race, and there is no mystery as to why. After Tuesday's drubbing, House Speaker Mike Johnson made it clear that redistricting is how Republicans think they will win,\" he adds.\n\nBut the move might not be enough.\n\n\"If you are pulling supporters from a deep-red district to make another district red, you end up with two less-red districts. You also can't guarantee that your red voters from the last election will turn out for you again,\" Hayes reports.\n\n\"That means the Republicans' plan could backfire. If voters are angry enough at them, as they were on Tuesday, Republicans could lose both those 'red' districts. Political scientists even have a word for the phenomenon: 'dummymandering,'\" he explains.\n\nNewsom plans to oppose the Republican plan and made it known Tuesday night.\n\n\"We need the state of Virginia. We need the state of Maryland. We need our friends in New York and Illinois and Colorado. We need to see other states, the remarkable leaders that have been doing remarkable things, meet this moment head-on as well,\" Newsom said.",

        "title": "Chris Hayes: 'Dummymadering': How the GOP's redistricting push could backfire",
        "description": "On Tuesday, voters in California overwhelmingly approved a measure that allows the state's legislature to redraw its congressional districts, flipping up to five seats to Democrats in next year's midterm election.\n\nIt's known as Proposition 50 and was championed by Gov. Gavin Newsom as a response to the new Texas congressional maps that Republicans drew up at Donald Trump's request, which could take up to five seats away from Democrats in next year's midterms.\n\nOn Wednesday, California Republicans sued to stop the state from moving forward with redistricting and claimed the new map is unfair -- even as their party seeks to gerrymander other red states.\n\nIt appears Republicans are pretty much committed to picking their voters, rather than letting the voters pick them. This year, four Republican-controlled states have already redrawn their maps at Trump's request: Texas, Missouri, Ohio and North Carolina. The new maps would flip nine seats to Republicans -- at least in theory.\n\nBut nobody is talking about stopping there. Republicans in Indiana, Nebraska and Florida are all at least exploring redder congressional maps at Trump's behest. And several Democratic-controlled states are talking about responding in kind.\n\nWe are in a gerrymandering arms race, and there is no mystery as to why. After Tuesday's drubbing, House Speaker Mike Johnson made it clear that redistricting is how Republicans think they will win.\n\n\"I think the midterm is gonna be a great one for us,\" Johnson told reporters on Wednesday. \"We had a demographic shift in 2024. We have a very favorable election map on the Republican side, and it will be even more favorable once all the redistricting stuff has settled out.\"\n\nBut based on what we saw at the polls, I'm not so sure redistricting alone is going to be enough for Republicans. If you are pulling supporters from a deep-red district to make another district red, you end up with two less-red districts. You also can't guarantee that your red voters from the last election will turn out for you again.\n\nThat means the Republicans' plan could backfire. If voters are angry enough at them, as they were on Tuesday, Republicans could lose both those \"red\" districts. Political scientists even have a word for the phenomenon: \"dummymandering.\"\n\nDumb or not, this is how Republicans think they'll win. But as Newsom said on Tuesday, they will be opposed.\n\nThe California governor had a message for his fellow blue state governors: \"We need the state of Virginia. We need the state of Maryland. We need our friends in New York and Illinois and Colorado. We need to see other states, the remarkable leaders that have been doing remarkable things, meet this moment head-on as well.\"",

        "title": "Top five takeaways from Tuesday's elections",
        "description": "Democrats had a big night Tuesday. What did we learn from the voters?\n\nHistory repeats itself\n\nThe historical trend in New Jersey and Virginia is that the party opposite the incumbent president wins the gubernatorial race. With voters electing a Democrat for governor while Republican President Trump is in office, the trend continues.\n\nThat said, Republicans should not brush off the results as a routine trend. One, the margins of victory were larger than most expected them to be in the final results. Republican Glenn Youngkin won four years ago when Democrat Joseph R. Biden was president, but he polled just above 50%. Democrat Abigail Spanberger won with more than 57% of the vote. That helped other Democrats win close elections throughout the commonwealth.\n\nAlthough the party opposite the White House typically wins the gubernatorial races in Virginia and New Jersey, it can often serve as a bellwether for the midterm elections.\n\nVoters elected Republican Christine Todd Whitman as governor a year after Democrat Bill Clinton was elected president. The following year, a wave of Republicans retook the House and Senate as well as many other governorships across the country. The same thing happened the year after Republican Chris Christie was elected governor in New Jersey, when Barack Obama was in his first year as president.\n\nIt also goes the other way. In 2017, Democrat Phil Murphy was elected governor of New Jersey when Republican Donald Trump was president. During the 2018 Democratic wave, Republicans lost the House and many gubernatorial races. The same thing happened after Democrat Jon Corzine was elected governor in 2005 while Republican George W. Bush was president. Voters in swing states seem to want to counter what they perceive as overreach by either party.\n\nTDS is high in Democratic strongholds\n\nProposition 50 is the California ballot initiative that suspends the maps for congressional districts drawn by an independent commission and replaces them with a gerrymandered map adopted by the state Legislature, which Democrats control. It passed overwhelmingly Tuesday and will cost Republicans House seats from California.\n\nAn exit poll conducted by The Associated Press showed that roughly 7 in 10 voters in California said party control of Congress was \"very important\" to them. Those voters overwhelmingly supported Proposition 50. The exit poll also showed that approximately 80% of voters who supported the measure said it was necessary to counter changes made by Republicans in other states. Only 20% said it was the best way to draw maps.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom made his intentions clear before the vote when he said that if Democrats take the House majority in 2026, it will \"end Donald Trump's presidency as we know it.\" This is just the latest phase in Trump derangement syndrome.\n\nThis phenomenon was also a clear factor in Northern Virginia. The voters in the suburbs of Washington not only gave a clear victory to Ms. Spanberger but also helped elect a Democrat who said he fantasized about putting two bullets in the head of a Republican House speaker. Usually, that would be a disqualification for a candidate seeking to be the state's top prosecutor. Not in Northern Virginia. These people hate President Trump so much that they voted for Democrats across the board.\n\nHouse majority is in jeopardy\n\nMidterm elections are historically tough for the party of the incumbent president. That got much harder after Tuesday. New maps in California will likely cost the Republican Party several seats in the House. The massive blue wave in Virginia also will fuel the move to redraw boundaries there in a way that will make it very difficult for Republicans to hold on to several seats.\n\nPersonality matters\n\nZohran Mamdani is a charismatic candidate. His social media campaign was outstanding. He comes across as likable and was discussing issues that many voters care about.\n\nAfter the 2024 elections, I warned that many of the inroads made with younger voters were based on personality, not policy. Authenticity is a big deal, and they viewed Mr. Trump as genuine and Vice President Kamala Harris as a fraud. Mayor-elect Mamdani embraced his personality-driven brand of socialism, and younger voters liked it.\n\nThat said, New York City is a liberal place. Ms. Harris received two-thirds of the vote there last November. Overall, the rest of the mayoral vote was split between a Republican and a disgraced former governor who was running under a third-party banner. Conservatives need to recruit charismatic candidates.\n\nWages and prices are the big issues\n\nJames Carville famously said during the 1992 presidential campaign, \"It's the economy, stupid.\" He was right. Now it's all about higher wages and lower prices.\n\nTo avoid a blue wave next fall, Republicans must focus on wages and prices. People are genuinely concerned about these issues. They must see results as well as plans for the future. Thankfully, conservatives have answers. Let's get to work!",

        "title": "What Worked for Zohran Mamdani",
        "description": "The mayor-elect of New York City won without cynical AI tricks.\n\nThere are many fair questions following Zohran Mamdani's decisive victory. Will his campaign be a template for others? Will he be able or allowed to follow through on his campaign promises? Will the Democratic establishment accept that its future could look something like this proud 34-year-old democratic socialist? But there is at least one very clear takeaway, and it's best captured by one of the campaign's final videos.\n\nIt opens in the Bronx, five days after the 2024 election. Mamdani is holding a microphone in one hand and a handwritten sign in the other. It says Let's Talk Election. Most of the passersby don't bother to talk with him; the ones who do, at least the ones included in the video, speak about why they didn't vote (\"I lost faith\") or their decision to cast a ballot for Donald Trump. Mamdani listens with a furrowed brow.\n\nThen the video cuts to October 29, just last week, in the same neighborhood. Mamdani is now one of the most famous politicians in the country; people dap him up, shake his hand, roll down their car windows for him. It's a brilliant piece of campaign material: The story is simply that, by going out and talking to people -- by actually hearing them -- Mamdani built a movement from nothing. He's had numerous viral videos over the past year, many of which reached me even here in western Washington, far from his constituency.\n\nMamdani didn't win solely because he was good at using the internet or courting fandoms. But his campaign did offer something unique and effective: Mamdani positioned himself as an inversion of our current political dysfunction. In an era of American politics that's becoming more and more defined by trolling, shamelessness, and cheap propaganda, Mamdani proved himself to be the anti-slop candidate.\n\nToward the end of the race, the campaign of Mamdani's major opponent, former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, posted a racist AI-generated attack ad featuring \"criminals for Zohran Mamdani.\" In the ad, Mamdani runs through the streets and eats rice with his hands as a domestic abuser, a pimp, and a drug dealer offer their support for the politician. The campaign quickly deleted the ad off its X account after the backlash, though it wasn't the only AI content from Cuomo's people. Mamdani called out the ads -- not so much for their racism, but for their laziness. \"In a city of world-class artists and production crew hunting for the next gig, Andrew Cuomo made a TV ad the same way he wrote his housing policy: with AI,\" he posted, referencing reports from April that Cuomo's campaign had used ChatGPT to write his housing plan. (The campaign claimed that it used the chatbot for research purposes.)\n\nPoliticians, most notably President Donald Trump, have gravitated toward posting AI-generated imagery for four reasons: It is cheap, requires little effort, attracts attention, and is a useful tool for illustrating their (often fictional) political agendas. Cuomo tried to put imagery to the concerns that Mamdani's detractors had based, I suppose, on his race, ethnicity, and previous comments about decriminalizing certain activities (and prostitution in particular). It didn't work.\n\nContrast that with Mamdani's campaign ads, which were made for the internet but grounded in the physical space of New York City. In an interview with Defector, Andrew Epstein, the campaign's creative director, said that Mamdani's videos were about \"embedding Zohran in the kind of street-level life of New York City, putting him all over the city, interacting with people over the city in a million different contexts.\" The message of community appeared not only to resonate with younger voters who have felt estranged from politics and city life, but to draw them out and get them off their phones -- to rally, to canvass, and to vote.\n\nMany politicians now aim to attract attention by any means necessary. Trump's infamous AI-slop video of him in a fighter jet dumping feces on Americans protesting his administration is a great example. Mike Masnick of the Techdirt blog noted that these videos are \"not a policy response. Not an attempt at dialogue. Not even a coherent defense of whatever decisions prompted the protests. Just a middle finger, dressed up as content, optimized for maximum engagement from his base and maximum rage from everyone else.\" This type of trolling is a bedrock principle of MAGA politics.\n\nRead: Resistance is cringe -- but it's also effective\n\nBut it's not limited to Trump or even Republicans. Most Democratic lawmakers have come off as feckless or awkward when it comes to generating attention online -- they have what the writer Brian Beutler has dubbed a \"terminal insecurity\" that causes them to dodge, deflect, and pivot, rather than court controversy. In 2024, the Harris-Walz campaign seemed timid, participating in few press conferences and potentially adversarial interviews. In March, Walz told Politico, \"We shouldn't have been playing this thing so safe.\" California Governor Gavin Newsom has found success essentially by parroting Trump's social-media style and obnoxious tone back at the president on X. And although it's good for engagement and cathartic for Democrats who are tired of Trump, holding a mirror up to the president's boorishness feels mostly like empty engagement farming.\n\nMamdani's campaign offered something different. In January, it posted a video addressing \"Halalflation\" in which Mamdani talks with street vendors about New York's food-cart-permit problem. Mamdani gets the vendors to explain that, because of a backlog in the process, they are having to rent licenses for tens of thousands of dollars above the city-permit rate. Without the surcharge, halal-cart food would be cheaper. The message is clear: The city has a bureaucratic problem that's hurting vendors and consumers, and nobody in City Hall cares enough to fix it. On X, Mamdani's post of the video has more than 19 million views; on YouTube, it has just under 420,000.\n\nWhat works in New York may not work everywhere -- the issues and people aren't the same. But the point is that Mamdani acknowledged and spoke to the humanity of his prospective constituents, and did so with considerable discipline in staying on message. Throughout the campaign, when attacked, Mamdani seemed to respond by doubling down, not against his opponent but in solidarity with the people being attacked. At a moment when the Democratic establishment was publicly questioning how vocal it ought to be about trans rights, Mamdani's campaign let it be known that he wasn't wavering: He released a video of him speaking about Sylvia Rivera, a trans activist who died in 2002. Not long after Cuomo laughed on a radio show after its host suggested that Mamdani, a Muslim, might cheer the 9/11 attacks if they happened today, Mamdani's campaign posted a video for Arabic-speaking voters in which Mamdani speaks the language fluently. Mamdani said in his victory speech Tuesday night: \"I refuse to apologize for any of this.\"\n\nTrump's America is an endless series of battles in which rampant bigotry, vicious attacks, lies, and propaganda from the right square off against a Democratic apparatus that still doesn't quite know how to handle an assault on democracy and once-agreed-upon norms. Institutional politicians have largely reacted with fear and insecurity, creating a leadership vacuum that has led to a sense that politics is a practice that gives a natural advantage to the most shameless actors. This has left some with the feeling that the cheapest, most craven campaign strategies end up being the most successful. In meaningful ways, Mamdani's campaign was a case study to prove whether a more optimistic and human approach could work in our political moment. He proved that it can.",

        "title": "A Prison Hospice Program in California Offers Care to Dying Inmates",
        "description": "Mario Koran, who has written for The Times about serving time in jail, spoke with more than a dozen current and formerly incarcerated people to understand their experiences with death behind bars.\n\nGerrard Hite is circling the path that winds around the garden, pointing out the plants he has nurtured under a merciless California sun. He knows the name of each one in this 4,000-square-foot garden, their history, even their names in Latin. He moves casually but with purpose, pausing to gently scoop up a branch of a Mexican sage bush.\n\nThis one, he explains, is special: It attracts the hummingbird, the symbol for hospice and the reason he and others who tend to the dying wear pins of them on their shirts.\n\nMr. Hite is incarcerated at California Medical Facility in Vacaville, Calif., a medium-security penitentiary within the state's sprawling prison system. Most of the 2,144 men who live here require specialized medical care. Some are dying in the facility's hospice unit. Others, like Mr. Hite, have volunteered to look after their peers in their final days. For them, the unit, and the garden in particular, offers something rare in prison: a sense of purpose and connection.\n\n\"When you get outside these walls, when you're released, you breathe fresh air, freedom air, which is different than the air in here,\" said Mr. Hite, who has been locked up for 48 years. \"But in the garden, you get a little piece of that free air.\"\n\nThe hospice unit at California Medical Facility was built in 1993 in response to the AIDS crisis and demands for more humane care. It was the nation's first licensed hospice program in a prison. It has since become a model for others around the country.\n\nIn addition to a clinical staff, the 17-bed unit employs social workers, psychologists and a chaplain. Some inmates, referred to as pastoral care workers, are trained to provide end-of-life care, helping to bathe patients, clean wounds, change dressings, handle oxygen tanks and assist in whatever other duties nurses request.\n\nBut they also provide companionship, the kind that a family member might: doing puzzles, writing letters and simply spending time with them. Despite their training, pastoral care workers make only about 24 cents an hour -- nearly 75 percent less than the wage for men who sweep the floors of the prison. (Those workers make $1 an hour.) But more than one pastoral care worker said their duties on the unit were more important than making money.\n\n\"If they didn't pay me anything at all, I would still do this,\" said Jerry Judson, who has worked on the unit for the past six years and is the lead technician, responsible for ordering and organizing supplies. \"This work has helped bring me back to humanity.\"\n\nUntil 2018, the unit's garden was little more than a slab of concrete topped by a corrugated roof and ringed by a chain-link fence -- a patio that looked out onto a courtyard of hardpan dirt.\n\nIt has since become the unit's centerpiece: A place where staffing meetings happen, where families reunite for the first time in decades, where men are wheeled out in their hospital beds for one last look at the world.\n\nDr. Joseph Bick, the prisons's former chief medical executive and the driving force behind the garden, said that in a place surrounded by death, he wanted to create something restorative, not just for the dying, but also for the volunteers and staff members devoted to their care.\n\nWhat the garden eventually became started with a question to residents: What did they miss? Feedback poured in. They wanted to hear running water and some sort of motion -- inspiration for the trickling fountain and the swinging bench where pastoral care workers rock idly in the shade.\n\nThey wanted something else, too: to remember what it was like to touch grass, something some inmates hadn't done for decades. One day, Dr. Bick recalls, he was planting a tree when he saw a hospice patient approach the garden in his walker. He was near the end. He flipped off his sandals, raised his hands to the sky and gave praise for the simple act of being able to stand in grass.\n\nA Crisis Decades in the Making\n\nJust as the general population in the United States is aging, so too is the population of people who are in prison -- only faster. In 1991, incarcerated people over 50 years old made up just 3 percent of the U.S. prison population, according to a 2025 report by the University of Texas at Austin and the American Civil Liberties Union. Researchers predict that by 2030, that number could reach as much as 30 percent. This is, in part, a result of policy choices: Sentencing practices from the tough-on-crime era of the '80s and '90s have kept people in prison longer.\n\nAt the same time, a growing body of research suggests that prison conditions accelerate the body's aging process, reducing life expectancy by two years for every year behind bars. And with states already spending two to five times as much on incarcerated individuals older than 50 compared to other age groups, a rapidly graying population will further strain the prison system's ability to care for those in their custody.\n\nOne way to address this is compassionate release, which allows people to be released early if they meet certain criteria, such as age or terminal illness. But the process and criteria vary widely by state, and logistical barriers are often so high that people can't get through them, said Dr. Michele DiTomas, medical director of the hospice unit at California Medical Facility.\n\nDr. DiTomas, known around the unit as a tenacious advocate for compassionate release, recalled how, not so long ago, the approval process was convoluted and often took longer than a person had left to live.\n\n\"There's so many places where that system historically fell apart,\" said Dr. DiTomas, who helped create a statewide tracking system so that family members can check the status of compassionate release applications and see where they are stalled.\n\nBut a series of policy changes over the last decade has helped streamline the process. Dr. DiTomas said that California now approves about 100 people a year for compassionate release, up from around 10.\n\nThere are, of course, those opposed to compassionate release who believe that incarcerated people should serve their full sentences, whether or not they are dying. Dr. DiTomas acknowledged this. But she also noted that not all victims favor extreme or harsh sentences. \"Victims aren't a monolith of what they want, and many victims don't want to see that person's family suffer as well,\" she said.\n\nThe Ministry of Presence\n\nWhile the data is murky, it's estimated that less than 5 percent of all state and federal prisons in the United States offer hospice programs. Most people who die in prison stand a good chance of dying alone -- a fate described by current and former inmates as worse than death itself.\n\n\"You're away from everything that's meaningful to you and feel isolated, anonymous, invisible,\" said Fernando Murillo, who spent 24 years in California prisons, including six as a pastoral care worker at California Medical Facility. Today he works as a program manager for the Humane Prison Hospice Project, an organization that uses a curriculum influenced by the one at California Medical Facility to train palliative care workers at other prisons.\n\nAt California Medical Facility, as a patient nears what doctors expect to be the last 48 to 72 hours of his life, a pastoral care worker is assigned to sit vigil so no one dies alone. At a staff meeting in July, Rev. Keith Knauf, a chaplain at the prison and one of the longest-tenured employees on the unit, shared an update on two patients, both of whom had woken up bewildered and frightened, calling out for help. In each case, they were soothed when they saw a pastoral care worker by their side, and fell back asleep.\n\nRev. Knauf said that when it comes time to sit vigil, it isn't about what a person says or does to comfort those who are dying. It's about simply being with them. On the unit they call it the ministry of presence.\n\nTo Allan Krenitsky, a pastoral care worker, accompanying patients during their final moments is one of life's great honors -- one he wasn't always prepared to appreciate. He was just 23 years old in 1988 when he shot and killed a man in his Los Angeles home. Mr. Krenitsky was convicted of murder and sentenced to life without parole.\n\nHe didn't expect to last long in prison. He had been diagnosed with hepatitis C and H.I.V. -- essentially a death sentence in the late '80s. He recalled in gritty detail the segregated unit where he and others with the virus were confined and how they were ostracized. But he also remembered how they cared for their cellmates, changing their diapers or helping them bathe.\n\n\"That left an impression on me,\" he said. \"We understood that one day the people around you would take care of you just like you're taking care of people now.\"\n\nUltimately, Mr. Krenitsky grew up in prison. Medications improved. He started reading and went to college. He married a woman who had been a pen pal and started a family from behind bars. But he still knew deep down that he would one day die in prison.\n\nAnd then, this year, came the unthinkable: A call from Gov. Gavin Newsom telling Mr. Krenitsky his sentence had been commuted and he would go in front of the parole board. His hearing is scheduled for this month.\n\nIf he's released, Mr. Krenitsky won't come out unscathed. He wears a black patch where he lost an eye to infection. But with his easy way and lilting southern drawl, he has become a trusted leader on the unit and proved talented at engaging patients' memories and comforting them as they approach their last breath. For him, it's atonement.\n\n\"It haunts me, but I can never take that back,\" he said of the killing. \"But I can try to be a decent person for the rest of my life.\"\n\nOne day this summer, as the late morning sun poured down on the scorched grass on the hills that seem to stand sentry over the prison, the garden was abuzz with activity. Employees wrapped up a staff meeting and collected their things. Pastoral workers swayed on the swinging bench. Mr. Judson, the lead technician, sat by a man who had been wheeled out in a hospital bed, holding his hand.\n\nMr. Hite, the head gardener, held a fistful of weeds. He takes pride in knowing that the hours he puts into the garden are in service of others, particularly the patients.\n\n\"I think people can see life and death in the plants,\" he said. \"It's solace to their souls to be able to see and be part of that.\"",

        "title": "More than 500,000 Californians demand voting overhaul, back 'straightforward' ID law",
        "description": "FIRST ON FOX: More than 500,000 California voters have signed a petition to amend the state's constitution to enforce voter ID laws for all elections, leaders of a coalition called Californians for Voter ID told Fox News Digital.\n\n\"We had a dog that voted in the last couple elections in Costa Mesa,\" Republican California state Sen. Tony Strickland told Fox News Digital in a Wednesday phone interview of California's persistent voter integrity concerns. \"We don't clean up our voter rolls. There are so many times where people move, college kids go out of state, or people move and they don't clean up the voter rolls. And we mail out to everybody, and so you have a lot of live ballots with ballot harvesting.\"\n\n\"Our initiative will now clean up the voter rolls throughout the state,\" he added.\n\nStrickland, who represents a district that includes portions of Orange and Los Angeles counties along the Southern California coast, is helping lead the charge to collect more than one million petition signatures from California voters in order to force the issue on the ballot for the 2026 election. The signature collection kicked off Oct. 1, meaning the group collected support from more than half-a-million voters in a one-month span.\n\nCALIFORNIA REPUBLICANS LAUNCH VOTER ID BALLOT PUSH, NEED 875K SIGNATURES BY DEADLINE\n\nThe Californians for Voter ID initiative specifically would amend California's constitution and require voters to present government-issued IDs before casting a ballot in all future elections in the state.\n\nCalifornia voters would be required to present a government-issued ID before voting in-person, or provide the last four-digits of a government ID if voting by mail. Election officials, under the initiative, would be required to verify a voter's citizenship to ensure only legal residents register to vote or receive ballots.\n\nDemocrats historically have opposed voter ID laws over claims it disenfranchises minority voters, while conservatives argue it will ensure only legal residents are able to cast ballots and further bolster voter integrity. Thirty-six states have voter ID laws already on the books, though such laws vary and have some exceptions.\n\nCalifornians for Voter ID leaders, however, say the issue is not a partisan one, but an effort to protect democracy for all Americans.\n\nThe lead strategist for the effort, Ryan Erwin, told Fox News Digital that recent polling shows 70% of Californians across the political spectrum support elections requiring IDs to vote, while underscoring the outpouring of support that has led to more than 500,000 signatures already secured.\n\n\"We are on pace to qualify for the ballot faster than any measure in the history of California,\" Erwin said. \"Voter ID is a commonsense way to build trust in the election process by requiring election officials to use government data to verify citizenship and voter eligibility, while also requiring identification for every vote counted.\"\n\nOBAMA ENDORSES NEWSOM CALIFORNIA REDISTRICTING PROP 50\n\n\"Californians of all political stripes are eager to improve trust in the system by eliminating abuse and errors while protecting every eligible vote,\" he continued. \"The volunteer effort is over-performing, we have signatures from all 58 counties, and are on pace to qualify well ahead of our goal.\"\n\nThe group needs a total of 874,641 in order to land the initiative on the 2026 ballot in the Golden State, but is aiming to secure 1.2 million signatures to ensure the support is certified by county officials who will go through the data before it is permitted to land on the ballot. Organizers have until March to secure the needed signatures before potentially getting on the ballot -- with Strickland reporting he's confident they will get the needed support.\n\n\"You have to be a citizen in order to register to vote,\" Strickland said of the nuts and bolts of the amendment itself, calling it \"very straightforward.\"\n\n\"You have seven forms of documentation, you get to choose what form of documentation that you use in terms of the last four digits of whatever the documentation is,\" he said. \"When you go to the polls, you show your ID, and if you mail in your ballot, you show that proof of the documentation of the last four digits that you choose.\"\n\n\"The other part of this initiative is we have a mandatory audit (to) all 58 counties of their election rules after every election,\" he added.\n\nStrickland is no stranger to voter ID efforts in the deep blue state, including championing a voter ID ballot initiative in Huntington Beach, California, in 2024, when he served on the city council. Voters approved the amendment forcing voters to show their ID when casting ballots in local elections, but the California Court of Appeals struck down the law in November.\n\nIf the statewide voter ID effort is approved by voters on the ballot in 2026, local lawmakers will be compelled to comply with voter ID laws set forth in the initiative.\n\nTRUMP SAYS HE WILL REQUIRE VOTER ID WITH EXECUTIVE ORDER\n\nStrickland said the massive amount of support the initiative already has received is on par with a 1978 initiative, Proposition 13, \"when the legislature was out of touch with the people, the people rose up\" and passed the ballot measure that fundamentally changed how property taxes were assessed and limited in California.\n\nStrickland also compared it to the successful recall of former Democratic Gov. Gray Davis in 2003 -- California's first and only successful recall of a governor. Strickland was the first legislator to endorse Davis' recall as energy and economic woes rocked the state.\n\n\"Speaking around the state of California, I would equate what's going on today with voter ID and voter integrity to those two movements in California,\" he said.\n\nThe California state senator also praised California Republican Assemblyman Carl DeMaio and his group, Reform California, for their ongoing efforts championing voter ID laws in the state, describing DeMaio's work as \"relentless.\" Strickland and DeMaio are joint authors of the voter ID push and have teamed up to meet with voters at various events to rally support, including a recent event in Santa Barbara where the people couldn't get through the door because it was so packed, he said.\n\nVOTER ID LAW IN TEXAS WINS AT APPEALS COURT AFTER BIDEN ADMIN LAWSUIT\n\nCalifornia's voting laws have fallen under the Trump administration's critical eye just this week, with White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt posting to X Tuesday that the Golden State has the \"WORST laws for securing elections in the entire nation.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump said Tuesday that California is facing a \"very serious legal and criminal review\" over claims the state's special election to redraw congressional district lines was mired in corruption. Voters passed the measure to redistrict on Tuesday, with Gov. Gavin Newsom celebrating\n\n\"California doesn't require voters to show photo ID before casting a ballot - despite nearly 90% of Americans supporting photo ID laws,\" Leavitt posted in a lengthy message detailing issues she sees with the state's election process. \"California uses universal mail-in-balloting, which we know is extremely vulnerable to fraud and abuse. In the 2024 election alone, California mailed nearly 10 million mail-in ballots that were never returned.\"\n\nThe Heritage Foundation keeps a database compiling cases of known voter fraud -- namely cases that have led to criminal convictions -- and found California has at least 68 cases of voter fraud since 2001. The examples include individuals who fraudulently used absentee ballots for duplicate votes, non-resident voting, and fraudulent voter registration.\n\nThe database shows other states, such as Illinois and Texas, have more instances of confirmed voting fraud, at more than 100 cases each, while other states such as Nebraska have seen at least three instances of confirmed voter fraud in recent years.\n\nNewsom has countered the claims, arguing California's elections are fair and secure while slamming Trump over his remarks.\n\n\"He also announced today, right when polls were opening, that this election was rigged. Of course, those are familiar words. It's exactly what Donald Trump said after January 6th, that day of love, where he tried to light democracy on fire, he tried to wreck this country,\" Newsom said Tuesday after polling showed the state passed Proposition 50 to redistrict.\n\n\"I hope it's dawning on people the sobriety of this moment,\" Newsom continued. \"What's at stake. Tonight, as I said, is an extraordinary moment for our party, but again, it's an extraordinary moment affirming those principles. Our founding fathers did not live and die to see the kind of vandalism to this republic and our democracy that Donald Trump is trying to perpetuate.\"\n\nFor Strickland, he championed that the voter ID initiative will move ahead with the help of grassroots efforts and a little \"homework.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"I'm going to speak to two groups today, and I give them homework assignments, just saying, 'Please take those packets. We're planning to go get 50 signatures, go get 100.' And I use a sports analogy. I say, in baseball, if you hit two times out of every 10, you're barely making the major leagues. You're probably going down the minor leagues. But if you get three hits every 10, you're an all-star. And I'm asking everybody to get that extra hit in life,\" Strickland said.",

        "title": "Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi Will Retire From Congress",
        "description": "Representative Nancy Pelosi, the only female House speaker, said she will not run for re-election. She wielded immense power and became a Democratic icon, while she was demonized by conservatives.\n\nRepresentative Nancy Pelosi announced on Thursday that she will retire when her term concludes in early 2027, ending a remarkable career in which she rose to become one of the most powerful women in American history.\n\nMs. Pelosi, 85, was the nation's first and only female House speaker, and she will have represented San Francisco in Congress for 39 years when she leaves office. She has served during an era of seismic change for American society and her own city, from the throes of the AIDS crisis to the legalization of gay marriage, and through the meteoric rise of the tech sector and the nation's extreme polarization.\n\nShe entered political office later in life and became a hero to Democrats for the way she wielded immense power to push Obamacare, climate change legislation and infrastructure programs through Congress.\n\nMs. Pelosi, who likes to use the phrase \"resting is rusting,\" led the House Democrats for 20 years, eight of which she spent as speaker. She has also been a prodigious fund-raiser and raised more than $1.3 billion for Democratic campaigns, according to her aides.\n\nBut she was reviled by conservatives, who painted her as the scary embodiment of liberal San Francisco values and blamed her for what they considered the nation's decline.\n\nShe has been a chief irritant to President Trump, even to this day, calling him \"a vile creature\" in a CNN interview that aired this week. She presided over two of his impeachment trials. And he has called her \"Crazy Nancy,\" with no sense of fondness for his foe.\n\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment on her impending retirement. Neither did several Republicans with whom Ms. Pelosi has clashed over the years.\n\nHer Democratic colleagues said she was unlike any other politician with whom they had worked. Jackie Speier, a Bay Area Democrat who served in the House for 15 years, said that Ms. Pelosi would go down in history \"as the most consequential speaker ever.\"\n\n\"She has a command, a presence. All eyes turn to her,\" Ms. Speier said.\n\nHer retirement had been grist for the local and national political rumor mill for several years, and younger Democrats grew increasingly eager to run for her seat. They feared, however, that it would be folly to challenge one of the most powerful politicians in modern history.\n\nMs. Pelosi, for her part, told CNN days ago that she had no doubt she would win re-election if she were to run for another term.\n\nStill, the overwhelming defeat Democrats suffered last year in the congressional and presidential races has prompted soul-searching within the party -- and louder calls for older Democrats to step down and make way for new politicians with fresh ideas.\n\nThe race to succeed Ms. Pelosi was already shaping up to be a fierce one before she announced her retirement. Scott Wiener, a Democratic state senator from San Francisco who is a champion of housing construction, and Saikat Chakrabarti, who worked as Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's chief of staff, have already announced they were running for the seat -- with or without Ms. Pelosi on the ballot.\n\nIn recent months, Ms. Pelosi has refused to discuss her career plans, insisting she was focused solely on the passage of California's Proposition 50, a ballot measure to approve newly drawn House districts. She worked behind the scenes to help Gov. Gavin Newsom craft the measure, which passed on Tuesday, and to raise money for the effort.\n\nIt was considered one of her final achievements, both a blow to Mr. Trump, who had sought more Republican seats in the House by gerrymandering in conservative states, and a parting gift to the next generation of California Democrats who could benefit from as many as five additional seats in the state.\n\nAt a packed union hall in San Francisco on Monday morning, Ms. Pelosi emceed a Proposition 50 rally that included Mr. Newsom and labor leader Dolores Huerta.\n\n\"This is a moment of truth for America,\" Ms. Pelosi told the crowd. \"It's self-defense for our democracy.\"\n\nIn the audience, union workers wore T-shirts that Ms. Pelosi had autographed for them and pins with drawings of six tiny Nancy Pelosis standing side by side, each wearing a suit in a different color of the rainbow.\n\nAt the rally, the ever-stylish Ms. Pelosi was sporting a green corduroy suit and green stilettos, never mind the fall she took in December on a marble staircase in Luxembourg that forced her to get a hip replacement and remain stuck for several months in dreaded flats.\n\nMs. Pelosi's career in elected office has been a long one, but it did not span even half her life. Born into a politically powerful family of Democrats in Baltimore -- her father and brother each served as the city's mayor -- Ms. Pelosi went the more traditional route for women of her age.\n\nAt first, anyway.\n\nShe met her husband, Paul Pelosi, at Georgetown University, and the couple moved to his hometown, San Francisco, where she stayed home to raise their five children. During that time, Mr. Pelosi grew his career as a venture capitalist.\n\nAs a young mother, Ms. Pelosi found a way to support the Democratic Party by opening up the family's large home for fund-raisers. That led to friendships with a host of prominent San Francisco Democrats in the 1970s and 1980s, including Willie Brown, Jerry Brown and Phil and John Burton, brothers who served in Congress.\n\nHer connections and fund-raising prowess helped her get elected as the first woman to chair the California Democratic Party.\n\nWhen Representative Phil Burton died in office, his wife, Sala Burton, replaced him. Sala Burton was soon after diagnosed with cancer and told Ms. Pelosi she wanted her to run for the seat. Ms. Pelosi, who had shrugged off other suggestions to run for elected office, finally agreed.\n\nA special election was held in June 1987, and Ms. Pelosi, then 47, edged out Harry Britt, a gay socialist who had worked as an aide to Harvey Milk, the San Francisco supervisor who was assassinated at City Hall in 1978.\n\nCleve Jones, who also worked for Mr. Milk and who created the AIDS Memorial Quilt, had backed Mr. Britt. Mr. Jones recalled in an interview that he initially had dismissed Ms. Pelosi as \"a society lady.\"\n\n\"I had the most wrong first impression of Nancy Pelosi,\" he said. \"I just didn't take her very seriously.\"\n\nBut he said his view changed when Ms. Pelosi used her first floor speech in the House to talk about the AIDS crisis as the Reagan administration largely ignored it. That same year, she helped Mr. Jones get his quilt installed on the National Mall in Washington.\n\nIn 1990, she fought for the passage of an act named after Ryan White, a teenager who contracted H.I.V. from a blood transfusion and was banned from his school after his diagnosis. The program paid for health care for H.I.V./AIDS patients who lacked medical coverage.\n\n\"She's just always been there,\" Mr. Jones said. \"She's more than an ally. She's family.\"\n\nBarbara Boxer, who represented a different part of San Francisco in the House and later became a U.S. senator, said in an interview that she and Ms. Pelosi were constantly confused for each other and lumped together as \"the two women from San Francisco.\"\n\nThey bonded by sitting next to each other during countless flights home. Ms. Boxer praised her friend's unique combination of her social justice values, driven by her Catholic faith, and her tactical ability to know every facet of every bill and exactly where each member stood on it.\n\nTogether, they convinced the federal government to dump a plan to turn San Francisco's military base, the Presidio, into condominiums. Instead, the government preserved it as a national park.\n\nKaren Bass, the mayor of Los Angeles who served in Congress alongside Ms. Pelosi, said her colleague was a \"masterful leader\" who listened to widespread dissent in her caucus, but used her smarts and persuasion to repeatedly corral them and win key votes.\n\n\"I was in awe watching her,\" she said.\n\nMs. Pelosi's rise -- and her wins on Capitol Hill -- made her a regular target for conservatives. During the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, some rioters made a beeline for her office, tore down her wooden nameplate and broke into her chambers. One man, who was later prosecuted, was seen sitting in her chair with his feet propped up on her desk in a display of defiance.\n\nThe next year, in October 2022, her husband was brutally attacked in the Pelosi home by a man living in the Bay Area who seemed obsessed with right-wing conspiracy theories.\n\nOn Monday, however, Mr. Pelosi was at the union hall with his wife, appearing healthy.\n\nAt the Proposition 50 rally, Mr. Newsom thanked Ms. Pelosi for her work on the ballot measure.\n\n\"Some people go off and they talk about the way the world should be, but they don't do anything to damn manifest it,\" he said. \"Nancy Pelosi doesn't go out to try to make points. She makes a difference.\"\n\nMs. Pelosi stood behind him, beaming. Then, she exited the stage.",

        "title": "Will 2026 Be a Fair Fight?",
        "description": "Go ahead, Democrats. Congratulate yourselves on your multiple victories in this week's elections. Enjoy your parties. Indulge in fantasies about how big your tent can be, how many new presidential prospects now seem possible. But after that, brace yourselves, because Republicans may not be playing by the same rules a year from now.\n\nSince President Donald Trump took office for his second term -- indeed, since his loss in 2020 -- he has shown his willingness to subvert the rules of free and fair elections. In various ways, he's used his power to intimidate potential opponents, Democratic donors, and even voters who might oppose him. His administration appointed the election denier Heather Honey to the newly created role of deputy assistant secretary for election integrity. This week's decisive Democratic victories mean that Trump and his allies have no reason to stray from that path as the 2026 midterms approach. As Trump posted on Truth Social just after the Democratic victories were announced this week: \"...AND SO IT BEGINS!\"\n\nDemocrats have started working the refs in response. On the ballot in California this week was Proposition 50, a new initiative to gerrymander the state's congressional districts in Democrats' favor. Governor Gavin Newsom did not advocate Proposition 50 as a way to better reflect the state's changing population or to promote racial equity. Instead the measure was written explicitly as payback. \"The people of California, not politicians, should have the power to approve temporary congressional district maps in response to President Trump's election-rigging scheme,\" it reads. The measure, called the Election Rigging Response Act, passed by an enormous margin. Perhaps it is the temporary emergency measure Newsom billed it as. But once the gerrymandering arms race gets going, it might be hard to stop its momentum.\n\nIn this episode of Radio Atlantic, we talk to our staff writer David A. Graham about the vote this year and next. His December cover story warns that Trump is already laying the groundwork to subvert the next vote. We talk about this week's election as a test run for 2026, gerrymandering, and future possible scenarios of election meddling.\n\nHanna Rosin: Democrats won big. That's the main takeaway from this week's elections.\n\nIt's the first time that voters across the country got to voice their opinion since Donald Trump was reelected -- and their answer, in this admittedly limited test run, was: \"No, thank you.\" It was blue, blue, blue everywhere.\n\nRosin: And it was true in local races all around the country, like, most notably, New York City, where Zohran Mamdani made history as a young Muslim progressive now elected mayor.\n\nRosin: Democrats are, of course, enjoying their victory parties, measuring how big their tent could get, daring to dream of retaking the House in 2026 to be some sort of check on Trump.\n\nBut that is still a ways away. And in the meantime, there's another important election story brewing, which is that the president does not wanna play by the normal rules.\n\nRosin: I'm Hanna Rosin. This is Radio Atlantic. That was staff writer David Graham. For the latest cover story of the magazine, he examined how Trump and his allies could dispute and disrupt the election process.\n\nWith this week's voting behind us, we're gonna talk about the big one, the one all election watchers are watching, 2026 -- and just how wild the attacks on the voting system might get.\n\nGraham: I think it's not the results, but the size of them. You look at New Jersey, where Democrats seemed really nervous going in, and there were some polls that showed Mikie Sherrill just a few points up, and she won by nearly as much as Abigail Spanberger did. So it really does look like a Democratic romp.\n\nRosin: After the election, Trump made this cryptic post: \"...AND SO IT BEGINS!\" Obviously, we don't know what he was referring to, but what do you think he was referring to?\n\nGraham: (Laughs.) Great question, as always with him. I was just, before we got on here, watching a clip of him saying, you know, If Democrats take power, they're gonna make D.C. a state; they're gonna make Puerto Rico a state. They're gonna do all these horrible things.\n\nGraham: It sounds, certainly, very threatening. And I think you can connect that to the sorts of seizures of power and attempts to intimidate and sideline Democrats and political opponents that he's been doing all along. So if it hasn't already begun, I'm curious what it might look like now that \"it begins.\"\n\nRosin: So then is there a chance that the Democratic victory, the decisiveness of it, will kick something up in Trump world, will cause them to view the 2026 election with some new urgency?\n\nGraham: I think that they already view it with a lot of urgency, and I think this is going to make them more worried about it.\n\nAnd I don't think what they're going to do is moderate their policies. I think what they're gonna do is go even harder on the things that they've been doing -- charging Democrats, pressuring the media, pressuring local election authorities, pushing for gerrymanders in Republican-led states -- doing anything they can to make the election closer without having to actually change the policies that they wanna pursue.\n\nRosin: And does this broad category that you're describing -- intimidating opponents, intimidating the press -- do we call this, what, election disruption? How do you categorize this?\n\nGraham: I think it's hard to describe because it's kind of on a spectrum with typical politicking. Everybody tries to work the refs. And I found it really helpful to think about it as what political scientists call competitive authoritarianism, where you try to tilt the playing field well ahead of the election and just sort of set society in a way that makes it very hard for the opposition to ever win.\u200a Opposition candidates are allowed, but they might be investigated or intimidated or arrested for offenses that don't have to deal with elections. So you do all these things simply to make it really hard for them to really compete, even though they're allowed to exist, and you have this kind of impression of democracy going on.\n\nAnd so if you look at all the things he's doing together, I think -- and using government power to do those things -- I think they fit under that rubric.\n\nRosin: David, the president has repeatedly threatened to pull federal funding from New York City. Republican members of Congress have proposed deporting Mamdani, who was born in Uganda. Are these threats a kind of election interference? Is this the kind of thing that you mean?\n\nGraham: I think the threat to take funding away from New York very much is. It's telling voters, If you vote for this candidate, we will make you suffer for it.\n\nRosin: So we have no indication that Trump is gonna, say, cancel the midterm elections. So in general, when you talk to election experts, what form of election interference were they worried about?\n\nGraham: They were worried about every kind. The thing that jumped out to me was their concern about the involvement of the military -- which is the sort of thing that I thought was maybe just paranoia, but these are people who I don't think are prone to paranoia, and they were very concerned about that.\n\nBut they're also concerned about everything else. They're worried about having a media that is cowed. They're worrying about whether the media will refuse to take ads from Democrats because they're afraid of retaliation from the FCC, for example. They're worried about seizure of voting rolls. They're worried about the federal government pressing local officials to do things that are against the law. They're worried about withdrawal of funds for cybersecurity and physical security. They're worried about sowing doubt.\n\nIt's this whole smorgasbord of ways that Trump can undermine the integrity of the elections.\n\nRosin: Mm-hmm. And what were you watching in this election? 'Cause this election is a prelude to 2026, which is where it's really heated up and intense. Did you see anything in this election that indicated some of these shenanigans?\n\nGraham: The thing that I thought stuck out most was the Justice Department announcing that it was sending monitors to New Jersey and to California to take a look at elections. And this is the kind of thing -- on the one hand, DOJ monitors elections; it's something they do. But it's really conspicuous in both a race that affects the balance of power in the house in California and in what was considered to be a close race for governor in New Jersey. It looks like pressure on election officials and pressure on voters, and more than that, it seems like a way of sort of testing methods ahead of the midterms.\n\nSo first, you send out people to these kinds of things, and then maybe you do more of that in the midterms, and you start using the DOJ as a way to suppress votes or to mess with local officials.\n\nThe election officials who I've talked to were less concerned about what would happen in this election than how it's kind of a dry run for a bigger effort in a year.\n\nRosin: Let's talk about one of the big things that happened, which is the redistricting ballot in California. What do you think [California Governor] Gavin Newsom was trying to accomplish?\n\nGraham: I think two things. One of them was getting attention for Gavin Newsom, which is always a top priority for him. (Laughs.)\n\nBut the other one was trying to even the score on this gerrymandering. We've seen Texas, Missouri, North Carolina all redistrict in order to add, basically, safe Republican seats to the house in what we expect will be a close midterm election. And so I think this is Democrats trying to find ways to strike back on that.\n\nAnd we see Maryland doing the same thing, potentially. We see other states talking about it. But California has the most room to squeeze Republicans and had to do it by a vote of the people because there is a law that sets up independent redistricting already in place.\n\nRosin: One thing that surprised me about the California ballot was how explicitly it referred to Texas. It talked about attacks by the Trump administration and his MAGA Republicans and a Republican power grab orchestrated by President Trump. This struck me as unusual to include in a state proposition.\n\nGraham: I think that's right. It's really weird. I think it's a sign of how nationalized these elections are that California voters are concerned more about the balance of power in Washington than they are about the specifics of their state. And I think it's particularly glaring in California, where voters passed a law insisting on independent redistricting to avoid this kind of gerrymandering and then, by a wide margin in these elections, basically temporarily reversed themselves.\n\nAnd this seems like backsliding on a lot of fairness reforms we've seen. And it seems a way in which Trump forces his opponents to become more like him in order to compete, and I think that's a kind of race to the bottom.\n\nRosin: Right, right. So it's not necessarily healthy for a democracy for redistricting to become this kind of national showdown?\n\nGraham: Right. I think it's really bad for democracy -- and it's bad for voters. There are lots of Democrats in Texas and lots of Republicans in California who are going to be less fairly represented because of these changes.\n\n[Music]\n\nRosin: After the break: If the president is test-running ways to disrupt an election, what would that actually look like in 2026?\n\n[Break]\n\nRosin: Okay, David, let's get specific. Play out a scenario for me in 2026 that's reasonably plausible.\n\n[Music]\n\nGraham: So let's imagine that it's election night. The ballots are being counted. And as the night closes, Republicans are up in a couple of these races, but we still have a lot of ballots left to count, as we saw in 2020.\n\nSo Trump declares victory. He has a White House address. He says the GOP's held the House, but warns the Democrats are gonna try to steal that. He immediately starts concentrating all of the firepower he can on making sure that voting stops and that the elections are called that way. So maybe he has the Justice Department sending letters to Arizona's government, where there are really close races, let's say. He sends the FBI there. He has Republican lawyers filing lawsuits. Even as this happens, ballots are still being counted; Democrats start to pull ahead.\n\nAt this point, amid extensive claims of fraud, Trump sends in Marines from a base in Yuma on the basis that there's a national emergency going on in Phoenix. They go in, and they seize the voting machines, so we have already broken the chain of custody on these machines. The FBI arrives. They say that votes have been tampered with, insist that Republicans have won.\n\nSo now you have Marines on the street. You have protests going on. Trump is saying that he needs to use the Insurrection Act, that he's gonna send the military out to Democrat-run cities around the country. And it's unclear who has really won.\n\nAnd I can imagine this going further. Democrats, maybe, are eventually certified as the winners of these races, but a slim House majority of Republicans reject that, they seat Republican candidates, and that helps Republicans hold the House, and the election is rejected by a lot of Americans as being obviously unfair.\n\nRosin: So this is where you have a gray situation, a lot of thinking and infrastructure in place, and it's ambiguous enough that Republicans could claim they won.\n\nGraham: Right. I think the ambiguity is really important, and that's one reason why you see Trump and people around him talking about, quote, unquote, \"election integrity,\" talking about fraud now: because they wanna lay the groundwork for arguing that the election was unfair once the results have come in.\n\nWe see a lot of states being pressured to do things like get rid of their voting machines ahead of the election and get new voting machines. There are questions about the security.\n\nRosin: Wait, wait, so what's the problem with getting new voting machines? That seems like a good thing.\n\nGraham: It seems like a good thing if you have the money for it and if you have the time to train employees on it. But so many of these offices are working, basically, on a shoestring. The machines they have are basically functional.\n\nAnd the reasons Trump is questioning whether or not they're up to par don't really have to do with genuine security concerns. They seem to have to do with fomenting conspiracy theories about whether Venezuela or Italy is getting into the voting machines, as we saw in 2020.\n\nRosin: I see. So fake reasons to have new voting machines, the ultimate result of which is just making it more difficult for elections to go smoothly and everybody to vote.\n\nGraham: Right.This is just another variation on the false claims of fraud that we've seen from Trump since 2016. And they've already also seized voter rolls from local authorities, and they're claiming that there are a lot of people voting illegally.\n\nRosin: What about Democratic donors and candidates? What are we seeing there, and what could we see?\n\nGraham: We see attempts to basically intimidate them out of participation. You charge somebody like James Comey, you charge somebody like Letitia James with crimes, you attempt to investigate somebody like Senator Adam Schiff -- and you don't have to go after everyone. All you have to do is convince some people that it's not worth running, because they're going to become a target, or it's not worth running for a higher office, or it's not worth donating, since the White House is gonna know you gave that money. What if you lose? Is it really worth your while to put your neck out there?And what that does is that starts undermining the party's candidates, it undermines the party's major donors -- and you also undermine minor donors by, for example, launching an investigation into ActBlue, which is the heart of the Democratic small-dollar donation machine.\n\nRosin: And, we should say, James Comey and Letitia James, who you mentioned, have both pleaded not guilty in those cases.\n\nBut just to connect all the dots, how does that affect elections? How does something like that, this kind of low-simmering intimidation, ultimately affect a 2026 or any election?\n\nGraham: It means you may get worse candidates; the best candidates may decide that they don't want to run. It means they will be underfunded, potentially, compared to Republican candidates. It means they'll have to spend money on things like legal defense and time on things like legal defense instead of using that time to campaign.\n\nRosin: Okay, another aspect you've reported on is the Trump administration creating a new position to oversee future elections and then appointing a woman named Heather Honey, who has a history of election denial. So who is Heather Honey, and what effect could she have?\n\nGraham: So Heather Honey was one of these people involved in raising questions about the 2020 election. And now she is the Department of Homeland Security's top official for election integrity.\n\nRosin: So what could that mean?\n\nGraham: It's a little bit hard to know because -- and this, I think, is where a lot of these things get fuzzy. The federal government, in particular the executive branch, really don't have a lot of authority over elections. And what Trump is trying to do is claim that he has power to change things that he doesn't have.\n\nSo on the one hand, DHS might try to deem results unfair. We saw, in 2020, Trump saying to top officials at the Justice Department, Just say the election was unfair, and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen. And so you can imagine something like that. If DHS says that a tally was tainted, then that gives Trump an excuse to do a lot of other things.\n\nThe other problem is separate from Heather Honey. DHS -- and in particular, CISA, which oversees cybersecurity and infrastructure -- used to be a really important helper for a lot of local election authorities, who, they'd get walk-throughs that would tell them about: \"Where do you have physical vulnerabilities? Your power supply. Are your doors locking?\" They get help with cybersecurity.\n\nA lot of those things have been cut, so CISA has been cut drastically. And so not only are these local officials being pressured by, potentially, DHS, they're also not getting the help that they've traditionally gotten to make sure that systems are safe.\n\nRosin: So where does that put us in 2026?\n\nGraham: I think it puts us in a place where we need to be really wary and really nervous, but not a place of hopelessness.\n\nA lot of these things are scary. Something that you hear a lot from elections people is that free and fair is a spectrum. We've never had a perfectly free and fair election. Obviously, if you go back to before 1965, you have segregated Jim Crow elections, which are a very clear example, but there are always issues. But we're moving, potentially, in the wrong direction on free and fair, and in a major way.\n\nAnd we see the federal government trying to assert powers that it hasn't had. We see people who are trying to, effectively, sabotage elections getting into important positions, both at the local and national level.\n\nAll those things are bad. But I don't think they mean that we cannot have good elections, partly because the system is so diffuse that it makes it hard for someone to meddle with it all the way.\n\nAnd also, if people are paying attention -- whether that's officials being ready for interference or voters casting their ballots ahead of time and taking care of what they need to do -- there are a lot of ways that an election can still turn out pretty well, despite attempts to tilt the scales.\n\nRosin: Okay, so let's talk about those ways, 'cause what I hear you saying is election officials, also journalists, are saying, Be vigilant. There's this undercurrent trying to mess with elections. But there are also ways to push back against that.\n\nSo maybe we'll start by talking about the courts. In 2020, Trump and his allies filed something like 62 lawsuits contesting the election process and voter certification. Nearly all those were dismissed or dropped or not decided in Trump's favor. So are the courts one of these backstops that we can count on in the 2026 elections and beyond?\n\nGraham: They're a backstop that we need. Whether we can count on them, I think, is an open question, but there are positive signs. We have seen lower courts consistently ruling against things that Trump is doing that he simply doesn't have authority to do.\n\nAnd there's a lot of concern, especially from liberals, about the Supreme Court. But what I heard from election experts, including Democratic ones, was, look, first of all, most of these things don't make it to the Supreme Court. And second of all, the Supreme Court has been more tempered on voting issues than it has been on some things.\n\nSo there is, I would say, cautious optimism from a lot of people in the election space about the court as a backstop.\n\nRosin: What about state election officials? Because many of them did hold the line in 2020.\n\nGraham: It's a mixed bag. Some of the people who held the line really courageously have been forced out of office. They lost their elections. They were harassed so much, they decided to leave. And they've been replaced by people who are more Trump-friendly, and we don't know how they'll perform in the moment.\n\nEven when you have those people, though, the laws are the laws, and that's something that I think was important in 2020 as well. There were times where officials tried to do Trump's bidding and sort of get out of line, and they were often stopped by courts, which said, Hold on, you have no authority to do that. That's simply not how this works.\n\nRosin: Interesting. It does seem like a thin line of defense. A local election official who can get leaned on by DOJ or military pressure, it feels precarious.\n\nGraham: That's right. I talked to Stephen Richer, who was an official in Maricopa County, and he said it's just really hard when you're a local official trying to deal with pressure from the president of the United States and from members of your own party. All these people are pressuring you, and to hold the line against that is not easy to do.\n\nRosin: Okay, so 2026, fast-forwarding to that, where are you gonna be watching? Everyone watches Maricopa County, Arizona, always. (Laughs.) Are there other places where you'll be keeping an eye?\n\nGraham: I think that's the big one for me right now. And it's a little bit hard to know because so many of our districts are still in flux as these states work on these gerrymandering things.\n\nThe fact of the matter is there aren't that many districts that are actually competitive. We have already gerrymandered this country so far that we're probably only looking at a couple dozen, three dozen competitive House districts to decide control of the House. And so I think we'll know closer to the election what those districts are going to be.\n\nThe other thing I'm watching is just how many of them are really up. So I heard people telling me numbers like if it's a 10-seat difference in the race, it's very hard to steal that race. But if it's three to five races, it's a lot easier to get shenanigans in because there's not that many things to mess with, and you can sort of concentrate your energy, and you can maybe flip a couple of those, flip three of those, and that could make all the difference for House control.\n\nRosin: David, I would say that you and I've maybe painted a fairly bleak picture of elections to come for Democrats. However, this week was largely talked about as a moment of tremendous optimism for the party, like good news after a year of Trump running wild and doing whatever he wants to do. Do you see any strains of optimism about the upcoming year? How do you balance these two things?\n\nGraham: I think this election is a good sign for Trump critics. It shows that voters are really opposed to him, and it shows that they're willing to turn out even if they have hesitations about the Democratic Party writ large. A really broad margin like this would be really hard for Trump to cheat in 2026.\n\nThat said, none of this changes the balance of power between now and January 2027. And so that gives a lot of time for Trump to continue to abuse his powers, including doing things to make sure, or to try to make sure, that the 2026 elections are less fair. So a lot of the danger remains, even if there are some kind of hopeful signs for Democrats.\n\nIt's ultimately about democracy, and if people come out to vote, I think that triumphs over almost anything else. And we saw people doing that this week.\n\nRosin: This episode of Radio Atlantic was produced by Rosie Hughes. It was edited by Kevin Townsend.

        "description": "Democratic presidential hopefuls have visited key early or battleground states.\n\nOne year out from the 2026 midterms, major Democratic Party names have been taking the show on the road, saying that they're helping the party lay the groundwork to battle for the U.S. House.\n\nThey also might be preparing to run for president.\n\nABC News has tracked at least 24 visits by Democratic presidential hopefuls to the campaign trail in the key 2025 elections that Democrats swept -- New Jersey and Virginia's gubernatorial races, New York City's mayoral election, and California's redistricting ballot proposition election.\n\nSeparately, ABC News has tracked at least 43 visits or planned visits so far in 2025 and 2026 by Democratic presidential hopefuls to key early or battleground presidential election states. Some of those states are also expected to be key House battlegrounds in 2026.\n\nThe early and battleground state count excludes if the state is their home state and does not count multiple visits by the same candidate.\n\n\"Anybody who's looking at the 2028 cycle is starting to head out on the road ... Putting an emphasis on states that could determine control of the House is your best bet, and probably should be your only focus between now and the midterms,\" Sawyer Hackett, a veteran Democratic strategist who worked on presidential campaigns for Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and Julian Castro, told ABC News.\n\n2025 election states: New Jersey, Virginia, California, New York City\n\nIn New Jersey, Democratic candidate and U.S. Rep. Mikie Sherrill received support on the trail from a crowd of presidential hopefuls, including former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, former Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, Arizona Sen. Ruben Gallego, Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly, California Rep. Ro Khanna, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker and Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.\n\nAnd in Virginia, Democratic candidate and former U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger had the support of Beshear, Buttigieg, Emanuel, Gallego, Kelly, Khanna, Moore, Shapiro, and Whitmer.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom, former Vice President Kamala Harris, and Klobuchar separately stumped for \"Proposition 50\" in California, while Khanna and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez stumped for Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani in New York City.\n\nKey early states: Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina\n\nSome of the presidential hopefuls have flocked to states with early nominating contests. The Democratic Party is currently reevaluating its calendar for when those early contests will occur, but Hackett said Democrats hoping to run are still covering their bases.\n\nIowa, which usually boasts first-in-the-nation caucuses, will host a closely watched Senate race next year. The state also has some competitive House seats.\n\nIowa hosted former Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz in March and Buttigieg for a town hall in May, while Gallego visited in August and Emanuel came by in September. Kelly is set to visit in November, while Maryland Sen. Chris Van Hollen spoke to Iowa Democrats in September.\n\nNew Hampshire, which holds the nation's first presidential primaries and will hold a contested U.S. Senate race in 2026 for the seat being vacated by Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, has hosted several lawmakers. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear visited earlier this month; Gallego and Khanna stopped by in August; Klobuchar was there in July and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker will visit in November.\n\nWhen Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker visited in April, he painted a dire picture for his party.\n\n\"Fellow Democrats, for far too long, we've been guilty of listening to a bunch of do-nothing political types who would tell you that America's house is not on fire, even as the flames were licking their faces,\" Pritzker said.\n\nSouth Carolina, meanwhile, also has an early presidential primary. This year, it saw visits from Beshear, Khanna and Newsom in July -- who told rural residents \"what we're experiencing is America in reverse.\"\n\nKelly visited in September, while Maryland Gov. Wes Moore and Walz visited in late May for South Carolina Rep. Jim Clyburn's \"Fish Fry\" event, which has often been fertile waters for would-be Pennsylvania Avenue hopefuls.\n\nBoth Walz and Moore have told ABC News previously they are not \"running\" for president or have no plans to run.\n\nBattleground states: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin\n\nSeveral 2028 presidential hopefuls have also made their way around the seven battleground states, which have been considered winnable by either party and have an outsized influence on where campaigns place their resources.\n\nA few potential candidates have or plan to pay visits to Arizona, including Ocasio-Cortez, who visited in March as part of the Fighting Oligarchy tour run by independent Sen. Bernie Sanders. Whitmer visited in March, while Booker visited in April and Buttigieg visited in October. Harris, who recently said she'll \"possibly\" run for president again, will be speaking there in April 2026.\n\nArizona has two congressional seats currently held by Republicans viewed as competitive, according to the Cook Political Report.\n\nGeorgia is often the site of both a close presidential race and critical down-ballot races. Khanna visited in August, while Harris made a stop there on her book tour in October.\n\nFurther north, Moore and Khanna have paid visits this year to the battleground state of Michigan, where both President Donald Trump and Democratic Senate candidate Elissa Slotkin won in 2024.\n\nPennsylvania is also a key battleground state. Moore delivered a commencement address at Lincoln University in Gettysburg in May, the same month Gallego and Khanna paid their own visits. Notably, two Republicans in Pennsylvania, Reps. Scott Perry and Ryan Mackenzie, are expecting to face fierce fights to hold onto their seats.\n\nKhanna recently said the party's focus is to win back control of the House, which has a Republican majority.\n\n\"We have already a number of great candidates for 2028 that'll emerge, but right now the focus has to be to take back the House in terms of political priority,\" Khanna told public media organization WHYY.",

        "title": "Republicans are now deathly afraid of Trump  --  but just as scared of dumping him",
        "description": "Following the returns coming in, it was exhilarating, an experience that helped counter what we felt in 2024.\n\nSo yes, on a personal, psychological level, this will fuel us for the enormous work ahead. And this built on No Kings, which again points to the importance of organizing.\n\nBut we also surely needed this politically, to counter Trump and the GOP -- and the corporate media, which is always pandering to the GOP.\n\nMikie Sherrill, winning by double digits in the New Jersey race for governor, killed the narrative of New Jersey as drifting toward the GOP. The pollsters and the pundits had a big upset, telling us it was going to be single digits and MAGA Jack Ciatterelli could win. Black and Latino voters, who the media told us had strayed to Trump, voted in big percentages for Sherrill.\n\nIn the Virginia gubernatorial race, the spread for Abigail Spanberger's trouncing was also bigger than predicted, and the GOP harping on a texting scandal didn't stop Jay Jones from becoming attorney general. The House of Delegates is seeing double-digit pickups for Democrats. Virginia, a true bellwether, is a massive blow to the GOP.\n\nCalifornian organized fiercely within a matter of two months, led by Governor Gavin Newsom, and voted to fight Trump and Texas by redistricting their congressional map. It was a stunning turnaround -- so rapidly -- and an understanding of the stakes.\n\nNewsom gave a powerful speech, letting Trump know we will not accept his authoritarian rule. And Newsom implored other Democratic states to follow suit with redistricting -- and I think they will.\n\nAnd in New York, Zorhan Mamdani brings a whole new generation to City Hall, as voters decided it was no more business as usual with the same old corrupt politicians. He ran on affordability, as the other Democrats did, hitting the GOP and Trump for only continuing to enrich the billionaires. Mamdani is also a model for Democrats across the country in how to engage with voters, and he sent a message to Democratic leadership: It's time for change. Much will be written on that.\n\nMamdani's acceptance speech, rather than being conciliatory, was fiery and defiant -- the right stance for this moment -- as he spoke directly to Trump, telling him to \"turn up the volume\" to listen, and then letting him know he will have a big fight on his hands if he comes for us. Pitch perfect.\n\nSo, let's celebrate these big wins, and the fact that two women elected as governor, and an immigrant -- the first Muslim and South Asian elected to be New York's mayor -- won the marquee races.\n\nWe needed it. And the GOP, Trump and the media needed to see it. Our opponents are now on the defensive. Republicans will fret, deathly afraid of what Trump will do to their chances -- but also deathly afraid of what he'll do if they pull away from him. That's exactly where we want them moving into the 2026 midterm elections.",

        "title": "The U.S. Is Skipping This Year's Climate Summit. For Many, That's OK.",
        "description": "World leaders, gathering in Brazil, will try to agree on new, more ambitious plans to cut greenhouse gases.\n\nFor the first time since countries began gathering 30 years ago to wrestle with global warming, the United States will not send any top government officials to the annual United Nations climate summit, which kicks off on Thursday in Bel\u00e9m, Brazil.\n\nAnd that is just fine with those who see the Trump administration's hostility toward anything related to climate change as a menace to international cooperation on global warming.\n\n\"I normally subscribe to the idea that we should always be at the table,\" said Senator Brian Schatz, Democrat of Hawaii. \"But if we're going to be at the table and turn it over, then I think it's best if we don't show up.\"\n\nNot only has the Trump administration abandoned America's promises to the rest of the world that it would control the greenhouse gas pollution that is dangerously heating the planet, it has been pressuring other countries to similarly back away from efforts to fight climate change.\n\nThe administration has teamed up with other oil-producing nations to oppose a global plastics treaty and to compel Europe to abandon a climate law. It has also torpedoed the first-ever global fee on carbon pollution in the shipping industry. President Trump lectured world leaders at the United Nations in September, telling them if they did not \"get away from this green scam, your country is going to fail.\"\n\nLaurence Tubiana, who has served as France's climate negotiator and now runs the European Climate Foundation, a research organization, said she has been shocked by the \"level of aggressiveness\" with which Mr. Trump and his cabinet secretaries have opposed Europe's climate goals.\n\nThat has prompted some to say discussions could go more smoothly in Brazil without the United States, even though U.S. delegates have played a central role in designing climate agreements over three decades and the country arguably bears special responsibility as the world's biggest polluter in historical terms.\n\nUnited Nations climate summits require consensus, so one country can crater an entire agreement. That's led some to fear that a team from the Trump administration could block even incremental progress in Bel\u00e9m.\n\n\"We are really concerned about the potential damage that can come from the U.S. delegation,\" said Alejandra L\u00f3pez Carbajal, a former climate negotiator for a group of Latin American countries who now leads climate diplomacy for Transforma, a research organization based in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia.\n\nUnder the 2015 Paris climate agreement, the United States and 197 other countries made voluntary pledgesUnited States and 197 other countries in a voluntarily pledge to hold average global temperature rise to \"well below\" 2 degrees Celsius, and preferably closer to 1.5 degrees, compared to preindustrial levels. The world has already warmed about 1.3 degrees Celsius.\n\nEvery fraction of a degree of additional warming could mean tens of millions more people worldwide exposed to dangerous heat waves, wildfires, water and food shortages, and coastal flooding, scientists have said.\n\nAt the gathering that starts Thursday at the edge of the Amazon in Bel\u00e9m, countries are expected to deliver new, more ambitious plans to cut the carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases they emit.\n\nMs. Tubiana said the rest of the world would persevere without the Americans. From here on out, she said, \"we have to act with or without the U.S.\"\n\nThis year's summit is set to begin with two days of speeches from heads of state and government, followed by about two weeks of negotiations among foreign ministers and other senior diplomats from about 140 countries.\n\nNot only is the White House not sending high level representatives, it may not send any technical staff, either. It has been clear for months that Mr. Trump, who is withdrawing the United States from the Paris Agreement, never seriously considered making an appearance.\n\n\"President Trump will not jeopardize our country's economic and national security to pursue vague climate goals that are killing other countries,\" said Taylor Rogers, a White House spokeswoman, echoing language Mr. Trump used at the United Nations General Assembly in September, when he claimed that countries pursuing clean energy \"would fail.\"\n\nThe pullout of the Americans, and the vacuum that has created, may be one reason some world leaders are skipping the climate talks this year. Those expected to stay home include Anthony Albanese of Australia; Xi Jinping of China; Vladimir V. Putin of Russia; Sanae Takaichi of Japan; Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey; Prabowo Subianto of Indonesia and Pope Leo.\n\nStill, a group of about 100 American leaders, mostly Democratic state and local officials, is expected in Brazil to send a message that mayors, governors and business leaders still prioritize climate change even if Mr. Trump does not. Gov. Gavin Newsom of California, a Democrat who has emerged as President Trump's chief antagonist, announced on Wednesday that he would attend the talks in Bel\u00e9m.\n\n\"As the president of the United States turns his back on people and the planet, California is inking global partnerships focused on creating jobs and cutting toxic pollution,\" Mr. Newsom said in a statement.\n\nSeveral big companies -- including GE Vernova, Bank of America and Bayer -- also will be on the ground, said Marty Durbin, who leads the energy institute at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n\n\"The business community hasn't walked away from this, even with the Trump administration minimizing it and pulling out,\" Mr. Durbin said.\n\nBecause of the federal government shutdown, some Democratic lawmakers may pay their own way to attend as part of the Sustainable Energy and Environment Caucus, said Max Frankel, director of the nonprofit arm of the caucus. Other members of Congress, including Senator John Curtis, a Utah Republican, have said they were forced to cancel their plans for Bel\u00e9m entirely.\n\nThe absence of an official American delegation is a departure from previous Republican administrations.\n\nIn 2001 the United States withdrew from the Kyoto Protocol, the world's first global climate agreement, which had been signed three years earlier by President Bill Clinton. But the George W. Bush administration still participated in annual talks.\n\nAnd even when Mr. Trump first withdrew from the Paris Agreement, during his first term in 2017, he continued to send high ranking State Department officials to the U.N. climate summits to at least nod toward the need to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nIn the ensuing years, during which President Joseph R. Biden Jr. returned the United States to the Paris accord, Mr. Trump's hostility to all things related to climate hardened. Now surrounded by loyalists, Mr. Trump has also declared that he seeks fossil fuels dominant globally, and he attacks any policies that could harm U.S. coal, oil or gas interests.\n\nMr. Trump has signed multiple trade deals that require Japan, Korea, the European Union and other trading partners to buy billions of dollars worth of gas from the United States.\n\nIn August the Trump administration aligned with Saudi Arabia to scuttle an international limit on the production of plastics, which are made from petroleum. Last month the United States and Qatar joined forces to oppose European Union sustainability rules that require companies to identify and address the adverse environmental impacts of their actions.\n\nThat came on the heels of what is perhaps the Trump administration's greatest anti-climate triumph: joining Saudi Arabia and Russia to thwart what would have been the first-ever global fee on shipping emissions. Trump administration officials openly threatened countries with tariffs and levies if they supported the carbon fee and later boasted of having deployed an \"all hands on deck\" pressure campaign.\n\nSome argue the fear of maneuvering by the United States to impede climate talks is overblown. For one thing, there's almost no one remaining in the State Department who knows the intricate U.N. process, since many employees were fired, reassigned or accepted offers to leave the government.\n\nUnder U.N. rules, the United States is still technically a party to the Paris Agreement until Jan. 27. It also remains a member of the U.N. body that convenes nations annually to monitor global progress on tackling climate change.\n\nConservatives and others who oppose efforts to address climate change also want the United States to stay away from Bel\u00e9m.\n\nSeventeen Republican attorneys general, led by John McCuskey of West Virginia, sent a letter to the administration last month arguing that sending a delegation \"would do little more than lend credibility\" to the global climate talks.\n\n\"At a time when demand for energy is greater than ever, the prior administration embraced COP policies that dismantled -- rather than supported -- coal, oil, and gas production,\" the attorneys general wrote. \"The COP and other international actors favor less reliable and more expensive renewable energy sources, and that preference has proven harmful to American energy stability.\"\n\nSenator Jim Justice, a West Virginia Republican whose family owns several coal companies, said he did not have a strong position on whether the United States should take part in the talks. But with energy demand rising, in part because of the rapid growth of data centers, a transition away from fossil fuels threatens American security, he said.\n\n\"We know that we're going to have an energy meltdown in this country and we have got to have our fossil fuels today like crazy,\" Mr. Justice said. \"If you knew you had to have your fossil fuels like crazy would it make sense to go to a climate change summit? Maybe not.\"",

        "title": "Massachusetts Gov. Healey backs AG in war of words with U.S. Attorney over ICE masks",
        "description": "Massachusetts AG Andrea Campbell is in a war of words with U.S. Attorney Leah Foley over ICE agents wearing masks on the job, a concept that Gov. Maura Healey says \"doesn't make sense.\"\n\nThe governor's comments come as Foley finds herself on the defensive after Campbell said banning federal agents from wearing masks should be a priority of the federal office.\n\nAppearing on GBH's Boston Public Radio, Healey said that she'd fully support ICE and President Donald Trump's deportation agenda if it were \"actually about going after violent guys and taking them off the streets.\"\n\n\"But that's not what is going on,\" the governor said on Wednesday. \"This is what I encourage people to do: Continue to film, continue to document, continue to share the stories about what's happening. People are fed up with ... how Trump is abusing ICE.\"\n\nHealey's radio appearance came just over 12 hours after Foley released a scathing statement on social media following Campbell's own appearance on the same show the day before.\n\nThe AG said she believes a proposed law at the State House that seeks to ban federal immigration agents from wearing face coverings while on duty is better left up to the federal level.\n\n\"Why? Because to ... implement that against ICE officials, [it is] nearly impossible,\" Campbell said on Tuesday. \"And I don't mince my words there.\"\n\nCampbell added that her office is tracking ICE activities for \"possible racial profiling\" with the \"hopes that maybe if there's something that we can hold them accountable for, we will.\" She called on Bay Staters to seek accountability of ICE from the Massachusetts U.S. Attorney.\n\n\"That's your U.S. Attorney's job,\" Campbell said. \"They're not doing that. It's just very difficult to enforce. My thing is, we don't want to just be passing things for the sake of passing things.\"\n\n\"Even if we were to try to hold them accountable in attempting to even do that, if we were to arrest an ICE official, it's very difficult,\" the AG added. \"The judge might even throw it out because of federalism. But what's worse is retaliation and retribution coming from this federal administration is very real.\"\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement have said that ICE officers are grappling with a massive increase in assaults against them, around 830%.\n\n\"I would hope that the Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Campbell understands that it is the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution that prohibits her from arresting federal officers for doing their jobs,\" Foley said in a statement posted on the Massachusetts U.S. Attorney's social media pages Tuesday night. \"It is disappointing to hear her say that our country's Constitution is not on her 'side.'\n\n\"I have stated repeatedly that ICE agents are masked due to incidents of doxing and threats against them and their families,\" she added, \"The attorney general apparently is less mindful of these documented significant threats than she is of murky, unverified accounts of retribution.\"\n\nThe war of words between Campbell and Foley also comes as the FBI has urged partner agencies to \"adequately identify themselves\" amid a stretch of incidents where impersonators pretending to be ICE officers have committed crimes.\n\nCalifornia became the first state to ban most law enforcement officers, including federal immigration agents, from covering their faces while conducting official business under a bill that Gov. Gavin Newsom signed in September.\n\nThe ban is a direct response to recent immigration raids in Los Angeles, where federal agents wore masks while making mass arrests. The raids prompted days of protest and led President Donald Trump to deploy National Guard troops and Marines to the area.\n\nSenate President Karen Spilka said late last month that she backs the proposed ban on federal agents wearing mask coverings, equating the practice to \"almost like the 1930s Germany.\"\n\nHealey said on her monthly radio appearance that she wants Bay Staters to be aware that local police and the Massachusetts State Police do not wear masks. She added that she wishes officers at the local, state, and federal levels were all held to the same standards.\n\n\"They wear a badge, they are identified by name and number,\" Healey said of local and state police. \"It doesn't make sense to a lot of people that (the feds) are somehow allowed to have a different standard.\"\n\nFoley slammed Campbell for going public with a story about Healey thanking airport workers for working without pay during the government shutdown, which the AG claimed sparked a \"union meeting ... where they were maybe chastised or something.\"\n\n\"In defense of my federal partners,\" Foley said, \"I can say that her version of what happened is completely false and the facts will come out.\"\n\n\"The attorney general is welcome to share her opinions and tall tale stories (even she admits she does not know all the facts and conveniently maligns to fill the voids),\" Foley added, \"but her overtly political and inaccurate statements only fuel the misinformation and fear that she purportedly seeks to quell.\"\n\nEarlier this year, Foley slammed Boston Mayor Michelle Wu for \"reckless and inflammatory statements\" about federal immigration authorities in an interview in which Wu equated agents to \"secret police.\"",

        "title": "Lucas: Though not on ballot, Trump took a beating",
        "description": "Donald Trump may not have been on the ballot, but he got clobbered anyway.\n\nHe lost everywhere -- in New York City, in New Jersey, in Virginia and in California.\n\nGranted Trump did not personally campaign for the losing Republican gubernatorial candidates in New Jersey or Virginia, or for Andrew Cuomo, an independent, in New York City, but he endorsed them, whether by name or by party. And they all lost.\n\nIn the New York mayoral contest, which Democratic Socialist Zohran Mamdani won handily, Trump in his support of Andrew Cuomo said he'd rather see a \"bad Democrat\" (Cuomo) as mayor than a \"Communist\" (Mamdani).\n\nAnd while he took no strong public role in California, Democrat Gov. Gavin Newsom's Proposition 50 plan to gerrymander the state midterm to wipe out Republican congressional districts, its passage was also a setback for Trump and the Republicans.\n\nThe proposition was proposed by Newsom to counter a similar midterm redistricting plan in Texas which favors the Republicans. Newsom is considered by some to be a viable candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2028.\n\nDespite his endorsement, Democratic gubernatorial candidates Mikie Sherrill beat Republican Jack Ciattarelli in New Jersey and Abigail Spanberger defeated Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears in Virginia.\n\nTrump endorsed both Ciattarelli and Earle-Sears (but not by name) but did not actively campaign for them.\n\nMeanwhile, former President Barack Obama, who has been accused of having no political coattails, not only endorsed Sherrill in New Jersey and Spanberger in Virginia but actively hit the campaign trail for them.\n\nWhile Obama did not officially endorse the controversial Mamdani, he did telephone him just before the election. While the conversation was not made public, in a statement obtained by the Times, Mamdani spokesperson Dora Pekec said that \"Zohran Mamdani appreciated President Obama's words of support and their conversation on the importance of bringing a new kind of politics to our city.\"\n\nIt also gave the shrewd Obama the option of denying any endorsement in the event Mamdani lost.\n\nThe Spanberger victory in Virginia gives Democrats back control of the state currently run by Republican Glenn Youngkin, who was term-limited.\n\nSherrill, meanwhile, will succeed Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy in New Jersey, who was also term-limited.\n\nBoth Spanberger and Sherrill attacked Trump throughout their campaigns as though Trump were on the ballot, as did Mamdani in New York and Newsom in California.\n\nWhile both New Jersey and Virginia are Democratic majority states, Republicans hoped for upsets, especially in New Jersey.\n\nBut it was not to be.\n\nCiattarelli ran worse than he did four years ago when he was beaten for governor by Murphy.\n\nDemocrats in Virginia even narrowly elected Democrat Jay Jones for attorney general over Republican incumbent Jason Miyares, who Trump also endorsed.\n\nJones is known for his sick text messages that he wanted to shoot Todd Gilbert, then-Virginia GOP House Speaker. \"Three people, two bullets,\" he texted in 2022, \"Gilbert, hitler, pol pot. Gilbert gets two bullets to the head.\" Virginia Democrats elected him anyway.\n\nWhile Jones apologized for the texts, he could have also warned politicians not to text late at night, something Trump does regularly, which he also did following Tuesday's election results.\n\nThe president posted: \"Trump was not on the ballot and (government) shutdown were the two reasons that Republicans lost election tonight.\"\n\nTrump might have added that they lost because he was too busy running the country and the world to campaign for them.\n\nThere is no Trumpism without Trump.",

        "title": "Reality check: Democrats celebrate, Trump deflects blame, Mamdani under fire",
        "description": "THE RESULTS ARE IN: 2025'S BIGGEST WINNER AND LOSERS FROM THE OFF-YEAR ELECTIONS\n\nPerhaps the most important thing that happened with the Democrats winning big in the off-year elections is the psychological boost. The Democrats haven't had anything to celebrate for a year. Now, they're high-fiving themselves. This is clearly a protest against President Donald Trump and Trumpism, which makes the victory a little sweeter.\n\nTwo women had especially big nights. In New Jersey, Mikie Sherrill is the new governor-elect. In Virginia, Abigail Spanberger is the commonwealth's first female governor-elect. Hell, even Jay \"two bullets\" Jones, who sent those awful texts about wanting to kill the then-House speaker, won his race for Virginia Attorney General.\n\nIf you live in those states, your life may change a bit.\n\nBut, it's also a reminder that politics is not just about policy. Sure, the Democrats were shrewd to run on affordability, given that the president had promised to bring prices down. But ultimately, voters want someone they feel comfortable with, someone who can deal with unforeseen crises.\n\nYet on the national front, Trump still controls the White House. He still controls the House. He still controls the Senate. He's largely backed by the Supreme Court, despite skepticism at yesterday's oral argument about whether tariffs fall under his emergency powers.\n\nSo what has really changed?\n\nThe continuing government shutdown fueled a sense of frustration and impatience with the president, as he acknowledged in that terse response to the GOP losses -- which extended to California, where Gavin Newsom pushed through a redistricting plan in response to Republican gerrymandering.\n\nKEY TAKEAWAYS FROM THE 2025 ELECTIONS\n\nTrump was quick to note that he wasn't on the ballot. But, in a very real sense, he was on every ballot.\n\nThe media invariably overinterpret these off-year elections in two left-leaning states. Trump sensed disaster so he just opted out, not wanting to be tainted by the coming losses.\n\nBut he's still got all his power.\n\nLet's imagine it's six months from now and the shutdown, now the longest in American history, is a distant memory. Let's say the economy has improved somewhat -- a big if, to be sure. Who knows whether that means the Democrats will romp in the midterms?\n\nJoe Biden suffered no midterm losses when predictions of a blue wave never materialized. Barack Obama lost the House in his first midterm, and then lost the Senate in his second midterm. George W. Bush lost the House in his second midterm, making Nancy Pelosi speaker. Trump lost the House in his first midterm, in 2018.\n\nBush called it a \"thumpin',\" Obama a \"shellacking.\"\n\nIt's just too early to say whether Trump will suffer a similar fate in next year's midterm elections, when Democrats would only need to pick up a handful of seats to take control.\n\nThe other unfolding drama is in the media capital, where Zohran Mamdani was elected New York City's first Muslim mayor, beating Andrew Cuomo for the second time. Cuomo refused to make the traditional concession call, a petty move that was beneath him.\n\nTalk about the power of personality. The obscure assemblyman, who's never run anything, is a self-described socialist who started at 1 percent in the polls. He is beloved by younger people and put together a coalition that somehow combined wide-eyed liberals with working-class immigrants in Brooklyn and Queens.\n\nMamdani did blunder by making a fiery speech, almost yelling at times, rather than a more inclusive one.\n\nWHAT THE RESULTS OF THE 2025 ELECTIONS MAY MEAN FOR DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS\n\nHe fared poorly among Jewish liberals, who are upset by his refusal to recognize Israel's right to exist as a Jewish state, and threatend to arrest Israeli Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu if he comes to the U.N.\n\nThe mayor-elect will inevitably fail to fulfill many of his promises-free buses, free child care, free everything -- because he won't have the power and needs help from Albany. And some of his past comments from his defund-the-police, abolish-ICE days would have sunk a less charismatic candidate.\n\nMamdani now has 81 percent name recognition, in keeping with the high profile of New York City mayors, from John Lindsay and Ed Koch to Rudy Giuliani, Mike Bloomberg and Bill de Blasio.\n\nAOC is thrilled, but it's the Republicans who couldn't be happier.\n\nThe National Republican Congressional Committee just launched a digital ad against Mamdani, which is running in nearly 50 swing districts.\n\n\"A radical left earthquake just hit America. The epicenter: New York,\" the spot says.\n\nThey had already been campaigning against Mamdani in trying to make him the face of an increasingly left-wing party. Some starry-eyed supporters see socialism as the answer, but it hardly plays as well in Butte or Baton Rouge as in the Bronx.\n\nCircling back to Trump, who slams Mamdani as a communist: Does he moderate a bit? Not his style.\n\nHe is always about firing up his base and the party he has remade in his image, even if Hill Republicans are resisting his demand to abolish the filibuster.\n\nCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe media are heavily anti-Trump, and in a visceral way, especially since their corporate owners keep settling his lawsuits. That's why you're seeing so many on-air smiles as they replayed the victory speeches all day long.\n\nBut these early proclamations of Trump's inevitable demise may well turn out to be exaggerated.",

        "description": "In California's San Joaquin County, one year after voting favorably for President Trump over Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election, those same voters appear to be reversing course, voting in line with Democrats on Proposition 50.\n\nCBS News projects California voters passed Proposition 50, a measure backed by legislative Democrats and Gov. Gavin Newsom that will redraw the state's congressional districts to be more favorable to Democrats ahead of next year's midterm elections following a similar redistricting push in Texas that favors Republicans.\n\nSan Joaquin County election numbers as of Wednesday afternoon show 53% of voters said \"yes\" to Proposition 50, siding with Democrats in the push to approve the measure. In last year's election, voters in the county aligned with Republicans, with 48.9% voting for Mr. Trump over 48.0% for Harris.\n\nUnited Farmworkers spokesperson Antonio De Loera said the Latino population, the largest demographic in the county, is making all the difference in the outcome of recent elections there.\n\n\"Latino voters are swing voters now,\" he said.\n\nDe Loera said the San Joaquin County vote for Mr. Trump a year ago was about the economy, an issue he said the president is no longer winning with Latinos now.\n\n\"One of the big stories in the 2024 election was that Donald Trump and Republicans did in fact make big gains with Latinos,\" he said. \"Those gains have clearly not been permanent. What we're seeing now is a swing back.\"\n\nFormer San Joaquin County Republican Party chair Bishop Dwight Williams, a Trump supporter, said he believes the county is in new political territory: neither red nor blue.\n\nWilliams said the passage of Proposition 50 is not indicative of how voters in the county feel about the Republican Party.\n\n\"You had millions of dollars spent on the 'yes' side versus the 'no' side,\" he said.\n\nCounties have 30 days to finish counting the ballots. That's when we'll get a final official breakdown of how San Joaquin County voted on Proposition 50.\n\nStill, Williams admits the Election Day result was a disappointment.\n\n\"Obviously, we had hoped for a different outcome,\" he said.",

        "description": "Donald Trump's dramatic, four-word salvo on Truth Social just before midnight Tuesday means he knows the honeymoon is over.\n\nAfter thumping wins by radical Democrats -- a tautology now, of course -- the battle lines are clear.\n\nThe president knows he has just one year until the midterms to \u00adfireproof his agenda and safeguard \u00adfuture elections against Democrat fraud.\n\nThat's why he wants to end the filibuster.\n\nThe 60-vote Senate threshold is strangling Republican priorities and is allowing Democrats to shut down the government for the fifth week while blaming Trump.\n\nYet too many Senate Republicans don't know what time it is.\n\nThey are clinging to outdated niceties that Democrats are itching to blow up as soon as they get their hands back on the reins -- which will be soon if the GOP old guard doesn't wake up.\n\nTrump has always known what time it is, from the day he glided into history aboard his golden escalator and was targeted for destruction every which way for the last 10 years.\n\nThat's why in every election they contested Tuesday, Democrats used Trump as their bogeyman.\n\nOne year ago Trump scored crushing victories across the board, winning the Electoral College, the popular vote, the House, the Senate, and every swing state, and gaining ground in nearly every demographic and region.\n\nAmerica rejected Democrats' menu, even after Dems jettisoned Joe Biden: the DEI liberal Kamala Harris and her running mate, the conservative-coded, gun totin' liberal dad Tim Walz.\n\nBut this time Democrats offered two new flavors: a Muslim immigrant communist for the big blue city and white liberal \"national security moms\" for the white-flight suburbs.\n\nThey had one thing in common: hating Donald Trump.\n\n\"Here in New Jersey, we know that this nation has not ever been, nor will it ever be, ruled by kings,\" said Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill, a former federal prosecutor and Navy helicopter pilot in her victory speech after winning the race for New Jersey governor.\n\nSherrill was the mirror image of Abigail Spanberger, the former CIA officer who won Virginia's gubernatorial race and helped her AG running mate Jay Jones over the line, despite his fantasies of murdering a Republican rival and his children.\n\nTheir national security credentials, pleasant middle-aged suburban-mom appearances, and moderate-sounding rhetoric reassured voters alarmed by rising crime and the Democrat embrace of sexual fetishes.\n\nOf course both candidates, despite having daughters, are in favor of males in female change rooms.\n\nIn Trump's hometown, Zohran Mamdani pitched himself as the president's worst nightmare.\n\nIt won him a squeak over 50% of the vote, despite his humble-brag admission that he is \"far from the perfect candidate. I am young .\u2009.\u2009. I am Muslim. I am socialist. And most damning of all, I refuse to apologize for any of this.\"\n\nIn his coldly triumphalist victory speech in Brooklyn's Paramount Theater ballroom Tuesday night, Mamdani dropped his smiley mask and addressed Trump directly.\n\n\"Donald Trump, since I know you're watching, I have four words for you: turn the volume up,\" he shouted, to the roaring delight of his supporters.\n\n\"New York will remain a city of immigrants, a city built by immigrants, powered by immigrants, and as of tonight, led by an immigrant.\n\nEvery week, Post columnist Miranda Devine sits down for exclusive and candid conversations with the most influential disruptors in Washington. Subscribe here!\n\n\"So hear me President Trump when I say this: to get to any of us, you will have to get through all of us.\"\n\nRight out of the gate, the anti-cop mayor-elect has set the table to challenge Trump on law and order.\n\nHe joins Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, and a cabal of Democrat leaders, like our own Gov. Hochul, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass and California Gov. Gavin Newsom in opposing federal immigration enforcement operations in blue sanctuary cities.\n\nThe president threatened to cut funding to New York if Mandani was elected and send in the National Guard to enforce immigration law and combat crime.\n\nAnd so he should.\n\nSadly for those of us who did not choose this fate, the president should show no mercy to his hometown.\n\nWhy should voters in Missouri pay to bail out New York?\n\nTrump loves New York and is loath to hurt it -- but if Mamdani won't work with him, he has no choice.\n\nLet the Mamdani experiment sink on its own and be an object lesson for the nation.\n\nMamdani will blame Trump for his policies not working either way.\n\nThe city's affordability problem is due largely to Democrat policies.\n\nVirtual decriminalization of shoplifting makes groceries more expensive, overregulation strangles developers, landlords and small business with red tape and crippling taxes.\n\nExhibit A is \u00adHochul's congestion tax.\n\nMamdani won the biggest margins with immigrants who have moved to the city within the last 10 years and don't have much skin in the game, and with voters under 45.\n\nYou can hardly blame young(ish) people for voting for Mamdani.\n\nAs Democrat voters all they see is octogenarians squatting in power.\n\nThey were lied to about Biden's senility and then the \"Nazi\" they were told is an existential threat to humanity won office.\n\nWhy wouldn't they want to burn down the house.\n\nThey can't afford to buy their own house, settle down and partake of the American dream.\n\nThe alternative -- Andrew Cuomo -- was more of the worn-out same.\n\nThe only demographic that did not majority-vote for Mamdani was white men.\n\nThat's why they have been demonized and demoralized and relegated to the margins.\n\nThat process will only accelerate, with AI set to destroy millions of jobs within a decade.\n\nAffordability was Mamdani's magic word, though his ideology ensures he will never deliver.\n\nAffordability needs to become the Republican mantra, too.\n\nNo more Bidenesque gaslighting about how we are living in a golden era. People don't feel it.\n\nTrump got the memo, addressing a business forum Wednesday to trumpet news from Walmart that the average cost of a Thanksgiving meal is 25% lower than last year.\n\n\"We're making America afford\u00adable again,\" he said.\n\nVice President JD Vance echoed him in a tweet: \"We inherited a disaster from Joe Biden, and Rome wasn't built in a day. We're going to keep on working to make a decent life affordable in this country, and that's the metric by which we'll \u00adultimately be judged in 2026 and beyond.\"\n\nThat's why the filibuster must go, so Trump can turbocharge his promised economic boom and protect the rest of the country from Democrat destruction.",

The gambit was an exercise in political power and, coming outside of the traditional decennial redistricting process, without precedent in modern history.\n\nYet if Democrats feared not long ago that they would be locked out of a House majority, their decisive victories across the country last night have made them, arguably, the favorites heading into next year's midterm elections.\n\nIn California, an overwhelming majority voted to redistrict, essentially canceling out the five House seats that Republicans had thought they gained through redistricting in Texas over the summer. The GOP's steep losses farther east cast even more doubt on the wisdom of its redistricting push. Voters repudiated Republicans virtually across the board, handing Democrats convincing victories for the governorships of New Jersey and Virginia, important judicial and legislative races in Pennsylvania, and, for the first time in two decades, a pair of statewide elections in Georgia. In Virginia, the breadth of the Democrats' win gave them their largest majority in the state House of Delegates since 1989.\n\nRead: The anti-MAGA majority reemerges\n\nFor Democrats, the results were reminiscent of -- and in many cases stronger than -- the victories they posted during the 2017 elections, in Trump's first term, which presaged the wave that delivered them the House majority a year later. Even if the GOP's gerrymandering advantage nets the party a few additional seats, Democrats will have a narrower gap to overcome next year than they did eight years ago.\n\nAmong the constituencies that swung the hardest toward Democrats yesterday were Latinos, who helped power Trump's presidential win last year and were key to the GOP's redrawn congressional map in Texas. The Republicans' chances of flipping five additional House seats there rest in part on their holding Trump's gains among Latino voters. That was a questionable assumption from the start, the longtime GOP strategist Mike Madrid told me. It appears even shakier in light of Tuesday's election results; in New Jersey, for example, the state's three most heavily Latino counties moved sharply back to the left after swinging toward Trump in 2024.\n\n\"None of this is good for Republicans. It's all their own doing, though,\" Madrid said. Latinos in Texas border towns may vote differently in 2026 than Latinos in New Jersey did this year. But the anti-GOP shift in this week's elections could boost the Democrats' chances of winning two and possibly three of the five Texas seats that Republicans redrew in their favor, Madrid told me. It could also open up even more opportunities for Democrats, because to create the additional red-leaning seats, Republicans had to cut into previously safe GOP districts. \"The problem is they're spreading their other districts thin as they're getting greedy,\" Madrid said.\n\nYesterday's election results could complicate both parties' plans to escalate their gerrymandering tit-for-tat across the country. In addition to their Texas effort, Republicans have enacted newly drawn congressional maps in Missouri and North Carolina that could yield them an additional House seat in each state. Florida legislators are eyeing a gerrymander that could boost the GOP's chances in multiple seats, although the state's significant proportion of Latino voters could pose similar redistricting challenges for Republicans there as those in Texas saw.\n\nInternal opposition, however, has slowed the GOP's drive elsewhere. Ohio Republicans cut a deal with Democrats on revised districts that are more favorable for the GOP but not nearly as aggressive as some party leaders had advocated for. In Indiana, Republicans remain short of the votes they would need in the state legislature to gerrymander both of its House Democrats out of their seats, despite an intense pressure campaign from the White House. And just as polls were closing in eastern states last night, Kansas Republicans announced that they lacked support to call a special legislative session to redraw the House seat of Representative Sharice Davids, the lone Democrat in the state's congressional delegation.\n\nSome Democrats, meanwhile, were emboldened by the success of California's Proposition 50, the ballot measure devised by Governor Gavin Newsom that temporarily redraws the state congressional map to target five Republican-held House seats and strengthen five additional swing districts represented by Democrats. With 75 percent of precincts reporting today, the referendum was leading by more than 25 points. (Republicans immediately filed a lawsuit to block the new California maps, as they had promised to do if Prop 50 passed.) The GOP's \"biggest strategy for trying to steal the 2026 election is falling apart before their eyes,\" Ken Martin, the chair of the Democratic National Committee, told reporters on a conference call trumpeting the party's electoral wins.\n\nEven before Democrats swept Virginia's elections last night, the party's state legislative majorities began a two-year process to gerrymander two or three Republicans out of their House seats in the 2026 elections. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries has pushed Democratic leaders in Illinois and Maryland to similarly redraw their state's congressional maps. But the effort has met resistance from some Democratic lawmakers.\n\nIn Maryland, the state Senate president, Bill Ferguson, used the party's electoral success yesterday to argue against an attempt to draw a new map that would likely give Democrats all eight of its House seats. (Republicans currently hold one.) \"Tonight's resounding Democratic victory shows we don't need to rig the system to win,\" Ferguson wrote on X. His comment earned a sharp rebuttal from his counterpart in neighboring Virginia, the state Senate president pro tempore, L. Louise Lucas. \"Get our victory in Virginia out of your mouth while you echo MAGA talking points,\" she posted this afternoon. \"Grow a pair and stand up to this President. This is just embarrassing.\"\n\nRead: 'California is allowed to hit back'\n\nMartin said he hoped Tuesday's election results, and especially the Prop 50 vote in California, would \"send a chilling effect to Republicans\" who are trying to gerrymander more states. \"It's not going to net you enough seats to guarantee that you're going to control the U.S. House next year,\" he said. \"So knock it off now.\"\n\nThere was no signal from Republicans that they planned to abandon their efforts. Although Trump voiced disappointment in the election results, other party leaders dismissed them. \"There's no surprises. What happened last night was blue states and blue cities voted blue,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters outside the Capitol. \"Off-year elections are not indicative of what's to come.\" (The speaker had a different interpretation of the off-year elections four years ago, when they went the GOP's way: \"RED WAVE is coming,\" Johnson posted then.)\n\nOne GOP strategist, who was granted anonymity to candidly assess the party's performance, told me that yesterday's results were \"a wake-up call.\" But the strategist said Republicans remained \"full-steam ahead\" on their redistricting push in Florida.\n\nMadrid said the elections should send each party a message on redistricting. Republicans should \"pause and stop and contemplate. Say, 'Wait a second. Maybe we made a mistake here.'\" At the same time, Democrats should understand, he said, that they can win elections at the ballot box without sacrificing the moral high ground on gerrymandering. Madrid wasn't optimistic, however: \"There's a lesson for both parties in this, and neither one of them will learn it.\"",

        "title": "Hakeem Jeffries dodges question on whether Mamdani is future of Democratic Party",
        "description": "Following Zohran Mamdani's decisive mayoral victory in New York City on Tuesday, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., dodged a question on whether the self-proclaimed Democratic socialist is the future of the Democratic Party.\n\n\"You had record turnout in New York City for this election. Would you say that Mamdani is the future of the Democratic Party?\" a reporter asked Jeffries during Wednesday's press conference on Capitol Hill.\n\n\"Well, what Democrats have done all across the country is lean into the issue of affordability because of the fact that America's too expensive costs are too high, and Donald Trump and Republicans, not only have they not done anything about it, they've made it worse as a result of the Trump tariffs as a result of them detonating the clean energy economy,\" Jeffries responded.\n\n\"That's why electricity bills are skyrocketing. And now, of course, they're forcing these dramatically increased health care premiums to be visited upon the American people,\" he added.\n\nSOCIALIST SHOCKWAVE: ZOHRAN MAMDANI STUNS NYC AS VOTERS HAND POWER TO DEMOCRATS' FAR-LEFT FLANK\n\nJeffries was also asked whether he is personally comfortable having the city he represents, the most populous city in America, be run by a socialist.\n\nIn response, Jeffries simply answered that Mamdani \"is the mayor-elect of the City of New York,\" saying, \"It's incumbent upon everyone to make sure that he's successful.\"\n\nAlthough Mamdani was quickly endorsed by some of the country's most progressive leaders, such as Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., the Democratic Party's top leadership was slower to give their blessing. Jeffries himself did not answer whether he would be endorsing Mamdani until just before early voting began on Oct. 24. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., never issued an endorsement of Mamdani. However, he called his electoral victory \"historic.\"\n\nMamdani, who is a 34-year-old immigrant from Uganda, is the first Muslim mayor of New York City.\n\nWILL ELECTION DAY 2025 BE REMEMBERED AS THE RISE OF THE SOCIALISTS?\n\nDespite dodging these questions, Jeffries received an identical question earlier in the week about whether Mamdani is the future of the Democratic Party, prompting him to say, \"I think the future of the Democratic Party is going to fall, as far as we're concerned, relative to the House Democratic Caucus and members who are doing a great work all across the country as it relates to our need to both take back control of the House.\"\n\nJeffries called Tuesday night's election a \"big night for the American people\" and a \"big night for the Democratic Party.\"\n\nBesides New York City, Democrats also notched major victories in California, Virginia and New Jersey. He called the election results \"a decisive repudiation of Donald Trump and failed Republican policies.\"\n\nThis comes as the government shutdown over expiring Obamacare subsidies and healthcare benefits enters day 36, becoming the longest closure in U.S. history.\n\nSenate Democrats have voted 14 times to reject a House-passed continuing resolution budget bill that would reopen the government.\n\nDespite this, Jeffries indicated that he believes the Tuesday election showed the country is blaming President Donald Trump and Republicans for the shutdown and that more Democratic victories are in store in 2026.\n\nVANCE DELIVERS POST-ELECTION REALITY CHECK, CONTENDS GOP MUST MAKE LIFE AFFORDABLE OR GET WALLOPED IN 2026\n\n\"We're going to take back control of the United States House of Representatives. So, let's be very clear about that,\" he said. \"Based on the environment that we know exists, which, as Democrats, we've been telling you for the last several months, is the reality, but now it's been confirmed by the American people.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHe also praised the passage of a California redistricting proposition, which was backed by Gov. Gavin Newsom, saying it will further help Democrats retake the House.\n\n\"Stay tuned because more is coming,\" he said. \"Republicans are going to be unable to gerrymander their way into rigging the midterm elections. That scheme is over. Buried dead in the ground. And so, we're going to take back control of the House and fight for every inch of territory.\"",

        "title": "Democrats are hopeful again. But unresolved questions remain about party's path forward",
        "description": "WASHINGTON (AP) -- For a day, at least, beleaguered Democrats are hopeful again. But just beneath the party's relief at securing its first big electoral wins since last November's drubbing lay unresolved questions about its direction heading into next year's midterm elections.\n\nThe Election Day romp of Republicans stretched from deep-blue New York and California to swing states Georgia, Pennsylvania and Virginia. There were signs that key voting groups, including young people, Black voters and Hispanics who shifted toward President Donald Trump's Republican Party just a year ago, may be shifting back. And Democratic leaders across the political spectrum coalesced behind a simple message focused on Trump's failure to address rising costs and everyday kitchen table issues.\n\nThe dominant performance sparked a new round of debate among the party's establishment-minded pragmatists and fiery progressives over which approach led to Tuesday's victories, and which path to take into the high-stakes 2026 midterm elections and beyond. The lessons Democrats learn from the victories will help determine the party's leading message and messengers next year -- when elections will decide the balance of power in Congress for the second half of Trump's term -- and potentially in the 2028 presidential race, which has already entered its earliest stages.\n\n\"Of course, there's a division within the Democratic Party. There's no secret,\" Sen. Bernie Sanders told reporters at a Capitol Hill press conference about the election results.\n\nSanders and his chief political strategist pointed to the success of New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, a democratic socialist, as a model for Democrats across the country. But Rep. Suzan Del Bene, who leads the House Democrats' midterm campaign strategy, avoided saying Mamdani's name when asked about his success.\n\nDel Bene instead cheered the moderate approach adopted by Democrats Abigail Spanberger and Mikie Sherrill in successful races for governor in Virginia and New Jersey as a more viable track for candidates outside of a Democratic stronghold like New York City.\n\n\"New York is bright blue ... and the path to the majority in the House is going to be through purple districts,\" she told The Associated Press. \"The people of Arizona, Iowa and Nebraska aren't focused on the mayor of New York.\"\n\nPennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, a likely Democratic presidential prospect who campaigned alongside Democrats in several states leading up to Tuesday's elections, noted the candidates hit on a common issue that resonated with voters, regardless of location.\n\n\"All of these candidates who won in these different states were focused on peoples' everyday needs,\" Shapiro said. \"And you saw voters in every one of those states and cities showing up to send a clear message to Donald Trump that they're rejecting his chaos.\"\n\nAmid Democrats' celebratory phone calls and news conferences, members of the party's different wings had some sharp critiques for each other.\n\nWhile Shapiro cheered the party's success during a Wednesday interview, he also acknowledged concerns about Mamdani in New York.\n\nShapiro, one of the nation's most prominent Jewish elected leaders, said he's not comfortable with some of Mamdani's comments on Israel. The New York mayor-elect, a Muslim, has described Israel's response to the Oct. 7 attacks as \"genocide\" against the Palestinian people and has been slow to condemn rhetoric linked to anti-Semitism.\n\n\"I've expressed that to him personally. We've had good private communications,\" Shapiro said of his concerns. \"And I hope, as he did last night in his victory speech, that he'll be a mayor that protects all New Yorkers and tries to bring people together.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Sanders' political strategist, Faiz Shakir, warned Democrats against embracing \"cookie cutter campaigns that say nothing and do nothing\" -- a reference to centrist Democrats Spanberger and Sherrill.\n\nMinneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, a Democrat who defeated democratic socialist Omar Fateh to win a third term, said at a news conference Wednesday that \"we have to love our city more than our ideology.\"\n\n\"We need to be doing everything possible to push back on authoritarianism and what Donald Trump is doing,\" Frey said. \"And at the same time, the opposite of Donald Trump extremism is not the opposite extreme.\"\n\nDespite potential cracks in the Democratic coalition, it's hard to understate the extent of the party's electoral success.\n\nIn Georgia, two Democrats cruised to wins over Republican incumbents in elections to the state Public Service Commission, delivering the largest statewide margins of victory by Democrats in more than 20 years.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, Democrats swept not only three state Supreme Court races, but every county seat in presidential swing counties like Bucks and Erie Counties, including sheriffs. Bucks County elected its first Democratic district attorney as Democrats there also won key school board races and county judgeships.\n\nMaine voters defeated a Republican-backed measure that would have mandated showing an ID at the polls. Colorado approved raising taxes on people earning more than $300,000 annually to fund school meal programs and food assistance for low-income state residents. And California voters overwhelmingly backed a charge led by Gov. Gavin Newsom to redraw its congressional map to give Democrats as many as five more House seats in upcoming elections.\n\nTrump made inroads with Black and Hispanic voters in 2024. But this week, Democrats scored strong performances with non-white voters in New Jersey and Virginia that offered promise.\n\nAbout 7 in 10 voters in New Jersey were white, according to the AP Voter Poll. And Sherrill won about half that group. But she made up for her relative weakness with whites with a strong showing among Black, Hispanic and Asian voters.\n\nThe vast majority -- about 9 in 10 -- of Black voters supported Sherrill, as did about 8 in 10 Asian voters.\n\nHispanic voters in New Jersey were more divided, but about two-thirds supported Sherrill; only about 3 in 10 voted for the Republican nominee, Jack Ciattarelli.\n\nThe pattern was similar in Virginia, where Spanberger performed well among Black voters, Hispanic voters and Asian voters, even though she didn't win a majority of white voters.\n\nThe debate over the party's future is already starting to play out in key midterm elections where Democrats have just begun intra-party primary contests.\n\nThe choice is stark in Maine's high-stakes Senate race, where Democrats will pick from a field that features establishment favorite, Gov. Jan Mills, and Sanders-endorsed populist Graham Platner. A similar dynamic could play out in key contests across Massachusetts, New York, Texas and Michigan.\n\nMichigan Democratic Senate candidate Abdul El-Sayed, who is aligned with the progressive wing of the party, said the people he speaks to are demanding bold action to address their economic concerns.\n\n\"Folks are so frustrated by how hard its become to afford a dignified life here in Michigan and across the country,\" he said.\n\n\"I'm sure the corporate donors don't want us to push too hard,\" El-Sayed continued. \"My worry is the very same people who told us we were just fine in 2024 will miss the mandate.\"",

        "title": "Gianni Infantino lauds President Trump, hints he may award him FIFA peace prize",
        "description": "President Donald J. Trump pumps his fist while exiting the stage during the American Business Forum at the Kaseya Center in Miami on Wednesday, Nov. 5, 2025. (Carl Juste/Miami Herald/Tribune News Service via Getty Images) Miami Herald\n\nFIFA President Gianni Infantino has once again hailed \"close friend\" President Trump, while also hinting that FIFA will award the U.S. political chief its inaugural \"Peace\" prize at the World Cup draw in Washington D.C. in December.\n\nIn a passionate defence of President Trump's performance since returning to the White House, Infantino also hailed him as a man who \"says what many people think\" and said he could not understand \"negative comments.\"\n\nInfantino was speaking at the America Business Forum in Miami on Wednesday, as part of a remarkable line-up which included Trump and Lionel Messi.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, FIFA announced the introduction of its \"FIFA Peace Prize - Football Unites the World.\" They said this would reward individuals who have taken exceptional and extraordinary actions for peace and those who have united people across the world.\n\nTrump has claimed to have ended eight wars since returning to power in January but was famously overlooked for the Nobel Peace Prize, which instead went to Maria Corina Macaho, a Venezuelan opposition figurehead who has opposed the regime of Nicolas Maduro. She spoke at the conference in Miami on Wednesday morning via videolink, a couple of hours before Trump's appearance.\n\nWhen FIFA announced the new award on Wednesday, they did not say who the recipient would be but the announcement corresponded with Infantino and Trump speaking at the same conference in Miami. The description FIFA provided also fits the framing of Trump that he and his allies wish the world to know, as well as the 'President of Peace' moniker he has bestowed upon himself.\n\nTrump's speech on Wednesday lunchtime marked a year since he won the Presidential election last November. His speech reeled off the achievements he says he has made, notably the release of Israeli hostages and a peace plan for Gaza, but also took aim at new and former rivals.\n\n\"This is the golden age of America,\" Trump began, before admonishing his predecessor \"crooked Joe Biden\", who he also described as \"Sleepy Joe.\"\n\nHe then moved onto another former U.S. president, Barack Obama, placing emphasis when saying Obama's middle name Hussein and describing him as a \"mean person and a divider.\"\n\nHe then referred to California governor Gavin Newsom as \"Gavin Newscum.\" He also criticized the newly-elected New York City mayor Zohran Mamdani, describing him as a communist - Mamdani describes himself as a democratic socialist - and said that Miami would be a \"refuge\" for those fleeing communism from New York.\n\nHe once again attacked the involvement of transgender athletes in women's sports, claiming that Mamdani \"or whatever the hell his name is\", takes a more liberal position on the matter.\n\nInfantino was among the audience at the Kaseya Center and he only appeared effusive during President Trump's speech. Infantino gave a thumbs up as Trump explained how he was only in his first term as leader when the United bid for Canada, Mexico and the United States secured the 2026 World Cup.\n\n\"So when they rigged the election,\" Trump alleged, repeating his disproven claim about his 2020 defeat to Biden. \"I said I have to run again because I want to be President when they have the World Cup.\" The cameras showed Infantino laughing along.\n\nTrump described Infantino as \"a big star.\" He added: \"The tickets are selling at numbers and records like never before. (Gianni) says they are doing record business.\"\n\nTrump did not stay for Infantino's speech later in the afternoon. That, however, did not see Infantino hold back during a fervent defense and endorsement of the U.S. president.\n\nInfantino said: \"We have a great relationship. I'm really lucky. I have a great relationship with President Trump, where I consider him a really close friend. Of course he's being very helpful in everything we are doing for the World Cup. He is really engaged. He has such incredible energy and this is something that I really admire.\n\n\"He does things. He does what he says. He says what he thinks. He actually says what many people think as well, but maybe don't dare to say and that's why he's so successful. I have to say it and I'm a bit surprised sometimes when we read some negative comments. I am not American, but as far as I understand, President Trump was elected in the United States of America and was quite clearly elected. When you are in such a great democracy as the United States of America, you should first of all respect the results of the election, right? In the end he was elected based on the programme, based on what he said. He is just implementing what he said he would do. So I think we should all support what he's doing because I think it's looking pretty good.\"\n\nInfantino went on to explain that the reason behind the new award, which will be awarded to a recipient at the Kennedy Center at the World Cup draw next month, Since returning as president, Trump has also taken over the Kennedy Center, installing himself as chair and filling a previously bi-partisan board with his allies. The Athletic has previously reported how FIFA had been in advanced conversations with venues to host the draw in Las Vegas, only for FIFA to follow the wishes of the Trump administration by instead plumping for the Kennedy Center. Trump is expected to be in attendance for the draw.\n\n\"Our motto in FIFA is that football or soccer unites and that it brings people together from the entire planet,\" Infantino said. \"When we see what is happening in our world today. which is a very divided world, we need to find more occasions to bring people together, because when these people come together, they speak to each other, they understand each other. We believe that peace in the world is something which is so important.\n\n\"We have to support it because it's about unity and we have to support anyone who is doing something special. So we thought we have to bring to life the FIFA Peace Prize. The first edition will be happening this year with the awarding of the 5th of December in Washington, D.C., on the occasion of the draw for the World Cup, because we will have a global audience with 1 billion people watching the draw. This is the right platform to award somebody who has done so much or is doing so much for peace, because we need that. Football helps a little bit, but then we need leaders who push it into the goal.\"",

        "title": "Two Republican Incumbents Will Face Off as Red Turf Shrinks in California",
        "description": "A day after California voters shrunk the number of safe Republican House seats through a Democratic gerrymander, two endangered incumbents said they would square off against each other in a high-stakes bid for political survival next year.\n\nRepresentative Ken Calvert, a Riverside County Republican whose 41st Congressional District was carved up and appended to several neighboring districts, said on Wednesday that he would run for the new incarnation of the 40th District, one of the few friendly territories left for Republicans in California.\n\nHe made no mention of the fact that the district was already occupied.\n\nRepresentative Young Kim, an Orange County Republican, is the current 40th District incumbent, and she said on Wednesday that she would not cede her favorable turf without a fight. The Democratic redraw of congressional maps actually made her district safer for Republicans than it was before -- which also made it an attractive life raft.\n\nThat means two veteran G.O.P. incumbents will vie for one House seat in a clash that underscores how dire the stakes have become for Republicans in California. It also shows how the redistricting war has sent incumbents scrambling in the middle of the decade, in a way that unlucky members usually only do after a new census.\n\n\"It's a game of musical chairs, and a bunch of chairs just got taken away from the game,\" said Rob Stutzman, a Republican strategist based in Sacramento. \"So they're going to be competing for what's left.\"\n\nIt is possible that other vulnerable Republicans could seek safer territory occupied by their colleagues rather than run in their redrawn districts. House candidates are not required to live in the districts they represent, as long as they live in the same state.\n\nPolitical strategists have speculated that Representative Kevin Kiley, a Sacramento-area Republican, could challenge Representative Tom McClintock, who holds a safe Republican seat that will now stretch across largely rural Sierra Nevada counties. If Mr. Kiley were to stay in his current district, he would have to face Representative Ami Bera, a Democrat from Sacramento who announced Wednesday that he would run for Mr. Kiley's redrawn seat.\n\nMr. Kiley said on Wednesday that he was not sure yet where he would run next year.\n\nNear the southern border, Representative Darrell Issa, a Republican who has an inland San Diego County district, is not far from the new 40th District that Mr. Calvert and Ms. Kim will fight over. Mr. Issa, who would be vulnerable if he stayed in his current district, wrote on Tuesday that he was \"not going anywhere,\" without specifying where he would run.\n\nMr. Calvert on Wednesday suggested that he actually had the closest ties to the newly configured 40th District, which includes the easternmost parts of Orange County and the westernmost parts of Riverside County. Mr. Calvert lives in the city of Corona, a spokesman for his campaign said, which is in the new district.\n\nHis campaign had data at the ready showing that just over 50 percent of voters in the district were part of his old 41st District in Riverside, compared with 32 percent in Ms. Kim's former district and 15 percent in the old district of Mr. Issa.\n\n\"No one else comes close to my record of service to the new 40th,\" Mr. Calvert said in a statement, without mentioning Ms. Kim by name. \"I've lived here my entire life and already represent the majority of this district in Congress.\"\n\nMs. Kim made clear in her own statement on Wednesday that she was running for re-election and, in a sign she was prepared to fight, said she was booking a multimillion-dollar ad buy that would start in April. Like Mr. Calvert, she did not mention her opponent in her statement and kept the focus on blasting the redistricting ballot measure, Proposition 50, which was crafted by Gov. Gavin Newsom and other state Democrats.\n\n\"These failed career politicians made partisan deals behind closed doors to redraw districts in ways that help themselves and their allies instead of the voters,\" she wrote.\n\nMr. Calvert, who has served in the House since 1993, has long been a top target for Democrats, but survived countless challenges. Ms. Kim, a third-term congresswoman who lives in Anaheim, within the new 40th District, is also battle-tested. After narrowly losing her first bid for a House seat in 2018 to Representative Gil Cisneros, a Democrat, she ousted him two years later in another close race. (Mr. Cisneros returned to the House this year after winning a different district.)\n\nShe has been a target for Democrats ever since, but the new congressional map likely put the reconfigured 40th District out of reach for the party. Democrats removed conservative areas from the districts they had hoped to flip, then added them to the 40th District to concentrate Republican votes there.\n\nThat has not dissuaded Democratic candidates from running for the district; among the entrants are Christina Gagnier, a school district member; Joe Kerr, a retired firefighter; Lisa Ramirez, an immigration lawyer; and Esther Kim Varet, a prominent art dealer.\n\nMs. Ramirez and Ms. Kim Varet both said on Wednesday that they planned to stay in the race. Ms. Kim Varet said that although it would be an uphill battle, she thought Mr. Calvert and Ms. Kim might hurt each other enough to help her own campaign.\n\n\"These two people that are bloodying themselves up, they're old,\" said Ms. Kim Varet, who has raised $2 million. \"I'm a millennial -- they're part of the old guard. There is a reckoning coming of old politicians, and old Trump politicians makes it even worse.\"\n\nMr. Stutzman suggested that it was not all doom-and-gloom for Republicans. Several of the newly competitive districts could still go for his party, he said, and he argued that Republicans had a shot at flipping the Central Valley seat held by Representative Adam Gray, a Democrat who got a boost from the new map.\n\n\"They're not going to hang heads,\" he said. \"They're going to go fight for what's left.\"",

        "description": "California Governor Gavin Newsom speaks after he and other lawmakers signed the \"Election Rigging Response Act\" in Sacramento, California, U.S., August 21, 2025. REUTERS/Fred Greaves\n\nThis week, Californians voted overwhelmingly for Prop 50, which replaces the Golden State's current U.S. House of Representatives district map with a new one designed to give Democrats an edge in five Republican districts. The California Republican Party (CAGOP) is now suing to stop the new maps from taking effect, but California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) is doubting that the suit will succeed.\n\nAccording to Politico, the CAGOP sued in U.S. District Court in the Central District of California, claiming the new maps Prop 50 puts in place violate the 14th and 15th Amendments to the U.S. Constitution on the basis of race, \"without cause or basis to justify it.\" The 14th Amendment contains the Equal Protection Clause, which requires states to provide fair legal treatment to all citizens. The 15th Amendment prohibits states from denying citizens the right to vote (which was ratified after the Civil War).\n\n\"While the Constitution entrusts States with designing congressional districts, the Supreme Court has also held that states may not, without a compelling reason backed by evidence that was in fact considered, separate citizens into different voting districts on the basis of race,\" the complaint read.\n\nAfter Prop 50 passed, Steve Bannon -- who was President Donald Trump's chief White House strategist during his first term -- urged the Trump administration to have Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon (who oversees the Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division) sue California and win a temporary restraining order, and preventing Prop 50's new maps from going into effect through litigation. However, California Democratic Party leaders remain confident that Prop 50 will survive any court challenges.\n\nOn Wednesday, KCRA News political director Ashley Zavala reported that Gov. Newsom's office issued a statement in response to the CAGOP's lawsuit -- and included a taunt against both Republicans and Dhillon.\n\n\"We haven't reviewed the lawsuit, but if it's from the California Republican Party and Harmeet Dhillon's law firm, it's going to fail,\" stated Newsom spokesperson Brandon Richards. \"Good luck, losers.\"",

        "title": "Republicans break taboo on AI campaign ads",
        "description": "Republicans break taboo on AI campaign ads\n\nDeepfake of Schumer celebrating shutdown had huge impact\n\nArtificial intelligence is making its debut in political commercials with a National Republican Senatorial Committee ad featuring a deepfake video. In it, Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer, New York Democrat, is shown speaking words from a print interview about the government shutdown, an innovation that changes campaigns forever.\n\nThe ad was posted Oct. 17 on the Senate Republican X account. \"Week 3 of the Schumer Shutdown,\" the text states, followed by a quote Mr. Schumer gave to Punchbowl News last month. \"Every day,\" the New York Democrat said, \"gets better for us.\"\n\nIn the lower right-hand corner of the commercial, under the NRSC logo, is a box reading \"AI Generated.\" The gray transparency is easy to miss because the viewer's attention is, by design, fixed on Mr. Schumer. More than 1.8 million people have watched the 30-second spot on X alone.\n\nThe commercial begins with the deepfake of Mr. Schumer. \"Chuck Schumer,\" a narrator says, \"thinks playing with Americans' livelihoods is just a game. When asked about the government shutdown, Schumer said ...\" and the altered clip repeats as a wide, Cheshire Cat grin spreads across the senator's face.\n\n\"Really, Chuck?\" the narrator asks. \"How's that?\" The ad cuts to clips outlining the shutdown's costs, including stress on military families, \"control towers shutting down\" at airports and \"critical food assistance\" lapsing \"for low-income women, infants and children.\" After a remark that \"the pain is going to increase on the American people,\" Sen. Ted Cruz, Texas Republican, says it's \"because [the Democrats] want free, government-provided health care for illegal aliens.\" The ad concludes with the narrator saying, \"The Schumer Shutdown is making things worse across America, and Democrats love it.\"\n\nA traditional ad would have driven home the point by reading Mr. Schumer's quote, but the AI-generated video has far greater impact.\n\nMr. Schumer explained to Punchbowl that Democrats \"knew that health care would be the focal point\" of the shutdown and \"prepared for it.\" He predicted that Republicans thought they would \"threaten us, bamboozle us, and we would submit in a day or two.\" It was here where Mr. Schumer said that \"every day gets better for us\" and \"every time\" Republicans \"try something, it doesn't quite work.\" The Republican Party has since failed to peel off enough Democratic senators to reach the 60-vote threshold required to break their filibuster.\n\nThe quote used in the ad illustrates Mr. Schumer's strategy even without the added context, and short quotes or quotes broken up by ellipses are standard political fare. Some have been used to create false impressions of their own, such as an infamous AFL-CIO \"Medi-scare\" commercial used against Speaker Newt Gingrich in 1995.\n\nThe 1995 commercial featured a senior citizen praising Medicare. It then cut to Mr. Gingrich saying that Republicans wouldn't \"get rid of it in round one\" but believed \"it's going to wither on the vine because we think people are voluntarily going to leave it.\" Mr. Gingrich's full remarks show that \"it\" didn't refer to Medicare but to the Health Care Financing Administration, which oversees the program. Judging that the bureaucracy was inefficient based on complaints, Republicans felt they could offer a better alternative.\n\nAI allows the creation of ads that are even more deceptive. Politicians can be shown saying anything with visual details that add subtext. These can be facial cues, such as Mr. Schumer's grin, or unkempt attire, bloodshot eyes and a sweaty upper lip. The only limit is the creator's imagination.\n\nLegislation to regulate manipulated ads has run afoul of the First Amendment. In July, California Gov. Gavin Newsom said an altered video on X featuring Vice President Kamala Harris ought to be \"illegal.\" Mr. Newsom signed the Defending Democracy From Deepfake Deception Act, but a federal judge voided it. The governor has since leaned into AI, posting an image of MAGA singer Kid Rock appearing to offer an endorsement.\n\nAbsent regulations that pass constitutional muster, deepfakes in political commercials are here to stay now that Senate Republicans have broken the taboo. Citizens are advised to be on guard, because although Mr. Schumer's position on the shutdown may not get better every day, AI technology does.",

        "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Ultimate Fighting Championship pioneer and legend Royce Gracie has endorsed a pro-law enforcement candidate who is running for governor in California.\n\nOne of the biggest names in mixed martial arts and the first UFC champion, Gracie made a name for himself by taking down much larger opponents through precision and skill.\n\nNow he is weighing into the political sphere in the race to replace Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, who is term-limited and widely rumored to have 2028 presidential ambitions.\n\nIn a statement to Fox News Digital, Gracie said he is endorsing sheriff Chad Bianco's long-shot bid to replace Newsom in 2026. Gracie, a three-time UFC champion, called Bianco a \"fighter\" who is \"exactly who we need.\"\n\nKATIE PORTER SAYS SHE REGRETS VIRAL OUTBURSTS AT REPORTER, STAFFER\n\n\"When Gavin Newsom closed businesses, schools, and churches, one person stood against him, Sheriff Chad Bianco,\" Gracie told Fox News Digital.\n\n\"Chad Bianco didn't fold. He's a fighter, and a fighter is exactly who we need as Governor of California,\" he added, saying, \"We need his strength to turn this state around after the mess Gavin Newsom has created.\"\n\nBianco, who is a vocal Trump supporter and the sheriff of Riverside County, just east of Los Angeles, announced his gubernatorial candidacy back in February, saying, \"Californians deserve better.\"\n\nHe has framed his candidacy around restoring safety and a better quality of life to California.\n\n\"This campaign will not be about the divide between Republicans and Democrats. It will be about the common goal we all have for a better California,\" Bianco emphasized at his campaign launch.\n\n\"As Californians, we want leadership that actually cares about the cost of living ...and leaders who will do something about it,\" Bianco said in his address. \"We want homes we can afford. We want air conditioning when it's hot, not rolling blackouts. We want water for the crops and animals that feed us. We want the opportunity to achieve the California Dream, not be prevented from it because of red tape and regulation from government. We want honesty and transparency from our elected officials. We want lower taxes and less government waste. We want sanity restored and common sense to prevail.\"\n\nPELOSI SPOKESMAN SIDESTEPS RETIREMENT RUMORS AS DEM PRIMARY THREATS WAIT IN WINGS\n\nBianco, who has worked in law enforcement for more than three decades, was first elected sheriff in 2018. A vocal critic of Newsom and soft on crime policies, Bianco was one of the leaders who helped push California's Proposition 36 ballot measure to a landslide victory in last November's elections. The measure, which took effect in December, mandates stiffer penalties and longer sentences in California for certain drug and theft crimes.\n\nIn response to Gracie's endorsement, Bianco told Fox News Digital that \"Californians are waking up, and we are going to clean up this state.\"\n\n\"Gavin Newsom has been chasing away Californians in record numbers,\" he said, adding, \"I'm grateful for the support of patriots like Royce Gracie.\"\n\nFox News Digital reached out to Newsom's office for comment but did not receive a statement by the time of publication.\n\nBianco is facing a steep uphill battle to win as a Republican in deep blue California. It has been nearly two decades since a Republican won a statewide race.\n\nThough still early, the current frontrunner to be Newsom's successor is former Democratic Rep. Katie Porter, a progressive who has made resisting President Donald Trump a central theme of her campaign.\n\nCALIFORNIA FIREFIGHTERS TOLD TO IGNORE SIGNS OF A FIRE: REPORT\n\nXavier Becerra, former U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary under the Biden administration and former California attorney general, is also running for the Democratic nomination.\n\nCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe Democratic and Republican primaries will be held on June 2 next year and the general election will be on Nov. 3.",

        "description": "Austin Turner is a web producer at CBS News Los Angeles. An Inland Empire native, Austin earned a degree in journalism from San Jose State University in 2020. Before joining CBS News in 2025, he worked at KTLA, the San Jose Mercury News, the Sedona Red Rock News and various other outlets as a freelance sports reporter.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom's Proposition 50 initiative will knock at least one prominent California Republican out of Congress, as two of them each announced their candidacies for the new 40th congressional district on Wednesday.\n\nRep. Ken Calvert, a congressional mainstay for more than 30 years, announced Wednesday will attempt to remain in Congress with a run in the newly drawn 40th Congressional District. Hours later, Rep. Young Kim said she'll run for re-election in the same district, setting up a showdown between the two Republicans in the 2026 midterm elections.\n\nThe announcements come on the heels of the projected passage of Proposition 50, the off-cycle redistricting initiative spearheaded by Gov. Gavin Newsom. A CBS News projection on Wednesday afternoon showed that 63.8% of voters backed the proposition.\n\nThe new 40th congressional district will effectively split Corona in half and span from the easternmost cities of Orange County, like Villa Park and Mission Viejo, across the Inland Empire to Murrieta and Menifee.\n\nCalvert, a vocal critic of the initiative, currently represents California's 41st congressional district. The district currently covers parts of the Inland Empire, but will be redrawn to span parts of western Orange County and southeast Los Angeles County.\n\nThe Corona native now seeks to remain in the House of Representatives, where he has been in office since 1992.\n\n\"The newly drawn 40th District is where I was born and raised,\" Calvert said in a statement. \"I've had the honor of serving the overwhelming majority of these communities and delivering results for both Riverside and Orange Counties.\"\n\nCalvert will potentially face a reality he hasn't dealt with much in his 30-plus years in Congress -- a competitive electoral challenge.\n\nKim, of Anaheim Hills, has represented the 40th congressional district since 2023. The 63-year-old immigrated from South Korea as a teenager, and like Calvert, is a staunch supporter of President Trump.\n\n\"I am running for re-election in California's 40th district. Gavin Newsom and Democrats in Sacramento made partisan deals behind closed doors to redraw districts in ways that benefit themselves and their allies, not voters,\" Kim said. \"I'm running because it is clear we need an America First champion to take the fight to the radical Democrats and help President Trump unleash the Golden Age.\"\n\nIt's not yet clear if anyone else, including any Democrats, will enter the race.",

        "description": "Voters in former Republican strongholds are seeing red as their districts turn blue after Gavin Newsom and California's voters passed Prop 50, paving the way to flip five House seats to the Democrats.\n\nThe proposition -- which passed overwhelming with 63 percent of the vote -- was a feat of calculated gerrymandering meant to offset a similar, Trump-backed scheme in Texas, theoretically balancing the scales in Washington.\n\nProp 50 eliminates five of the state's Republican congressional districts by swapping the existing map -- drawn by an independent commission -- with one from Democratic state lawmakers until 2030.\n\nBut 2,000 miles away from the Capitol, conservative Californians feel their voice is being stripped away in the name of political gamesmanship.\n\n\"This is just Newsom reacting to Texas. He says, 'They can do it, and we can do it too.' It's like a child throwing a tantrum,\" said Silvia Garcia, 73, who cast a \"no\" vote in her hometown of Lakeside, CA, near San Diego.\n\nLakeside, a Republican enclave, will now be part of a majority-Democrat district for the next five years.\n\nTexas recently took on a gerrymandering plan of its own, hatched at the request of President Trump, who browbeat state lawmakers into drumming up five more seats for the Republicans ahead of the midterms.\n\nLigia Carle, 64, who moved to the U.S. from Mexico City more than 30 years ago, doesn't mind fighting chicanery with chicanery.\n\n\"It's not unfair. They started this. [Trump] is the one who requested an extra five seats,\" she said.\n\n\"It is very disappointing that things can be so crooked. I never expected something like this,\" Carle admitted, but said she hopes Prop 50 will help stymie \"everything that is happening right now, the bad things happening around the country. ICE taking down citizens. I hope it will stop.\"\n\nBut Amy Liebland, 65, a conservative in the town of Huntington Beach, near Los Angeles, believes \"two wrongs don't make a right.\"\n\n\"I'm against it on principle,\" she told The Post.\n\nDiane Adams, 73, from the same town, laments the suspension of the Citizens Redistricting Commission (CRC), an independent body established in 2010 tasked with drawing more equitable district maps.\n\n\"The independent decision-making group we already have should stay in place,\" Adams told The Post.\n\nLarry Shriver, a retiree in the tiny, apple-growing town of Julian, put it more bluntly:\n\n\"Those motherf -- s! I voted not only 'no' but 'hell no!'\" he told The Post.\n\nRobin Kelly, a tax consultant in Riverside, doesn't trust the politicians behind Prop 50 to set things right after 2030.\n\n\"If people think they're are going to allow us to have [the old map] back, they're not...Once we allow gerrymandering, they will never give that up again. They'll always find a way,\" she said.\n\nThat Prop 50 was an act of gerrymandering was never in question.\n\nThe text of the ballot itself described Prop 50 as \"temporary changes to congressional district maps in response to Texas' partisan redistricting.\"\n\nGovernor Newsom even called it \"the most transparent and democratic redistricting that's ever been done in the United States of America.\"\n\nState Republicans disagree, and they are already taking Prop 50 to court.\n\nThe California Republican Party filed a federal lawsuit Tuesday challenging the state's new congressional district maps, alleging Democrats illegally used race as the primary factor in redrawing boundaries to favor Latino voters.\n\nThe complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, seeks to invalidate the new map.",

REUTERS/Jay Paul TPX IMAGES OF THE DAY REFILE - QUALITY REPEAT\n\nA reported battle brewing between Maryland Democrats and the party in the rest of the country spilled out into the open on Wednesday, following the Democratic Party's resounding victory in state and local elections across the nation the previous night.\n\nThe controversy unfurled on X, where Virginia state Senate President Pro Tempore L. Louise Lucas, a Democrat known for her confrontational style, lashed out at Maryland's Democratic Senate President, Bill Ferguson over the topic of redistricting.\n\n\"Tonight's resounding Democratic victory shows we don't need to rig the system to win,\" Ferguson posted. \"When we provide a better vision about the future -- lower costs, better services, and real solutions to protect against Trump -- voters overwhelmingly choose our leadership.\"\n\nLucas, however, was having none of it.\n\n\"Get our victory in Virginia out of your mouth while you echo MAGA talking points,\" wrote Lucas in a reply. \"Grow a pair and stand up to this President. This is just embarassing.\"\n\nAs Republicans in states like Texas, Missouri, and North Carolina have heeded President Donald Trump's demand to redraw their congressional maps to rig extra House seats for themselves, Democrats in some states have fought back. California voters passed Gavin Newsom's Proposition 50 Tuesday to temporarily suspend the state's independent commission and draw a 5-seat gerrymander to offset Texas, and Virginia Democrats are now discussing a constitutional amendment that would do the same.\n\nIn Maryland, however, Democrats in the legislature have resisted calls to draw out their one remaining Republican seat, despite House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) personally leaning on them, and despite Maryland Gov. Wes Moore pushing for a special legislative session on the matter.\n\nFerguson has argued that a mid-decade redistricting in Maryland is \"too risky,\" because the state is already heavily gerrymandered in Democrats' favor and a state court struck down their previous attempt at a more favorable map. His worry is that another redraw could set up a case that strikes down not just any redrawn map, but their current map, costing them seats.\n\nHe has additionally argued that redrawing Maryland's map could dilute the power of Black voters, although according to political analyst David Nir of The Downballot, \"The exact opposite is true: Maryland Democrats could easily increase the number of majority-Black districts from two to three.\"",

Gavin Newsom, is designed to help Democrats flip as many as five congressional House seats in the midterm elections next year. The lawsuit claims the map-makers illegally used race as a factor to favor Hispanic voters, and asks the court to block the new boundaries ahead of the 2026 elections. The complaint was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed by The Dhillon Law Group, the California-based firm started by Harmeet Dhillon, who is now an assistant attorney general for civil rights at the U.S. Department of Justice.\n\n\"The map is designed to favor one race of California voters over others,\" Mike Columbo, whose plaintiffs include a state Republican lawmaker and 18 other voters, said at a news conference Wednesday. \"This violates the 14th Amendment, guarantee of equal protection under the law, and the right under the 15th Amendment.\"\n\nNewsom's office said on a social media post that the state hasn't reviewed the lawsuit but is confident the challenge will fail.\n\n\"Good luck, losers,\" the post reads.\n\nIt's unclear whether a three-judge panel convened to hear such cases would grant a temporary restraining order before December 19, the date when candidates can start collecting voters' signatures to lower the costs of their filing fee. It's essentially the first step in officially running in the 2026 midterm elections. Columbo said he's hoping to get a decision in the upcoming weeks.\n\nRepublicans have filed multiple lawsuits in California to block Democrats' plan with little success so far.",

        "title": "What the Democrats' Good Night Means for 2026 and Beyond",
        "description": "Election Night 2025 was a good one for Democrats. On Tuesday, the Party recaptured the governorship in Virginia, with the victory of the former congresswoman Abigail Spanberger over the Republican Lieutenant Governor Winsome Earle-Sears, and held the governorship in New Jersey, with the congresswoman Mikie Sherrill's defeat of Jack Ciattarelli. Both victories had been expected, as was Zohran Mamdani's defeat of Andrew Cuomo in the New York mayoral election. (Spanberger and Sherrill won by approximately fifteen and thirteen percentage points, respectively; Mamdani appears on track for a high single-digit win.) Democrats also did well lower down the ballot in a number of Virginia races, in state races in Pennsylvania and Georgia, and notably in California, where the redistricting referendum led by Gavin Newsom -- a response to Texas's Republican-led effort to create five new G.O.P. House seats -- passed overwhelmingly.\n\nTo talk about the election results, and what they portend for next year's House and Senate races, I spoke by phone with Sean Trende, the senior elections analyst at RealClearPolitics and a visiting scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. During our conversation, which has been edited for length and clarity, we discussed why Democrats managed to outperform expectations, the trouble Republicans face without Donald Trump on the ballot, and what the results mean for 2026 and 2028.\n\nWhat's your biggest takeaway from Tuesday's results?\n\nIt's a bad night to be a Republican. It's hard to see what the silver lining is when you have losses all over the place.\n\nIn the past nine months or so, a lot of people have been saying that the Democratic Party's brand is in the toilet. Democrats are not popular. They seem disliked by much of the country, including a big chunk of their own voters. This is not a good place to be if you're a Democrat. How much does this really matter if you are the opposition party? How did you see that question before tonight, and do you see it any differently now?\n\nI have a long-standing belief that elections are referenda on the party in power. My first reaction when I started hearing the argument that Democrats were in trouble was that I had heard the exact same argument in 2010. You may recall that Obama had an entire post-financial crisis spiel about how the Republicans had driven the car into the ditch and now the Democrats were trying to help it out. It went on for quite some time, but voters didn't care. They didn't like Republicans, but they didn't like what Democrats were doing, either. [Republicans had huge success in the 2010 midterms.] And I think it's the same story today, with the parties flipped. People's dislike of some things that Democrats believe and do might be a problem for governing when Democrats win, but I don't think it's a problem for elections.\n\nTrump is not that popular, but he does bring certain benefits to Republicans when he is on the ballot, especially in terms of turnout. In most elections during the Trump era when he has not been on the ballot, Democrats have done well. Broadly speaking, Republicans seem to do quite poorly when he is not on the ballot.\n\nYeah, we saw a similar thing with Obama. He was a political force and could turn out all kinds of voters in Presidential elections, but the Democrats would get walloped in the off-year elections. And I think Trump has a similar effect. There are a lot of true Trump voters out there who just aren't going to show up in the off-year elections. And, meanwhile, Republicans have kind of traded away their big advantage, which was upper-class suburbanites who vote during the off years. Now those people are mostly Democrats.\n\nWhen I grew up and was following politics, people often talked about the desire of voters to keep a check on the party in power. So, if you had Republicans in power, you would want to vote for Democrats, and the President's party would often lose midterm elections. That still seems true, but now the story seems to be about there being different electorates in off-year elections. Has there been a change of some sort?\n\nI think that, as we've become more polarized and there are fewer swing voters, it's become more about who is voting. It's less of a persuasion game and more of just a simple turnout game. That's the beginning and end of it. We are in a highly polarized environment where there just aren't that many marginal voters, and you don't really see the types of swings that you would have seen from, say, 1964 to 1980. It's just harder and harder to persuade people. It's about getting your voters to the polls, and that's not a good bargain for Republicans right now.\n\nThe theory of politics you have just described -- that it's more about motivating people than persuasion -- is normally viewed more sympathetically by more ideological party members, and less so by centrists. Democrats have been engaging in this debate about whether they need to fire up their own voters or reach out to voters in the center. As someone who's followed your work closely, I would not think of you as someone who has the perspective that parties just need to fire up their own voters. Have you changed your opinion?\n\nGenerally speaking, Americans still don't like radical change. They don't like tariffs being sprung on them willy-nilly. They don't like some of the things that Democrats in power do. So where moderation, I think, can help is when you're actually governing. That distinction is what we were talking about a little bit at the beginning -- about how it doesn't matter that you're unpopular when you're out of power, but, when it comes to governing and we start talking about the, like, seven or eight per cent that's persuadable, it could be a problem.\n\nOn Tuesday, two gubernatorial candidates, in Virginia and New Jersey, who are considered more moderate did quite well, and outperformed the polls. In Virginia, they did better than Democrats had done in 2017, during Trump's first term. And in New Jersey they maybe did a little bit worse, but, at the same time, New Jersey has come much closer to being a purple state in the past decade, or at least it was in the last election. So, do people who are making the case that moderation is crucial for Democrats to win have an argument about these two races?\n\nYeah, and I think you summed up the argument there. If you're looking for a counter on that, it would be the Virginia attorney general's race, right? That's where you had, I think, a pretty radical sounding Democratic candidate. Maybe people rationalized it away, but he ended up running only four points behind Spanberger. And over all, he will win by about six points, and Spanberger will have won by about fifteen. So I think that actually gives you a pretty good insight into what the universe of persuadable voters was. Twenty years ago in Virginia, a guy who got caught texting the things that the soon-to-be attorney general did would have run much worse. [Jay Jones, the Democrat, fantasized in text messages about shooting a Republican colleague.] So that's the polarization and the limit on how much radicalism can hurt you in a general election right there.",

        "title": "Gavin Newsom's crude Prop 50 chest-thumping isn't the win he thinks...",
        "description": "California Gov. Gavin Newsom blew a big chance Tuesday night to share a vision for America with a national audience.\n\nInstead, the Democrat made his victory speech all about President Donald Trump.\n\nIn a way, that was no surprise: Newsom had campaigned for Proposition 50 -- which sets aside California's independent congressional map in favor of raw, partisan gerrymandering -- as if it were a referendum on Trump, and not about California at all.\n\nAs of Wednesday morning, Prop 50 had won nearly two-thirds of the vote, a sign of the intensity of partisan loyalty among Democrats in the state -- and of California Republicans' despair.\n\nLocal GOP partisans gave up the fight long before Election Day.\n\nEven Rick Caruso, the Republican-turned-Democrat developer who saved his mall from the Palisades Fire by defying incompetent local authorities, felt obliged to support Prop 50 to remain politically viable.\n\nCaruso had to know the ballot measure was bad -- but he funded mailers that promoted it, alongside his photo.\n\nHis best argument for gerrymandering was that without it, California would \"unfairly lose power in DC\" -- an odd claim, since Democrats are already in the minority in the US House.\n\nCaruso also claimed that Prop 50 \"protected our rights in Congress,\" when it actually disenfranchised millions of Californians.\n\nAnd after all that, Newsom didn't bother to thank him in his speech.\n\nVictory presents the opportunity to show magnanimity -- to reach out to opponents and appeal to the common good.\n\nNewsom was having none of that.\n\nInstead, he continued his shrill attacks on the president, sketching a conspiracy theory in which Trump intends to use federal law enforcement and National Guard volunteers -- most of whom lead ordinary civilian lives -- to intimidate voters, seize power and \"rig\" the 2026 midterm elections in favor of Republicans.\n\nIronically, Newsom dangled the specter of Trump \"rigging\" the midterms while complaining that the president had accused him of \"rigging\" this year.\n\nThere is no evidence of fraud, yet Newsom and his party benefited from $282.6 million to run a special election whose only purpose was to boost Democrats' chances of retaking the House -- and to help Newsom set himself up as the party leader ahead of a likely 2028 presidential bid.\n\nNewsom also claimed that Trump intended to quash freedom of speech by sending federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to public gatherings.\n\nYet the California governor has one of the worst records on free speech of anyone in active politics.\n\nLast month, a federal judge threw out Newsom's law banning \"deepfake\" parodies of political candidates, just as the Supreme Court ended his attempts to restrict religious worship during the pandemic.\n\nIn his address to a national audience from Sacramento, Newsom said that Prop 50 was the first step toward the \"de facto\" end of the Trump presidency.\n\nIf Democrats win the House in 2026, he explained, Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) would become speaker, and would wield his power to stop Trump from governing.\n\nNot to advance Democrats' own agenda, but simply to overturn the 2024 election, in which Trump won the popular vote.\n\nNewsom has been cagey about whether he would support Trump's impeachment or not; he's said that he just wants \"oversight\" of the administration.\n\nRecent history suggests that Democrats would be unable to resist the temptation to repeat what they have already tried twice before.\n\nIn making so direct a threat to Trump, Newsom has ended any possibility of cooperation -- this, while California is still asking the federal government for $40 billion in fire aid.\n\nThe governor has to know that he is sacrificing the welfare of his state for his own political ambitions.\n\nHe is taking a calculated risk: That Democratic Party primary voters will care more about how hard a candidate fought against Trump than about how well he or she governed, when given the opportunity.\n\nPerhaps that is Newsom's best strategy.\n\nAfter two terms in office, he has almost no accomplishments, and he wasted no time trying to cite any Tuesday night.\n\nStill, Newsom could have chosen a less hysterical, more constructive tone.\n\nHe could have struck a contrast with New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, who quoted radicals and took potshots at his rivals in his own, strikingly bitter, victory speech.\n\nThe California governor failed to rise to the occasion as he made his bid for party leadership.\n\nIn the glare of a national spotlight, Newsom may have dimmed his own prospects.",

        "title": "'And so it begins!' Trump reacts to election results where Democrats swept races",
        "description": "Democrats swept in the Nov. 4 elections, with wins in the New York mayoral race and the gubernatorial races in Virginia and New Jersey.\n\nIn the Dems' wins, voters seemed to rebuke President Donald Trump in the first ballot box judgment of his return to power. Trump acknowledged Republicans underperformed, and some conservatives also pointed out the races were in blue states that Trump lost in 2024.\n\n\"'TRUMP WASN'T ON THE BALLOT, AND SHUTDOWN, WERE THE TWO REASONS THAT REPUBLICANS LOST ELECTIONS TONIGHT,' according to Pollsters,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social, but he did not cite the pollsters.\n\nOn Nov. 5, the government shutdown became the longest in American history, surpassing the last one that stretched 35 days in 2019, under Trump's first administration.\n\nHow else did Trump react to Tuesday's election results?\n\nHas Donald Trump posted about Zohran Mamdani's win?\n\nTrump had not yet posted any statement specifically about Mamdani's win as of the morning of Nov. 5.\n\nTrump had endorsed Andrew Cuomo, the former New York governor and longtime Democrat who lost in the primary and ran as an independent. But on Tuesday, New Yorkers chose 34-year-old Zohran Mamdani, whose campaign mobilized record-breaking volunteer and voter turnout.\n\n\"I'm not a fan of Cuomo one way or the other,\" Trump said on \"60 Minutes\" the weekend before the election. \"But if it's gonna be between a bad Democrat and a communist, I'm gonna pick the bad Democrat all the time to be honest with you.\"\n\nMamdani is not a communist but a democratic socialist. Communist societies are not democratic, while democratic socialism exists in European democracies like Norway, Sweden and Denmark.\n\nTrump formally endorsed Cuomo in a later Truth Social post and alluded to withholding federal funds to New York if Mamdani won. White House Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought has already announced $18 billion in infrastructure funds for New York had been put on hold amid the shutdown.\n\n\"Any Jewish person that votes for Zohran Mamdani, a proven and self-professed JEW HATER, is a stupid person!!!\" Trump also posted on Truth Social the day of the election.\n\nTrump on California win in state redistricting battle, Prop 50\n\nIn California, voters opted to pass Proposition 50, an effort from Gov. Gavin Newsom to counter Texas' new congressional map aimed at helping Republicans win as many as five more seats in the 2026 midterms. Initial results show the ballot measure passed by a wide margin, and could allow the state to create five new Democratic seats in the 2026 midterms.\n\n\"The Unconstitutional Redistricting Vote in California is a GIANT SCAM in that the entire process, in particular the Voting itself, is RIGGED. All 'Mail-In' Ballots, where the Republicans in that State are 'Shut Out,' is under very serious legal and criminal review. STAY TUNED!\" Trump said on Truth Social on Nov. 4 as voters were heading to the polls.\n\nAt least a dozen states are also moving to change their Congressional boundary lines ahead of the midterms.\n\nTrump did not mention the state battle in his Truth Social posts since the results came out.\n\nWhat other reaction did Trump share about election night?\n\nIn addition to his Truth Social posts, Trump addressed the election results at a White House breakfast with Republican Senators.\n\n\"Last night it was not expected to be a victory, it was very Democrat areas, but I don't think it was good for Republicans,\" Trump said at a breakfast with Republican Senators. \"I'm not sure it was good for anybody. ... We learned a lot.\"\n\nHe said they would talk more about what the loss represented and how it relates to the shutdown.\n\nIn another post on Truth Social posted late Tuesday after several races had been called, Trump said \"...AND SO IT BEGINS!\"\n\nThe White House did not immediately provide an explanation on what he meant by that.\n\nContributing: Phillip M.

        "description": "Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.\n\nThe Los Angeles Dodgers are set to visit the White House once again after winning their second straight World Series title.\n\nThe Dodgers became the first team to win back-to-back Fall Classics since the New York Yankees won three straight from 1998 to 2000 after completing a Game 7 comeback against the Toronto Blue Jays in 11 innings.\n\nThe team took a trip to 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. back in April during a series against the Washington Nationals, and if that's the plan again, the Dodgers would head back over sometime between April 3-5 next year.\n\nBut an immigration rights group is pleading with the team to not go.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM\n\n\"The Los Angeles Dodgers have always been more than a baseball team -- they're part of the spirit of who we are as a city. The team represents our neighborhoods, our families, and our shared love for our diverse communities. But right now, our community, our city are under siege, we need them to stand with us, on the right side of history,\" the National Day Laborer Organizing Network (NDLON) wrote in an online petition.\n\n\"Ask the team to honor the unity, integrity and diversity they themselves represent. They cannot stay silent as our families and neighbors face violence, detention, and deportation. By visiting a president who has used his power to harm the most vulnerable, the team would be turning its back on the very people who fill the stadiums, wear the jerseys, and give this team its heart. By encouraging the team to do the right thing, we will show the White House that Los Angeles stands for compassion, dignity, and solidarity with their immigrant neighbors.\"\n\n\"Los Angeles is a city built by immigrants, working families, and dreamers. We celebrate our champions, but we also stand for justice, dignity, and love for our community. Dodgers, stay with us. Stand with the city that has always stood with you,\" they said in an Instagram post, via ABC7 in Los Angeles.\n\nHard-throwing reliever Brusdar Graterol, along with some others, missed out on the celebration earlier this year. Graterol opted to stay at \"my brown house.\"\n\nOutfielder Mookie Betts decided to go this year after opting out of his trip with the Boston Red Sox in 2019.\n\nBRAVES HIRE LONGTIME BENCH COACH WALT WEISS AS NEW MANAGER\n\n\"This is not about me; I don't want anything to be about me. This is about the Dodgers. Because these boys were there for me,\" Betts said, via the Los Angeles Times.\n\nBetts said he regretted not making the trip in 2019, which manager Alex Cora and pitcher David Price also skipped, saying he felt he was a distraction. Cora recently admitted he skipped out on meeting Trump because he wanted to prioritize his home country of Puerto Rico. When the Red Sox visited the White House in May 2019, Puerto Rico was still recovering from the destruction of Hurricane Maria in 2017, and Cora wasn't satisfied with the federal government's response.\n\nAn L.A. Times writer in March pleaded with the Dodgers to tell the White House, \"Thanks, but no,\" regarding this year's visit.\n\n\"The president lost L.A. County by 33 percentage points. In his feuds with California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Trump has threatened to withhold fire disaster funds without concessions. He seems to never miss an opportunity to take a swipe at the Golden State,\" the story read, noting stakeholders' Magic Johnson's and Billie Jean King's criticisms of Trump in the past.\n\nIn June, the Dodgers said they turned away ICE agents entry to the grounds of their stadium, but ICE said that was \"false\" since they were \"never there.\" The team said the agents had \"requested permission to access the parking lots,\" but an ICE spokesperson said in an email to Fox News Digital at the time that \"ICE was never at Dodgers stadium, and thus never tried to gain access.\" In a statement of their own after ICE's denial, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) said that \"CBP vehicles were in the stadium parking lot very briefly,\" and it \"had nothing to do with the Dodgers.\"\n\nEarlier that month, local singer Nessa performed the national anthem in Spanish as a form of protest against ICE raids in the city. Outfielder Kike Hernandez, a hero of Game 6, made a social media post about the protests at the time.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"I may not be Born & Raised, but this city adopted me as one of their own,\" Hernandez wrote on Instagram. \"I am saddened and infuriated by what's happening in our country and our city.

        "title": "'The View': Sunny Hostin Says Gavin Newsom 'Laid Out the Map for the Gerrymander Battle' Against GOP, and Dems 'Really Need to Pay Attention'",
        "description": "Prop 50 passed on Tuesday night, marking another win for Democrats in the 2025 elections\n\nAmong the many victories Democrats saw on Tuesday night was the passing of Prop 50 in California and, according to \"The View\" host Sunny Hostin, Democrats in other states \"really need to pay attention to it\" if they want to be successful in future elections.\n\nCalifornians voted in favor of the amendment, which allows temporary changes to Congressional district maps as a response to partisan redistricting in Texas. Where Texas gerrymandered to secure five additional House seats, California picked up the same amount.\n\n\"I think that Democrats really need to pay attention to what Gavin Newsom did,\" Hostin said. \"He laid out the map for the gerrymander battle.\"\n\nThe ABC host was quick to point out that North Carolina and Missouri each took additional seat recently, thanks to similar plays, while Ohio took two. So, in his speech on Tuesday night, Newsom called for New York, Illinois and Colorado to introduce similar legislation to voters, to \"meet this moment head-on.\"\n\n\"And I hope the Democrats do it,\" Hostin said.\n\nWhen host Joy Behar argued that California's gerrymandering in response to Texas was simply \"tit for tat,\" Hostin pushed back, citing the potential fallout.\n\n\"It's not tit for tat Joy, because it's very important, because Donald Trump is tasking red states to basically steal the House,\" she said.\n\nHost Sara Haines conceded that, in this case, the gerrymandering was called for, but warned that in future cases, the \"pendulum\" swing of parties doing something because their opponents did it may not benefit everyone (Haines pointed to Trump's call to end the filibuster this week as an example).\n\nAt that, host Ana Navarro chimed in, wondering how else the Democrats could really take on Republican gerrymandering.\n\n\"Republicans started it, and I don't know how Democrats can just be there, like, with their hands down while they're getting beaten up,\" she said.",

        "title": "California Strikes Back in the Redistricting War",
        "description": "In July, as Republicans in Texas were pushing, at President Donald Trump's behest, to change the state's maps to net themselves as many as five more U.S. House seats in next year's midterms, Gavin Newsom, the Democratic governor of California, warned that his state might feel compelled to respond in kind. \"This is not a bluff,\" he said. In fact, it was -- or, at least, it had been at first. A month before Newsom's pronouncement, as Politico has since reported, a senior House Democrat asked Paul Mitchell, the top redistricting consultant in California, whether a tit-for-tat would be feasible. Mitchell was skeptical, not least because the state had transferred responsibility for its congressional maps to an independent commission that was popular with voters. Nonetheless, Mitchell was dispatched to tour Texas media and \"blabber about how easy it's going to be for California to redraw our districts,\" he told me. \"We were trying to bluff the state that thinks they invented bluffing.\"\n\nOver time, things got more serious. Texas rammed through its maps, even as Democrats in the state legislature absconded in an attention-grabbing, yet ultimately unsuccessful, attempt to deny quorum. Meanwhile, in California, Mitchell dug into the data and discovered not only that it would be possible to retaliate by drawing five friendlier districts for Democrats but that voters just might approve of the plan. And so Newsom and his allies teed up a ballot measure -- known as Proposition 50, or the Election Rigging Response Act -- that would ask Californians to sanction a temporary revision of the state's congressional lines, with the proviso that the independent commission would kick back in after 2030. Opponents of the proposition got a boost when the former governor Arnold Schwarzenegger -- the godfather, to mix movie metaphors, of the independent commission -- warned that \"two bad behaviors don't make a right behavior.\" But the \"No\" campaign ended up outgunned. Good-government groups that typically oppose partisan redistricting stayed on the sideline; former President Barack Obama got off of it to support Prop 50, despite his own past advocacy for nonpartisan mapmaking. On Tuesday, the polls closed, and the measure's victory was called almost immediately. \"We stood firm in response to Donald Trump's recklessness,\" Newsom said. \"After poking the bear, this bear roared.\"\n\nAs Texas and California made their moves, the redistricting war spread across the nation. Initially, it looked as though Republicans, who currently enjoy a razor-thin 219-213 majority in the House -- not counting an Arizona Democrat who has yet to be seated, after winning a special election in September -- would have more opportunities to create favorable seats. Democrats, in the states they control, appeared hamstrung by a combination of institutional constraints, a lack of political will to circumvent them, and maps that were already disproportionately blue, making it hard to squeeze out further advantage. Last week, for instance, the leader of the Maryland Senate rejected a push to redraw the state's sole Republican seat, citing both legal difficulties and philosophical opposition. (This week, Maryland's governor, Wes Moore, pressed ahead, but it's not yet clear how he'll overcome the Senate-shaped obstacle.)",

        "title": "CA GOP sues Newsom over Prop. 50, claims Latinos illegally favored in...",
        "description": "The California Republican Party filed a federal lawsuit Tuesday challenging the state's new congressional district maps, alleging Democrats illegally used race as the primary factor in redrawing boundaries to favor Latino voters.\n\nThe complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, seeks to invalidate Proposition 50, which voters approved on Tuesday to implement legislature-drawn maps for the 2026, 2028 and 2030 elections.\n\nNeither Gov. Gavin Newsom's office nor Secretary of State Shirley Weber's office responded to The Post's requests for comment.\n\nThe lawsuit names both officials in their official capacities as defendants responsible for implementing the challenged maps.\n\nPlaintiffs, including 19 residents, argue the redistricting violates the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection Clause and the 15th Amendment's protections against racial discrimination in voting.\n\n\"The California Legislature violated the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to the Constitution when it drew new congressional district lines based on race, specifically to favor Hispanic voters, without cause or evidence to justify it,\" the complaint states.\n\nThe plaintiffs are represented by attorneys from Dhillon Law Group, a San Francisco-based firm founded by prominent Republican attorney Harmeet K. Dhillon.\n\nThe lawsuit targets 16 congressional districts across California, from the Central Valley to Los Angeles and San Diego counties.\n\nCalifornia lawmakers approved the redistricting package in less than four days in August, suspending multiple procedural rules to expedite passage. The move replaced maps drawn by the state's independent Citizens Redistricting Commission in 2021 following the 2020 census.\n\nDemocratic leadership issued press releases announcing the new map \"retains and expands Voting Rights Act districts that empower Latino voters\" and creates districts designed to help Latino voters \"elect their candidates of choice.\"\n\nPaul Mitchell, the consultant who drew the challenged maps, acknowledged in public statements that race guided his work. According to the complaint, Mitchell said his \"number one thing\" was drawing a \"Latino majority/minority district\" in Los Angeles and creating a \"Latino-influenced district\" with 35% Latino voting age population.\n\nMitchell was paid by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, according to campaign finance disclosures cited in the lawsuit.\n\nThe plaintiffs request the court convene a three-judge panel, as required for constitutional challenges to statewide redistricting. They seek declaratory judgment that the maps violate the Constitution and injunctions blocking their implementation.\n\nNewsom's vanity project vote paved the way for Democrats to flip five crucial congressional seats in the 2026 midterms, coasting to victory with more than 64% -- or 4.4 million voters -- saying yes to redistricting, compared to 35% who voted against it. The Associated Press called the results promptly at 8 p.m. local time.\n\nFlanked by his wife, Jennifer Siebel Newsom, the Golden State governor wasted no time bashing President Trump in his victory speech.\n\n\"We're proud of the work that the people of the state of California did tonight to send a powerful message to a historic president,\" he said. \"Donald Trump is a historic president. He is the most historically unpopular president in modern history.\"\n\nThe partisan measure, spearheaded by Newsom, was introduced by the Democrat-led Legislature in direct response to GOP-driven redistricting in Texas that also aims at gaining five additional congressional seats.",

        "title": "Why California voters approved a redistricting ballot measure, according to the AP Voter Poll",
        "description": "WASHINGTON (AP) -- Most California voters didn't like redrawing their congressional districts to favor Democrats. But many may have felt Republicans left them with no alternative.\n\nThe AP Voter Poll, an expansive survey of more than 4,000 voters in California, captured the mixed emotions of an electorate that chose to adopt President Donald Trump's own strategy of rewriting the rules by redistricting outside of Census years. Most voters in favor of the proposition hoped to counter his efforts to preserve Republican control of the House in next year's midterm elections - even if they thought redistricting should ideally happen another way.\n\nThe ballot measure's success, as well as voters' apparent hesitations, demonstrates how many people appear to see the current redistricting fight as a political necessity, even if they don't agree with it in principle. The findings suggest that voters see this as a tense and high stakes moment for the country, where compromises may be required.\n\nAbout 9 in 10 California voters said that, generally speaking, each state's congressional district lines should be drawn by a non-partisan commission. But a majority nevertheless backed Proposition 50 to replace the existing districts with new maps crafted to send more California Democrats to the House of Representatives.\n\nRoughly 7 in 10 California voters said party control of Congress was \"very important\" to them, and those voters overwhelmingly supported the amendment to the state's constitution backed by Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat who has emerged as one of Trump's leading antagonists.\n\nNewsom said ahead of the vote that democracy itself was at risk.\n\n\"Prop 50 is not about drawing lines on a map,\" Newsom told a crowd. \"It is about holding the line to what makes us who we are.\"\n\nThe ballot measure was a response to Trump's efforts earlier this year to tilt more congressional districts toward the GOP. Voter discontent with the status quo was apparent. About half of California voters said they are angry about the country's direction, and a similar share pointed to the economy as the most important issue facing the state. Many voters have been left frustrated as Trump's pledge to vanquish inflation has gone unfulfilled, while his import taxes have created a sense of confusion and chaos among businesses and the public.\n\nThe president has successfully pushed Texas, North Carolina, Ohio and Missouri to craft new congressional districts, with Trump placing pressure on additional states in an attempt to swing midterm races that have traditionally favored the party out of the White House.\n\n\"The Unconstitutional Redistricting Vote in California is a GIANT SCAM in that the entire process, in particular the Voting itself, is RIGGED,\" Trump wrote.\n\nTwo-thirds of California voters said they were opposed to states redrawing their congressional district lines in response to how other states have drawn their lines. But the vast majority of the voters who supported the ballot measure said it was necessary to counter the changes made by Republicans in other states.\n\nCalifornia now has the chance to do that by recrafting its 52 House seats in ways that could add five Democrats to Congress in next year's elections. Democrats and voters who lean toward the Democrats -- who make up a majority of voters in the state -- overwhelmingly voted in support of the ballot measure.\n\nMany acknowledged the process so far has been unjust. About half of California voters said neither the Republicans nor the Democrats are handling the redrawing of congressional district lines fairly.\n\nBut knowing the choices made by other state legislatures, enough California voters decided they had the right reason - even if it felt like the wrong thing.",

        "description": "Dallas, TX - August 6, 2022: Former White House's chief strategist for Donald Trump Administration Steve Bannon reports from CPAC Texas 2022 conference at Hilton Anatole (Shutterstock)\n\nSteve Bannon is freaking out about Tuesday's election results that handed Democrats big wins - especially in a pair of key races.\n\nDemocrats significantly outperformed their election margins from last year and racked up wins in gubernatorial races in Virginia and New Jersey, but Bannon told Politico that President Donald Trump must take immediate action to undo Zohran Mamdani's win in the New York mayor's race and the results of the Proposition 50 redistricting measure in California.\n\n\"Two things I would do,\" Bannon told Politico. \"Number one, get [Assistant Attorney General] Harmeet Dhillon and the Justice Department to go out and file suit against this scam of [California Gov. Gavin] Newsom on this redistricting plan that went against the constitution of California. I would get the Justice Department to file suit, go get a [temporary restraining order] immediately, and then hit this thing and drag it out for a year.\"\n\n\"Number two, I would get DHS, the State Department and the Justice Department looking immediately at Mamdani, who I am convinced did not get citizenship in a fair and honest way, and get those two things rolling,\" Bannon added.\n\nHe urged the president to listen to Mamdani's post-election speech in which he directly challenged the president, who has threatened to withhold federal support for New York City if Andrew Cuomo did not win, and Trump responded with a cryptic post on Truth Social.\n\n\"There should be even more than alarm bells,\" Bannon said. \"There should be flashing red lights all over.\"\n\nBannon expressed fear that Mamdani would inspire imitators in other cities and \"squeeze\" business interests with \"Marxist\" policies.\n\n\"You're going to see a whole new group of Mamdanis in these major urban cities because they're just flooded with immigrants, right?\" Bannon said. \"That's where his vote came from, principally, and the progressive left, these kids have come up through the public school system. This is the flower of what the progressive left has delivered over the last 40 or 50 years. You saw it tonight and people, we're going to have a fight on our hands.\"\n\n\"His speech tonight could not have been nastier or more aggressive,\" he added. \"He mocked Cuomo. That is one of the first families of the Democratic Party, particularly in the state of New York.\"\n\nBannon believes Republicans must embrace Trump and the MAGA movement even tighter to avoid even worse losses in next year's midterms.\n\n\"You're either with MAGA or you're not,\" he said. \"The Republican Party has no following. It has a bunch of donors, and it has the Fox TV network, and it has Karl Rove and all these worn-out ideas you see in the House and the Senate. It's just embarrassing. The Republican Party is just a husk. When Trump is engaged, when Trump's on the ballot, when Trump's team can get out there and get low-propensity voters -- because that's the difference now in modern politics -- when they can do it, they win. When he doesn't do it, they don't.\"\n\n\"You double and triple down with Trump,\" Bannon added. \"If you're not prepared to do that, you're going to get smoked, because you're not going to see Trump voters come out, like in Virginia, just like in New Jersey.\"",

        "title": "Republicans respond to Proposition 50's success in California in all the wrong ways",
        "description": "California voters gave Gov. Gavin Newsom the green light to redraw the state's congressional maps. The response from GOP leaders is a hypocritical mess.\n\nAfter Texas Republicans redrew their state's congressional district map to give Republicans five additional U.S. House seats, Democrats in California decided they had little choice but to respond in kind. They could not, however, simply approve a gerrymandered map of their own, because state law prohibits such tactics.\n\nTo succeed, Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom and his allies would need voters' permission to create an exception to state law. The result was Proposition 50, and as my MSNBC colleague Allison Detzel explained, it was a triumph for its proponents.\n\nThe results were lopsided: Based on the latest vote tally, roughly 64% of Californians voted in support of the ballot measure, while only 36% opposed it.\n\nDemocrats already control 43 of the Golden State's 52 seats. Once the new map is approved, that total will be on track to reach 48 of the 52 seats.\n\nSeveral hours before the polls closed in California, Donald Trump wrote online that the redistricting effort was \"unconstitutional\" (a word he routinely applies to stuff he doesn't like), before adding that the voting process was \"RIGGED.\" The president concluded that the process \"is under very serious legal and criminal review,\" which sounds very much like a hollow threat.\n\nSoon after, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt insisted that there was \"fraud\" in the election, and when pressed for evidence, the president's chief spokesperson added that her baseless claim is \"just a fact\" -- because she said so.\n\nThe morning after Prop 50's landslide win, House Speaker Mike Johnson went further, calling the voters' verdict a \"tragedy,\" before condemning Newsom's \"immoral leadership\" and California Democrats' willingness to \"rig the system to win.\"\n\nSo when Republicans engage in mid-decade redistricting abuses in Texas, Missouri and North Carolina and take steps to ensure GOP victories long before voters have the chance to cast ballots, that's fine. When Democrats respond in kind, that's \"unconstitutional,\" \"fraudulent,\" \"tragic\" and evidence of a party indifferent to propriety.\n\nIt's helpful when Republican leaders clarify their position on matters like these for the public.",

        "title": "Fox News Voter Poll: California voters OK congressional redistricting plan",
        "description": "'Fox News @ Night' panelists discuss California voters passing the congressional redistricting proposition.\n\nCalifornia voters gave the green light to Proposition 50, which allows the state to redraw its congressional map to counteract a redistricting plan in the state of Texas. It will be in effect for the next three congressional election cycles and is expected to add Democratic seats to California's 52-seat delegation, only nine of which are currently held by Republicans.\n\nIt is a big win for California's Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, and for the state's Democratic Party.\n\nNot all the news is good, though, when it comes to specific issues facing the state or even whether Californians want to see their governor run for president.\n\nAccording to preliminary results from the Fox News Voter Poll, on the redistricting question itself, Golden State voters who backed redrawing the maps overwhelmingly said they did so to counteract changes made by Republicans in other states, rather than because they think it is the best way to draw congressional districts.\n\nIn contrast, the much smaller number who voted \"No\" said they did so because they do not think it is the best way to draw congressional districts, as opposed to being motivated to stop Democrats from gaining more seats in Congress.\n\nMeanwhile, the vast majority of voters generally think a nonpartisan commission should draw the districts, as opposed to the party in power - which is ironic in that such a commission is exactly what is being preempted by today's vote.\n\nWhen asked how they generally feel about states redrawing their congressional districts in response to how other states have drawn theirs, most California voters oppose the idea - again, unusual seeing as that is exactly what they voted for with Proposition 50.\n\nMore than half of Golden Staters approve of the job Newsom is doing as governor.\n\nYet as to whether Newsom should run for president in 2028, more than half said it's not a good idea.\n\nEven so, he outperforms former Vice President Kamala Harris on this measure, as these California special election voters would prefer she sticks to the sidelines - by more than two to one.\n\nWas President Donald Trump a factor in Prop 50's success? The president remains deeply unpopular in the state, with close to two-thirds disapproving of the job he is doing.\n\nHalf of those casting a ballot said they did so specifically to show their opposition to him.\n\nNORTHERN CALIFORNIA VOTERS WEIGH IN ON PROP 50 REDISTRICTING FIGHT\n\nMeanwhile, California voters reject Trump's immigration enforcement policies, with more than six in ten saying they've gone too far.\n\nA similar number oppose sending the National Guard into U.S. cities.\n\nAnd these voters who oppose Trump and his policies also overwhelmingly supported Prop 50 - in some instances by more than nine to one. It might be pointed out, however, that Trump lost California by more than 20 points in 2024, and his disapproval ratings could be exaggerated among voters in this special electorate.\n\nDespite all their negative feelings toward Trump, all is not candy and rainbows for how Californians see things at home.\n\nThe economy was by far their top issue, yet the view of the Golden State economy is not so golden, as more than six in ten said the state economy is in \"not good\" or poor shape.\n\nCALIFORNIA FARMERS PUSH BACK ON PROP 50 AS DEMOCRATS EYE NEW HOUSE MAP\n\nThe vast majority - close to nine in ten - also say their family financial situation is either holding steady or falling behind. Only about one in ten feel they are getting ahead.\n\nPlus, more than eight in ten lamented California's cost of living as unaffordable.\n\nAnother eight in 10 said crime is a problem.\n\nHowever, worried Californians are, they are equally perturbed by the state of the nation.\n\nMore than seven in 10 said they are unhappy about how things are going in the U.S., with close to half angry about the direction the country is heading.\n\nMore than nine in ten said they are concerned about political violence in the U.S.\n\nThese concerns appear to play out in the vote to redraw the congressional map, with more than nine in ten who said it is important to them which party controls Congress.\n\nBlack voters, young voters, Hispanics and college graduates were among those most inclined to back Prop 50, while those most likely to oppose it included voters with no college degree, voters ages 65 and over, and independents.\n\nCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP",

        "title": "NEWT GINGRICH: Republicans have one big thing to learn about their 2025 wipeout",
        "description": "President Donald Trump said on Wednesday morning that the ongoing government shutdown was partly to blame for the Republicans elections losses on Election Day.\n\nThe Nov. 4 off-year elections were a smashing Democratic victory. This is the first and most important lesson Republicans should take from the results.\n\nIn elections in New York City, New Jersey, Virginia, Pennsylvania, Georgia and California, there was a huge wave in favor of the Democrats. Governor Gavin Newsom's referendum victory in California will certainly shape the 2026 midterms. Yet, there were some local Republican victories, such as the one for Nassau County executive in New York, which provided the GOP hints of a better future - if Republicans are willing to study and learn from them.\n\nPresident Donald J. Trump suggested that his name not being on the ballot was a major factor in the outcome. This may be true, but it does not solve anything for Republicans. His name is not going to be on the ballot in 2026 or 2028 either. If Republicans do not learn how to connect with, motivate and turn out more Americans, we are in for a huge Democratic comeback in the next election.\n\nPart of the 2025 results are congruent with a principle I learned with President Ronald Reagan in 1980 and 1984 - and the Contract with America campaign in 1994. Wave elections carry everything with them. The deeply flawed and vulnerable Democratic nominee for attorney general in Virginia won - despite having written about killing the Republican Virginia Speaker of the House and hoping his children would die. The larger Democratic wave carried him past his own despicable behavior.\n\nTRUMP'S SHADOW LOOMS LARGE OVER HEATED RACES ONE MONTH BEFORE ELECTION DAY\n\nRepublicans would like New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani to be the future of the Democratic Party. But the outcome of the 2025 election suggests that Governors-elect Abigail Spanberger in Virginia and Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey are much more likely to lead the party. The centrists are returning. This may encourage Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro to consider running in 2028.\n\nWhen you look closely, Spanberger and Sherrill have a surprising amount in common. Both have national security backgrounds (one as a CIA agent, the other as an Annapolis graduate serving in the Navy). Both are mothers (Spanberger has three children, Sherrill has four). Both campaigned as moderates and, when necessary, simply lied about the radical components of their records.\n\nIn a real sense, the Spanberger-Sherrill victories represent the re-emergence of the Obama formula. Former President Barack Obama perfected campaigning as a commonsense moderate while governing as a liberal, sometimes radical, policymaker. It made perfect sense that Obama did not endorse Mamdani. It would have weakened Obama's image as a likable centrist.\n\nWHAT THE RESULTS OF THE 2025 ELECTIONS MAY MEAN FOR DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS\n\nThere was another characteristic of the Democrats' victories which Republicans historically find hard to learn: the power of message discipline. In New York, New Jersey and Virginia, the mantra of the Democrats was affordability and the economy (the top issues concerning Americans). Republicans tried to raise social issues, such as men in girls' sports.\n\nFocusing in on this point, Republicans should make the economy their mission.\n\nThe fact is, the economy is theirs to lose. The One Big Beautiful Bill created enormous incentives for investing in America. Trump's tariffs will ultimately tilt the scales toward American manufacturing over foreign manufacturing. And he has been personally involved in selling products and signing up capital investment.\n\nEVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT ELECTION DAY 2025: CRITICAL ELECTIONS, BALLOT MEASURES AND MORE\n\nIf all this works, there should be a Trump Boom by July 2026. If that happens, the Republicans will own the economy issue, and the Republican Congress will be safe. However, if the economy is anemic or seen as underperforming in 2026, the Democrats will almost certainly win the House by a significant margin.\n\nIf Republicans study and take to heart Tuesday's lessons, the long-term drift toward the GOP will continue. But if Republicans refuse to listen to all the American people (and not only their supporters) - and only focus on what the Democratic winners did wrong (and not what they did right) - the Trump majority could be much shorter and less effective.\n\nIn 1980, President Ronald Reagan won a landslide election. Two years later, Republicans lost 26 House seats and seven governorships. A bad economy and some real communications mistakes (including scaring senior citizens about Social Security) led to a dramatic setback for Reagan. By 1983, former Vice President Walter Mondale was running ahead of Reagan in some polls. However, the Reagan team methodically thought through where the American people were - and what they wanted done. By 1984, Reagan recovered and won 49 states.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\n\nIn 1990, there was a weak economy. The Republican Party had been demoralized by President George H.W. Bush breaking his \"Read my lips: no new taxes\" pledge. The result was a disappointing off-year election. Republicans lost a Senate seat, and four GOP incumbent governors were defeated. Dissatisfaction with both parties led to two independent governors being elected. The House pickup would have been bigger since the Democrats had a 7.8% popular vote advantage, but the Democrats had a 267 to 167 majority, so it was hard for them to pick up a lot more seats.\n\nFocusing in on this point, Republicans should make the economy their mission. The fact is, the economy is theirs to lose.\n\nThe difference between 1982 and 1990 was that the Reagan team understood they had to change course to win in 1984. The Bush team simply could not bring themselves to confront how unhappy their base was - and how big the scale of change would have to be to win re-election. As a result, Ross Perot ran as a third-party candidate and helped end the 12-year Republican presidential ascendency.\n\nCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe big question for President Trump and the Republicans is: Will they listen to the American people and learn what went wrong like Reagan? Or are they going to shrug off a bad election and stumble forward with no serious introspection like Bush?",

Prior to that, he released a clip superimposing a sombrero on Jeffries' head as the government careened toward a record setting shutdown.\n\nNewsom's digital chest-thumping comes on the heels of California voters passing his Proposition 50 ballot initiative, which will redraw the congressional map to include five additional Democrat-leaning districts to counter GOP redistricting efforts in other states.\n\n\"What a night for the Democratic Party -- a party that is in its ascendancy, a party that's on its toes, no longer on its heels,\" the governor proclaimed late Tuesday.\n\nDemocrats also racked up victories in the New Jersey and Virginia gubernatorial races, expanded their majority in the Virginia House of Delegates, retained their majority on the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, and even won statewide office in Georgia.\n\nThe strong showing has given Democrats a renewed sense of optimism following their electoral dubbing last year.\n\nNewsom's montage also included an AI clip of Trump weeping while wearing a red hat saying \"Newsom was right about everything.\"\n\nIn addition to the videos, the California governor used his official press account to drop bizarre AI images depicting him feeding a baby Trump, putting a pacifier in baby Trump's mouth, and pushing a baby Trump around in a stroller.\n\n\"The whole expression was to not allow it to be normalized. It was becoming normalized,\" Newsom told NBC's \"Meet the Press\" last week explaining his social media antics.",

        "title": "'The results stunned him': How pollster convinced Gavin Newsom to make massive gamble",
        "description": "California Governor Gavin Newsom looks on as he attends an event, to announce the Golden State Literacy Plan and deployment of literacy coaches statewide, at the Clinton Elementary School in Compton, California, U.S. June 5, 2025. REUTERS/Daniel Cole\n\nThe California redistricting ballot measure passed Tuesday with overwhelming support, but sources who worked on the campaign say it started off looking like a dangerous gamble.\n\nPolitico spoke to more than 20 campaign strategists, politicians, activists and others involved with Proposition 50 about the decision to roll the dice on a measure that started with just 38 percent support for Gov. Gavin Newsom's plan for allowing the legislature to redraw the state's congressional maps.\n\n\"A loss here would reverberate well beyond Sacramento: Trump could point to California -- the state that sued, defied and mocked him -- as proof that even a blue-state bulwark was no match for his drive to rejigger the midterm playing field, while Newsom would own a massive whiff against his favorite foil,\" Politico reported. \"It would be the Fox News chyron Democrats most fear: 'TRUMP BEATS CALIFORNIA.'\"\n\nThe plan started off as a bluff to force Texas Republicans to back down on their own plan, pushed by President Donald Trump, to redraw their own maps to rig next year's midterms in favor of GOP candidates, and that initial poll warned of a humiliating loss for Newsom and a potential drag on Democratic congressional candidates - but it turns out they were simply asking the wrong question.\n\n\"Paul Mitchell, a data expert who was busily fashioning new district maps for the congressional delegation, had put his own poll in the field,\" Politico reported. \"He tested a hypothetical ballot measure that would hand redrawing power back to the Legislature but he, in his words, 'wrapped the redistricting in a reform burrito' -- adding language that emphasized the effort would be temporary and only apply if Texas redrew its maps while affirming California's support for national nonpartisan redistricting.\"\n\n\"The results stunned him,\" the report added. \"Nearly 80 percent of respondents supported independent redistricting and, two questions later, roughly the same number backed new, politically-motivated maps.\"\n\nMitchell is not a member of the governor's inner circle, so he showed his results to longtime Newsom pollster David Binder, and the governor's team added another crucial change by putting the proposed maps themselves on the ballot.\n\n\"With the modified proposal in place, Binder conducted a second poll where the measure got 52 percent support -- a marked improvement from the sub-40 percent result earlier that month,\" Politico reported. \"For many Democratic voters, reservations that 'two wrongs don't make a right' were suddenly subsumed by a hunger to sock it to the president.\"\n\nAnother senior Newsom adviser, Sean Clegg, added a final touch - having the Legislature designate the measure as Proposition 50 - that proved highly effective in getting the measure approved.\n\n\"A ready-made campaign slogan -- A yes vote on Prop 50 would protect elections 'in all 50 states' -- was now enshrined in law,\" Politico reported. \"It was the earliest glimpse of the nationalization strategy that would undergird every piece of campaign messaging.\"",

        "title": "GOP urges Democrat governor to deploy National Guard to Charlotte as crime surges",
        "description": "California Gov. Gavin Newsom threatened to sue the Trump administration if it sends National Guard troops to San Francisco. (via Gavin Newsom/X)\n\nCiting frustrations with persistent crime, a trio of North Carolina lawmakers is urging Democratic Gov. Josh Stein to deploy the National Guard in Charlotte, saying the state of the city has become \"increasingly dire.\"\n\n\"Recently, the city faced eight homicides in seven days. The murder rate in uptown Charlotte is now 200% higher than it was a year ago,\" the letter states. \"According to the Fraternal Order of Police, aggravated assaults involving knives or guns have risen from 86 in 2024 to 111 in 2025, and personal strong-arm robberies have increased from 26 to 31 in the same period.\"\n\nRep. Mark Harris, R-N.C., one of the letter's authors, said the request doesn't just come from the state's congressional delegation.\n\n\"This is not just my idea. This is the Fraternal Order of Police that had come, saying that they believed this is important and asking the governor and mayor to step up and do it,\" Harris said, alluding to a similar letter published by Charlotte-Mecklenburg law enforcement earlier this year.\n\nMAJOR CITY POLICE UNIONS SUPPORT FEDERAL TROOP DEPLOYMENTS, BUT LOCAL LEADERS ARE PUSHING BACK\n\nThe letter's three signatories, Harris, Rep. Pat Harrigan and Rep. Chuck Edwards, all represent the Charlotte area.\n\nThe North Carolina letter comes as President Donald Trump has used the National Guard to bring attention to crime in cities like Washington, D.C., Memphis, Chicago and others. So far, the administration has deployed the National Guard to six urban areas and floated deployments in another five -- even as courts weigh the use of federal troops to address domestic crime.\n\nThe letter from the North Carolina lawmakers pointed to those deployments as a template for success.\n\n\"Other cities have deployed the National Guard and seen positive results. In Washington, D.C., when President Trump deployed troops under his lawful authority, the city promptly saw a reduction in crime, including twelve consecutive days without a single homicide,\" the letter states.\n\nThat's also the thinking of members of the House Republican Conference leadership. Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., called it a continuation of the administration's work. Scalise serves the conference as majority leader -- the No. 2 Republican in the chamber.\n\n\"Millions of Americans don't feel safe in many once-great cities, and President Trump is working with House Republicans to change that. As we've seen in D.C. and Memphis, President Trump took decisive action, cleaned up our streets, and made those cities safer,\" Scalise said.\n\n\"I commend my colleagues from North Carolina for calling out the violent crime in Charlotte and working to make the city safer for residents and visitors, and encourage more leaders to do the same,\" he added.\n\nMEMPHIS RESIDENTS SPLIT OVER NATIONAL GUARD DEPLOYMENT TO FIGHT CITY'S CRIME\n\nAccording to the Charlotte Police Department's quarterly statistics report, violent crimes, commercial burglaries and larcenies from automobiles have all gone up in Charlotte since last year. But other crimes like homicides, rapes, property crimes and arson have come down modestly from levels in 2024. In many categories, Charlotte's current crime levels are meaningfully lower than rates in 2022 and 2023, with some exceptions.\n\nHarris thinks they could go lower.\n\nHe doesn't envision the National Guard deployment as a long-term solution to fighting crime. Instead, Harris believes the increased law enforcement presence could create an opening for the local police force to find their footing.\n\n\"What I hope comes out of it is that in that time, the police are able to go after whoever these bad guys are, that are threatening this environment of crime. And then, at the end of the day, it's going to create a hope, an outcry from the public that says, 'We're not going to accept our crime-ridden city anymore.'\"\n\nWhen asked what needs to change to make Charlotte's safety a constant, with or without the National Guard, Harris said the city needs to prioritize its policies and resources on keeping violent offenders off the streets.\n\n\"After the murder of Iryna Zarutska, it brought to light a real issue with not keeping criminals behind bars,\" Harris said, referring to the 23-year-old Ukrainian refugee who was stabbed to death on a Charlotte train.\n\nCHARLOTTE CITY COUNCIL MEMBER CALLS OUT 'PAPER-THIN' CRIME STATISTICS AFTER UKRAINIAN REFUGEE'S KILLING\n\n\"In her case, the guy had been arrested 14 times, been put out on the street. These are things that have a lot of issues to be addressed. That's a judiciary issue.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAlthough past efforts to deploy the National Guard have been met with protest from Democratic governors in other states, Harris hopes that Stein will work with the Trump administration as needed if it becomes clear a deployment is needed.\n\nStein's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

        "title": "This was a deafening message  --  and Trump knows it",
        "description": "Donald Trump gestures during a cabinet meeting at the White House. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst\n\nOne year and a day after Donald Trump won a second term as president - and on the 35th day of the US government shutdown, which has tied a record for the longest in history - the Democrats swept to victory in key races across the county.\n\nDemocratic candidates won the governorships in the states of Virginia and New Jersey, while Zohran Mamdani became New York City's next mayor.\n\nThe Democrats may have just become the winners of the fight to reopen the government, too.\n\nSixteen years ago, then-President Barack Obama was staggered by Republicans winning the governorships in Virginia and New Jersey in the 2009 elections.\n\nThe message was indelible: voters wanted to put a check on Obama and his wide-ranging agenda, from health care to global warming. Many Americans wanted him to cool his jets, including on what would become his signature achievement, Obamacare.\n\nThe following year, in the 2010 midterm elections, the Democrats lost more than 60 seats and their majority in the House. For the next six years, Republicans had a veto over whatever bills Obama wanted Congress to enact.\n\nWith Democrats now winning the governorships in those two states, Trump and his Republican allies in Congress have just been sent the same message: you need to be checked, too.\n\nGoing into Tuesday's elections, Trump's approval rating in one major poll was just above 40%, and his disapproval rating just under 60% - the highest it's been since the January 6 2021 attack on the Capitol.\n\nIndependent voters, who swung Trump's way in last year's election, are now disapproving of his performance by a 69-30% margin.\n\nTrump's leadership of what he calls the \"hottest country in the world\" is falling short in voters' eyes on a number of key issues: inflation, management of the economy, tariffs, crime, immigration, Ukraine and Gaza.\n\nThe US government has also been shuttered since October 1. Government agencies have been closed to the public, and hundreds of thousands of government employees are going without paychecks, while thousands of others have been laid off.\n\nMillions of Americans have been affected by flight delays or cancellations due to air traffic controller staffing issues. And food stamps to 42 million Americans have been suspended, with the Trump administration only relenting to provide partial payments in response to a court order.\n\nClosing the government was not solely the doing of Trump and the Republicans in Congress. After nearly a year of laying prostrate and appearing pathetically ineffective in responding to Trump and his agenda, the Democrats finally got off the mat to fight back.\n\nOf all the issues with Trump's so-called \"One Big Beautiful Bill\" - which contained huge tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations, huge spending cuts for Medicaid, huge increases in spending to control immigration, more funding for fossil fuels and an increase in the debt ceiling - Democrats seized on one glaring omission from the legislation.\n\nAt the end of this year, subsidies are due to expire that more than 24 million Americans rely on to purchase health insurance under Obamacare. As a result, millions are projected to lose their health care coverage.\n\nThat is the cross Democrats chose to die on. They've told the Trump administration: you want to keep the government open? Keep the insurance subsidies flowing. Fix it now.\n\nRepublicans in Congress have had no interest in caving to Democratic demands. They've argued Democrats must agree to reopen the government before discussing the subsidies. Their calculation: voters will turn on the Democrats for the turmoil caused by the shutdown.\n\nTrump wanted nothing to do with any such negotiations either. Two days before the elections, he said he \"won't be extorted\".\n\nBut a recent poll shows 52% of Americans blame Trump and the Republicans for the shutdown, compared to 42% who blame Democrats.\n\nThe wins in Virginia and New Jersey drove this message home. Yes, the Democrats triggered the current shutdown. But the president owns the economy. For better or worse, Trump will own the economy going into next year's midterm elections, too.\n\nHow can the Democrats get out of the shutdown box with a win? With the leverage they just gained in the elections. Republican stonewalling after these election defeats will hurt them even more.\n\nThere are two routes forward.\n\nFirst, Democrats could reach an agreement with the Republicans on a fix to the health insurance issue, with a vote in Congress by Christmas to get the subsidies restored. A bipartisan compromise appears now to be in the works.\n\nSecond, if such an agreement cannot be reached, the Democrats can introduce a bill to restore the subsidies on their own, with an up-or-down vote in both the House and Senate. If this was voted down, the Democrats would then have a winning issue to take to the midterm elections next November. The voters would know who to blame - and who to reward.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson has prevented the House from meeting for more than six weeks, but it has to come back in session to vote to reopen the government at some point.\n\nTrump is also insisting the Senate change its rules to allow a simple majority to be able to reopen the government - without any compromises on health insurance subsidies. But this is not a viable political option after these election results.\n\nThere were two other big Democratic winners on Tuesday. California voters approved a redistricting plan intended to partially offset Republicans' gerrymandering of congressional electorates across the country for the midterm elections.\n\nIt was a high-risk strategy by California Governor Gavin Newsom, and it paid off handsomely: Newsom is now considered the frontrunner for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2028.\n\nAnd Mamdani, a Muslim socialist, was elected the Democratic mayor of New York City. Trump will no doubt continue to rubbish him as a communist radical extremist and follow through on his threats to cut federal funding for the largest city in the US.\n\nMamdani's victory also places him on the national stage, but not centre stage. The Sinatra doctrine from his hit song New York, New York -- \"If I can make it there, I'll make it anywhere\" -- does not quite apply in this situation.\n\nTo take back Congress next year and the White House in 2028, the Democrats will need all kinds of flowers to bloom -- not just Mamdani's bouquet. In 2028, the party is going to have to shop in a bigger greenhouse.",

        "title": "The results are in: 2025's biggest winner and losers from the off-year elections",
        "description": "Democratic New York City mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani addresses his supporters after winning a race that saw its highest turnout in decades.\n\nThe 2025 off-year election cycle has come to a close, with Democrats emerging victorious in a handful of high-profile elections.\n\nThe election season was much more muted compared to 2024's wild federal election that delivered President Donald Trump a victory over then-Vice President Kamala Harris, with 2025 spotlighting the mayoral election in New York City, and a pair of gubernatorial elections in Virginia and New Jersey.\n\nFox News Digital compiled Election Day 2025's biggest winners and losers following months of campaigning on top voter concerns, namely affordability and the economy.\n\nWHAT THE RESULTS OF THE 2025 ELECTIONS MAY MEAN FOR DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS\n\nFollowing 2024's federal election that left the Democratic Party working to find its footing after Harris' loss, Democrats now have New Jersey Rep. Mikie Sherrill and former Virginia Rep. Abigail Spanberger ascending as the top leaders of their respective states, broadening the party's pool of leaders with new roles.\n\nNew Jersey Democrats were on the edge of their seats in the deep blue state after Trump made inroads with voters during the 2024 election, teeing up what Republicans saw as the opening to potentially flipping the state. Democrats, however, held their ground in the historically blue state with New Jersey Rep. Mikie Sherrill defeating Trump-backed Republican Jack Ciattarelli.\n\n\"This was a tough fight and this is a tough state,\" Sherrill said in her victory speech. \"But I know you, New Jersey. I have fought for you. I've spoken with thousands of you over this last year. I know your struggles, your hopes, and your dreams.\"\n\nSpanberger notched a victory over Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears just roughly an hour after polls closed in the Old Dominion State.\n\n\"We sent a message to every corner of the commonwealth,\" Spanberger said in her acceptance speech. \"A message to our neighbors and our fellow Americans across the country. We sent a message to the whole world that in 2025, Virginia chose pragmatism over partisanship. We chose our commonwealth over chaos. You all chose leadership that will focus relentlessly on what matters most: lowering costs, keeping our communities safe and strengthening our economy.\"\n\nTHE TRUE COST OF THE 2025 ELECTIONS\n\nUpon her inauguration in January, Spanberger will become the first female governor of Virginia.\n\nThe pair were viewed as potential new leaders of the Democratic Party as they worked to secure their gubernatorial wins. Now, they will head to their respective state Capitols armed with years of Congressional know-how and an opportunity to better cement their leadership within the party.\n\nSocialist candidate Zohran Mamdani, who ran as a Democrat, secured his win as the Big Apple's next mayor in an election expected to deliver him favorable results as he ran against former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo -- who was forced to run as an independent after losing the Democratic primary to Mamdani in June -- and Republican Curtis Sliwa.\n\n\"My friends, we have toppled a political dynasty,\" Mamdani said in his victory speech.\n\n\"New York, tonight you have delivered a mandate for change,\" he added. \"A mandate for a new kind of politics. A mandate for a city we can afford. And a mandate for a government that delivers exactly that.\"\n\nMEET THE CANDIDATES AIMING TO MAKE HISTORY IN THE 2025 ELECTIONS\n\nThe election notched a massive win for the left-wing faction of the Democratic Party. Mamdani was a relatively unknown state assembly member and democratic socialist who ascended the political ladder amid his primary campaign. He championed progressive plans for the city, such as freezing stabilized rents, increasing the city's minimum wage and canceling fares for bus rides.\n\nThe race earned national coverage as conservatives slammed the socialist candidate as a threat to the city's massive economy and status as America's de facto symbol of capitalism, and warned he holds antisemitic views in a city with a massive Jewish population.\n\nOther socialist candidates also have made big waves this cycle, including in Minneapolis where left-wing candidate Omar Fateh who has been described as the \"Mamdani of Minneapolis.\" The mayor's race advanced to ranked choice voting on Tuesday after none of the candidates received at least 50% of the vote.\n\nMinneapolis allows voters to rank up to three candidates in its municipal races. Incumbent Democrat Mayor Jacob Frey and Fateh received the most first-choice results, Fox News reported.\n\nLong before Election Day, President Donald Trump made clear he was no fan of New York City's Mamdani, teeing up an expected political battle between the pair for the forseeable future.\n\nTrump is famous for his long-running political spats with Democrat foes, such as California Gov. Gavin Newsom and California Sen. Adam Schiff, frequently spotlighting the opponents as examples as to why Democrat policies fail while championing his MAGA approach.\n\nNow, Trump has who likely will be another longstanding political foe as he continues his ongoing campaign against socialism and antisemitism.\n\n\"Zohran Mamdani, a 100% Communist Lunatic, has just won the Dem Primary, and is on his way to becoming Mayor,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social in June. \"We've had Radical Lefties before, but this is getting a little ridiculous. He looks TERRIBLE, his voice is grating, he's not very smart.\"\n\n\"Any Jewish person that votes for Zohran Mamdani, a proven and self professed JEW HATER, is a stupid person!!!\" the president claimed in a Truth Social post on Tuesday.\n\nMamdani is Muslim and has been accused of holding antisemitic views, including for declining to condemn the phrase \"globalize the intifada.\" The democratic socialist, however, has denied the claims and vowed to \"do everything in my power to protect Jewish New Yorkers.\"\n\nEVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT ELECTION DAY 2025: CRITICAL ELECTIONS, BALLOT MEASURES AND MORE\n\nRepublican candidates across the board in the handful of high-profile elections failed to rally enough support for their tickets, handing Democrats massive wins from the Virginia attorney general race to the party retaining control of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court.\n\nThe election cycle focused on the New York City mayoral race, and the pair of gubernatorial races in New Jersey and Virginia, where Democrats celebrated victories long before the clock struck midnight on Election Day.\n\nRepublicans, however, failed to rally support in a handful of other state elections, including three Democratic justices on the Pennsylvania Supreme Court defending their jobs from challengers. Republican Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares also failed to retain his seat against Jay Jones, who was mired in controversy after text messages showed him envisioning the murder of a former Republican leader.\n\nTRUMP'S SHADOW LOOMS LARGE OVER HEATED RACES ONE MONTH BEFORE ELECTION DAY\n\nIn California, Newsom and Democrats passed a ballot initiative to redraw the state's congressional lines, which could flip up to five Republican seats blue in the liberal state.\n\nNewsom launched the redistricting effort, Proposition 50, earlier in 2025 to counter the Trump administration's promotion that Republicans in states such as Texas redistrict their own lines.\n\nAhead of Mamdani's election Tuesday, business owners and conservative political leaders sounded off with concern that the democratic socialist's policies could cripple the city's economy and spark businesses to flee.\n\n\"We will lose businesses in droves,\" Republican Councilwoman Vickie Paladino said in July of Mamdani's candidacy. \"You got NASDAQ, you got Wall Street. They could work anywhere. They could work in Jersey, they could work in Connecticut. They don't need to be in Lower Manhattan.\"\n\nMamdani campaigned on proposals to raise the corporate tax rate, shift more of the tax burden to \"richer and whiter neighborhoods\" and add a flat 2% income tax on earners making over $1 million to pay for other programs that will fund other \"free\" services for the residents.\n\nSmall Business Administrator Kelly Loeffler added that the city is already strained by inflation, high taxes and regulation, and that the election of a socialist could cripple businesses.\n\n\"New York is the capital of capitalism and small businesses,\" Loeffler told Fox Digital in September.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"Small businesses are very concerned about what might be coming down the road, particularly as they hear threats of socialist policies, government takeover of industries, rising regulation, rising taxes, a minimum wage that may skyrocket to $30 an hour and cost thousands of jobs,\" she said, adding that New York City businesses have already witnessed an \"eroding customer base.\"",

        "description": "This is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here.\n\nOff-year elections are never quite the crystal ball for midterms that political junkies want, but one thing that last night's results seem to convey clearly is that many voters are unhappy with President Donald Trump.\n\nElections for New York City mayor, governors of New Jersey and Virginia, and gerrymandering in California had their own local dynamics, but voters in these heavily nationalized contests were united in their rejection of Trump and his priorities. The results give some reason to doubt Trump's claim that his 2024 victory was \"a historic realignment\" of American politics. But although the success of Democrats running the spectrum from moderate to progressive may soothe the pre-2026 nerves of Trump's opposition, it also means there are no pat answers to the question of how best to run against him.\n\nZohran Mamdani, a charismatic Democratic newcomer, won the New York mayoralty by a wide margin. Mamdani captured roughly 50 percent of the vote in a three-way race, despite the president's endorsement of his chief rival, Andrew Cuomo, and threats to cut off most federal funding to the city. Or was it in part because of Trump? The president is detested in his hometown, and although Mamdani relentlessly pivoted away from national politics toward issues of affordability in the city, the contrast between the young, cheerful immigrant and aging, cranky nativist president was unmissable. Mamdani was only too delighted to call attention to Trump's late backing of Cuomo as a way of energizing his own voters. His victory immediately makes him one of the leaders of the Democratic Party's left wing, alongside Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nIn Virginia, meanwhile, Abigail Spanberger staked a claim to leadership of the party's moderate wing. The former U.S. representative and CIA officer trounced the Republican Winsome Earle-Sears by 15 points to become the commonwealth's governor, replacing the term-limited GOP incumbent Glenn Youngkin. Spanberger's victory was widely anticipated, but the margin is on the higher end of expectations. She carried to victory not only the lieutenant-governor candidate, Ghazala Hashmi, but also Jay Jones, the nominee for attorney general. Democrats gained at least 13 seats and maintained control in the House of Delegates as well.\n\nJones's campaign was shaken late by the publication of text messages from 2022 in which he wrote that if he had two bullets and had a chance to shoot Hitler, Pol Pot, or the then-Republican speaker of the House of Delegates, he'd shoot the Republican twice. In the aftermath of Charlie Kirk's assassination, the messages caused a firestorm, but although Democrats condemned the messages, they did not seek to force Jones out of the race. On Election Day, the blue wave carried him over the incumbent Republican, Jason Miyares.\n\nAlso winning was the New Jersey Democrat Mikie Sherrill, a current U.S. representative who ran a campaign focused squarely on Trump. The race gave Democrats jitters: Four years ago, the Republican Jack Ciattarelli came within three points of unseating Governor Phil Murphy, and polls in recent weeks showed Ciattarelli -- once again on the ballot -- close behind Sherrill. In the end, though, Sherrill won by some 13 points.\n\nProposition 50, California's referendum on redrawing U.S. House districts, scored an even larger win, with more than 60 percent of voters favoring it in incomplete results. The ballot initiative sought to bypass the state's independent redistricting commission and create maps that would give Democrats a chance to pick up five more seats in Congress. Governor Gavin Newsom was the face of the gerrymander, arguing it was essential as a counterweight to several states, including Texas, Missouri, and North Carolina, adding Republican districts at Trump's behest. The vote not only aids Democrats' midterm hopes but raises Newsom's profile as a Trump adversary -- and 2028 presidential hopeful.\n\nIt was that kind of night for Democrats: Up and down the ballot, races not only went their way but did so by wide margins. (In Pennsylvania, three Democratic justices on the state supreme court won elections to keep their seats.) That follows a run of successes in special elections. But drawing simple conclusions from these results is challenging, given the very different personalities, campaigns, and platforms that brought Democrats to victory. Perhaps the only unifying thread was former President Barack Obama, who campaigned for Spanberger and Sherrill, endorsed Prop 50, and reached out to Mamdani even as other national Democrats kept their distance. The big lesson may be that Democrats' best bet is to run candidates who effectively represent and speak to the places they're running, rather than pursuing a single ideology.\n\nThese results have only limited ability to restrain Trump's abuses of power right now, and although they are the best that Democrats could hope for, they also don't guarantee success in 2026. What the returns do show clearly is that Democratic voters are highly motivated to vote against Trump, despite polls finding that they are disgusted with their own party. This may sound familiar. Trump has never been popular with Americans as a whole: He won a minority of the popular vote in 2016, led his party to defeat in 2018, and lost in 2020. In the 2022 midterms, his unpopularity was a major reason Republicans underperformed.\n\nBut Trump's victory in 2024 called that into question. Trump and his allies treated it as an \"unprecedented and powerful mandate\" for radical right-wing governance. A year later, this election suggests a different interpretation: that Trump's victory was driven by high inflation, Joe Biden's disastrous decision to try to run for reelection, an underwhelming Kamala Harris campaign, and an anti-incumbent mood. Americans still aren't sold on the Democratic Party, but the anti-MAGA majority has reemerged.",

        "title": "Opinion | Voters rejected Trump's influence in these 7 key races",
        "description": "Abigail Spanberger during her election night rally in Richmond, V.A. on Nov. 4, 2025.Win McNamee / Getty Images\n\nPresident Donald Trump lost big in Tuesday's elections, as voters rejected candidates he endorsed and causes he championed around the country.\n\nIn the first major elections of Trump's second term, his unpopularity proved a drag on Republican nominees, a sign of potential trouble for the GOP in next year's midterms.\n\nTwo Democrats who won governors races, meantime, were both first elected to the House in the 2018 midterm elections during Trump's first term.\n\nWhy it mattered: Spanberger first won a House seat in 2018 by running against Trump and she repeated that campaign tactic, tying Earle-Sears to his policies whenever possible.\n\nWhat she said: In her victory speech, Spanberger criticized the federal government shutdown. \"Virginia's economy doesn't work when Washington treats our Virginia workers as expendable,\" she said. \"And to those across the Potomac who are attacking our jobs and our economy, I will not stand by silently.\"\n\nWho won: Democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani beat former Gov. Andrew Cuomo (running as an independent) by nine points, while Republican Curtis Sliwa came in a distant third.\n\nWhy it mattered: Trump repeatedly singled out Mamdani for criticism, threatening to withhold federal funding from the city if he won and urging voters to back Cuomo. Mamdani called himself \"Donald Trump's worst nightmare\" and pledged to fight him on key issues.\n\nWhat he said: \"In this moment of political darkness, New York will be the light. Here, we believe in standing up for those we love, whether you are an immigrant, a member of the trans community, one of the many Black women that Donald Trump has fired from a federal job, a single mom still waiting for the cost of groceries to go down or anyone else with their back against the wall, your struggle is ours too.. We can respond to oligarchy and authoritarianism with the strength it fears, not the appeasement it craves. After all, if anyone can show a nation betrayed by Donald Trump how to defeat him, it is the city that gave rise to him. ... So Donald Trump, since I know you're watching, I have four words for you: Turn the volume up.\"\n\nWho won: Democrat Mikie Sherrill, who also first won a House seat in the 2018 midterms, defeated Republican Jack Ciattarelli by double digits.\n\nWhy it mattered: Ciattarelli, who narrowly lost a governor's race four years ago after keeping his distance from Trump, ran with his full endorsement this time. Sherrill, meantime, tied him to Trump's handling of the economy and the recent SNAP food aid cuts, among other things.\n\nWhat she said: \"As the president is backing away from this ideal, cutting SNAP, ripping away health care, terminating Gateway, we here in New Jersey are bound to fight for a different future for our children,\" she said. \"We see how clearly important liberty is. We know that no one in our great state is safe when our neighbors are targeted, ignoring the law and the Constitution.\"\n\nWhat happened: A ballot measure backed by Gov. Gavin Newsom to adopt a Democratic redistricting plan as a counter to Republican attempts to gerrymander other states passed resoundingly.\n\nWhy it mattered: The measure will allow California to redraw its maps to offset the Texas redistricting passed earlier this year, helping Democrats stay competitive in next year's midterms.\n\nWhat they said: \"What a night for the Democratic Party -- a party that is in its ascendancy, a party that's on its toes, no longer on its heels,\" Newsom said.\n\nWhat happened: A conservative-backed ballot measure to add new restrictions on voting by mail and require photo ID before casting a ballot, among other changes, lost by double digits.\n\nWhy it mattered: The measure was the latest attempt to impose more stringent requirements on voting, echoing many of the changes that Trump has called for since losing in 2020. These restrictions have tended to fare poorly on the ballot, however, as voters like voting.\n\nWhat they said: \"Maine voters know that our elections are safe and secure, and they sent a loud message today that they will fight to protect voting rights,\" David Farmer, campaign manager for the group Save Maine Absentee Voting, said in a statement.\n\nWhat happened: Three Democratic justices on the state Supreme Court won retention votes by double digits after an unusually aggressive Republican campaign to unseat them.\n\nWhy it mattered: Democrats will likely still have a majority on the Pennsylvania Supreme Court during the 2028 presidential election, when they might be called on to resolve election-related lawsuits. Two of the justices won 10-year terms, while the third will serve until she turns 75 in 2027, the state's mandatory retirement age for justices.\n\nWhat they said: \"I'm really honored that the people showed this confidence in me,\" Justice David Wecht told NBC News. \"I intend to serve the people with fidelity.\"\n\nWhat happened: Democratic Mayor Aftab Pureval overwhelmingly defeated Republican Cory Bowman in the race, which is technically for a nonpartisan post.\n\nWhy it mattered: Bowman is Vice President JD Vance's half-brother and said he was inspired to run when he was attending the inauguration.\n\nWhat they said: Pureval said Bowman called to concede even before the race was called and was \"very classy.\" He said he offered him an opportunity to work together, which Bowman said he would accept.",

        "title": "Was Mamdani's Win a Referendum on Capitalism?",
        "description": "Andrew here. There is so much to unpack about last night's election results; we dive into all of it below. Clearly Democrats won big all around the nation, perhaps as a repudiation of sorts of the Trump administration. Having said that, the victory by Zohran Mamdani raises new questions about whether his success will spur other Democratic candidates to go farther left and become more populist.\n\nIt also raises enormous questions for New York City -- the capital of capitalism is set to be led by a democratic socialist -- and perhaps for the future of American capitalism more broadly. Amid growing inequality and an affordability crisis, will Americans turn toward socialism, or is this just a politically idiosyncratic moment? Many corporate leaders have warned that businesses and wealthy individuals would leave the city if he won, and we will be watching to see whether that actually happens.\n\nAlso: Gov. Gavin Newsom's political career got a boost last night, and we've got some thoughts on the role of prediction markets.\n\nThe election takeaways\n\nTuesday's election results were awash in blue, as Democrats won major contests across the nation, including in New York City and California.\n\nThe winners -- like Zohran Mamdani, Representative Mikie Sherrill, Abigail Spanberger and Gov. Gavin Newsom -- may reflect different parts of the political spectrum. But their victories also represent pushback to parts of President Trump's agenda.\n\nWhat to know:\n\n* Mamdani handily beat Andrew Cuomo and Curtis Sliwa, the Republican, in New York's mayoral race, overcoming widespread opposition from the city's business elite.\n\n* Newsom's plan to redraw California's congressional district lines in Democrats' favor won significant support.\n\n* Sherrill decisively defeated Jack Ciattarelli, whom Trump endorsed, in the New Jersey governor's race.\n\n* Spanberger beat Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears and will become Virginia's first female governor.\n\nThe results reflect Democratic anger at Trump:\n\n* The California redistricting plan, Proposition 50, was explicitly aimed at efforts by Trump and Republican allies to rejigger state maps in the G.O.P.'s favor.* Mamdani mentioned Trump by name eight times in his victory speech, pledging to stand up for immigrants and unions.\n\n* Sherrill made opposing Trump a centerpiece of her campaign, seizing on the president's announcement that his administration had \"terminated\" construction on a $16 billion tunnel connecting New Jersey and New York meant to help her state's commuters.\n\n* Spanberger's big margins came in large part from Washington suburbs that have been hugely affected by the government shutdown.\n\nThat said, political observers (and Trump himself) noted that Republican turnout was most likely lower in part because the president himself wasn't on the ballot. Trump also suggested that the shutdown, having entered a record 36th day, weighed on voters.\n\nAffordability was a common theme. The higher cost of everyday life -- including rent, electricity and groceries -- was a message shared by Mamdani, Sherrill and Spanberger, Politico notes.\n\nDemocratic Party officials see it as a potentially winning message against Republicans in midterms next year, hoping to link the costs of Trump's trade war and other policies to voters' fears about their pocketbooks.\n\nThe California win may also bolster Newsom's prospects for a presidential run. The governor, who raised more than $100 million in support of Proposition 50 from backers including the billionaires Reed Hastings, Michael Moritz and George Soros, has emerged as a leading standard-bearer for Democrats.\n\nPrediction markets again nailed the results. Bettors on Kalshi and Polymarket on Tuesday wagered heavily on Democratic wins, even as some polls had suggested tight races in New Jersey and Virginia.\n\nLast night's results will probably further bolster the sites' reputations as mostly reliable political predictors.\n\nHERE'S WHAT'S HAPPENING\n\nInvestor jitters hit Big Tech and crypto. Markets in Asia and Europe were down on Wednesday, as were futures in the tech-heavy Nasdaq, amid worries about sky-high valuations for artificial intelligence-related stocks. A sell-off in chip companies including Samsung Electronics, Advantest and TSMC -- all suppliers to Nvidia -- wiped out $500 billion in combined market value, while shares in SoftBank, which has bet heavily on A.I., fell 10 percent. Crypto also plunged, with Bitcoin dropping below $100,000 on Tuesday for the first time since June.\n\nThe Trump administration nears deals with makers of obesity drugs. Federal officials have been negotiating with Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk to sell doses of some of their obesity drugs on TrumpRx.gov for $149 a month, The Wall Street Journal reports, with an announcement set for Thursday if deals are reached. Novo Nordisk on Wednesday lowered its growth outlook for the year, citing price competition. Separately, Novo Nordisk and Pfizer raised their bids for the weight-loss drug developer Metsera.\n\nJPMorgan Chase says it's being investigated over debanking claims. The bank disclosed in a regulatory filing that it was answering inquiries from government officials and others after President Trump ordered banking regulators to review cases in which banks were accused of discriminating against conservative customers. Trump has accused both JPMorgan and Bank of America of refusing his business after his defense of those who attacked the Capitol in 2021.\n\nAn Elon Musk ally is nominated again to run NASA. Trump renamed Jared Isaacman to lead the space agency after pulling his nomination in June after the president had a falling-out with Musk. Isaacman, a billionaire entrepreneur who led two private missions to orbit on rockets from SpaceX, has contributed to Democratic candidates, which reportedly also upset Trump.\n\nBusiness leaders respond to Mamdani's win\n\nWall Street spent millions in a failed effort to derail Zohran Mamdani's rise to power.\n\nNow that the 34-year-old democratic socialist has been elected New York's youngest mayor in more than a century, many of the city's business leaders are bracing for what's next.\n\nThe reaction falls into three camps:\n\nKeep up the fight: Many on Wall Street view Mamdani's progressive politics -- including taxing the rich and big corporations -- as bad for business. Others fear that Mamdani's past criticism of the city's police will negatively affect public safety, making it harder for businesses to recruit and maintain staff in the city.\n\nSome states are watching the potential fallout. The Florida Council of 100, a pro-business group, is set to release a statement on Wednesday, a draft of which was viewed by The Times. The statement targeted to New York executives by promoting the state's \"pro-growth environment and a commitment to opportunity.\"\n\n(Mamdani's criticism of the Israeli government and the prospect of landing on President Trump's enemies list are also chief worries.)\n\nSome are turning their attention to Albany. \"Guys like me are definitely seriously considering\" lobbying state lawmakers to limit the Mamdani agenda, David Modiano, a managing director at Thales Capital, told The Times.\n\nOthers vow to oppose single issues, like Mamdani's plan to open city-run grocery stores. \"Just because he campaigned on it doesn't mean he'll be able to implement it,\" David Schwartz, the director of the New York Association of Grocery Stores, told Reuters.\n\nSound the alarms: Some real estate executives say Mamdani's rent-freeze plan could backfire. \"You're just going to have a lot less attraction of people to build the housing that we need, which Zohran acknowledges that we need so desperately,\" Kenny Burgos, the C.E.O. of the New York Apartment Association, a trade group that represents building owners and managers, told Fox Business.\n\nExtend an olive branch: Several business leaders had warned that a Mamdani win would lead to an exodus of the city's wealthy to lower-tax states, but those predictions have quieted recently. The mood seemed to improve after several prominent New Yorkers, including Jamie Dimon and Mike Bloomberg, spoke with Mamdani in the final weeks of the campaign to discuss the city's most pressing issues.\n\nSince then, Jane Fraser, the C.E.O. of Citigroup, the billionaire crypto investor Mike Novogratz and Ralph Schlosstein, a co-founder of BlackRock, are among those who have thrown tacit support behind Mamdani, according to Bloomberg. \"I do care deeply about the city, and I'm not going anywhere, whoever the mayor is. I'm going to do whatever I can to help be successful,\" Schlosstein said.\n\nEven Bill Ackman, a fierce Mamdani critic who helped bankroll Andrew Cuomo's failed mayoral bid, seems to be throwing in the towel. \"Congrats on the win,\" he wrote on X. \"Now you have a big responsibility. If I can help NYC, just let me know what I can do.\"\n\n\"Today's first-time buyers are building less housing wealth and will likely have fewer moves over a lifetime as a result.\"\n\n-- Jessica Lautz, an economist for the National Association of Realtors, on a potentially momentous new development: The median age of first-time American house buyers has hit 40, as younger people are increasingly priced out of the market. The trade group has called on lawmakers to adopt policies to bolster housing supply and bring costs down.\n\nMamdani's other tax gambit\n\nZohran Mamdani won on a promise to combat New York's rising cost of living by providing more affordable housing, fast and free buses and universal child care. Funding that agenda rests on taxing the wealthiest New Yorkers and the largest corporations.\n\nA lot of attention has gone to Mamdani's plan to raise taxes 2 percent on New Yorkers making more than $1 million a year. Niko Gallogly has the run down on the other half of his plan: raising New York's corporate tax rate to 11.5 percent.\n\nFirst, some context:\n\n* New York's 7.25 percent corporate tax rate is already the 17th highest in the nation. Some corporate taxes in the state are higher than in all neighboring states and other major states like California and Illinois. Business havens like Nevada and Texas have a 0 percent rate.\n\n* Mamdani's proposed rate hike would tie New York with New Jersey for the highest corporate tax rate in the country.\n\n* Mamdani has argued that President Trump's 2017 tax cuts slashed federal corporate taxes to 21 percent from 35 percent, which would theoretically allow corporations to pay more in state taxes. His campaign estimates the move would generate about $5 billion in annual revenue\n\nExecutives say Mamdani's plan would make New York less competitive. Julie Samuels, the president and C.E.O. of the industry group Tech:NYC, told DealBook that the possibility of higher corporate taxes was raising \"a lot of concern across business leaders.\"\n\nWhile companies are unlikely to flee en masse if the proposal becomes policy, the departure of some New York firms during the pandemic, including the investment firm Elliott Investment Management, underline the possibility that some may go. Businesses could also respond by growing head count outside Manhattan, where they can pay lower wages and taxes.\n\nUltimately, a corporate tax hike isn't up to Mamdani. The plan requires approval from the State Legislature and Gov. Kathy Hochul, who has said she does not intend to increase taxes, but is up for re-election and faces a primary challenge from the left. For business leaders, \"all eyes will be on Albany,\" Samuels said.\n\nTHE SPEED READ\n\nDeals\n\n* Yum!

        "description": "As voters propelled Democratic candidates to victory in key races across the country Tuesday, four states and one city also decided on whether to pass at least seven key ballot measures.\n\nAccording to the latest projections, Californians green-lit a proposal to adopt a new congressional district map, Texas voted to enshrine parental rights into its constitution and Coloradans elected to levy taxes on the highest earners to fund food programs. Here's what to know about the ballot proposals.\n\nIn this article\n\nCalifornia: Proposition 50 on redistricting\n\nReturn to menu\n\nCalifornia is projected to pass Proposition 50, a new voting map championed by Gov. Gavin Newsom (D), according to the Associated Press.\n\nThe redistricting proposal temporarily overrides California's independent redistricting commission and allows the state to draw new congressional maps that could help Democrats win as many as five new seats. It could also counterbalance President Donald Trump's efforts to redraw district maps in Texas and other Republican-led states.\n\nColorado: Funding for school meals\n\nReturn to menu\n\nVoters in Colorado are projected to vote in favor of Prop MM, according to the AP. The ballot measure seeks to increase state income taxes on individuals earning at least $300,000 annually to help fund nutrition assistance programs.\n\nThe generated revenue would primarily be used to provide free breakfast and lunch to students in participating public schools as part of the state's Healthy School Meals for All program, while any additional funds would go toward the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).\n\nMaine: Photo ID for voting and 'red flag' gun law\n\nReturn to menu\n\nVoters in Maine considered two measures: one on voting ID requirements and another on gun restrictions.\n\nThe AP projected that Maine voted to block Question 1, a proposal that would have added a photo ID requirement for voting and tightened rules on absentee voting.\n\nQuestion 2 is set to pass, however, according to the AP. The \"red flag\" law would allow relatives and law enforcement officials to petition courts to temporarily restrict access to guns and other dangerous weapons for individuals who pose a significant danger to themselves or others. Gov. Janet Mills (D) had opposed the measure, arguing that it would place the burden of seeking a court order on families rather than law enforcement.\n\nNew York City: Proposal to reschedule local elections\n\nReturn to menu\n\nThe AP projected that New York City residents voted to block ballot measure 6, which sought to move local elections from odd-numbered to even-numbered years and bring them into alignment with presidential elections. Proponents argued that the change would have increased voter turnout, but the vote was also nonbinding -- it would require an amendment to the state constitution too.\n\nTexas: Amendments on parental rights and citizenship voting\n\nReturn to menu\n\nTwo key amendments to Texas's state constitution are among the proposals on the ballot projected to pass there, according to the AP.\n\nProposition 15 seeks to enshrine parental rights in the state's constitution, by affirming a parent's right \"to exercise care, custody, and control\" of their child, including making decisions about their upbringing. The issue has arisen as part of debates over parental rights and religious freedom. Critics argued that it was overly vague and could restrict young people's independence.\n\nProposition 16 affirms existing legislation that already requires proof of citizenship to vote in state and local elections, by inserting language banning noncitizens from voting into the state constitution. According to the AP, it is also set to pass. Trump and some Republican lawmakers have sought to prevent noncitizen voting across the nation, even though such cases have historically been rare.",

        "title": "Opinion | Gavin Newsom wasn't on the ballot  --  but Prop 50's passage made him a big winner",
        "description": "By Dan Schnur, former Republican campaign strategist and professor of politics and communications at Berkeley, Pepperdine University and USC\n\nWhile many will focus on Mamdani-mania in New York City and the outcome of high-profile governors races in New Jersey and Virginia, the political event from Tuesday most likely to affect the 2028 presidential election happened on the other side of the country. Passage of California's Proposition 50, the redistricting issue on the state ballot, is poised to provide Democrats with five additional U.S. House seats next year -- helpful in their fight to win back control of Congress -- and to provide a major boost to the presidential prospects of Gov. Gavin Newsom.\n\nThrough his frequent news media appearances and combative social media presence, Newsom has emerged over the past several months as the closest thing the national Democratic Party has to a Trump-slayer, at least right now. But spearheading the fight to counter the presidential-led mid-decade redistricting efforts provided Newsom with a platform that could further enhance his presence as a leader in the 2028 primary field.\n\nAt core, the ballot proposition asked Californians to turn their backs, at least temporarily, on efforts they'd already made to be responsible about redistricting. More than a decade ago, California voters rejected the inherent conflict of interest that allows elected officials of both parties to collude in drawing legislative and congressional boundaries that protect their incumbents from the annoyance of competitive reelection campaigns. In 2008 and 2010, they passed a pair of ballot initiatives that took this power away from the state legislature and granted it to a bipartisan citizens commission.\n\nBut that was a different political era and a much different political landscape. When President Donald Trump encouraged Texas Republicans to redraw their state's congressional districts this summer to protect the GOP's House majority, it created a domino effect: So far, more than a dozen other states have announced plans or taken steps to redraw their own maps. This gradual decline into craven partisanship already affects one-third of the states with more than one congressional district. Ohio became the latest on Friday.\n\nThanks to the two ballot initiatives that Californians passed in a more innocent era, the challenge before Newsom and his allies was to persuade a statewide electorate to reverse their own well-intentioned redistricting reforms. The governor understands his state well enough to know that Californians would be reluctant to undo their own democracy-enhancing handiwork, so he made two savvy political calculations to enhance the prospects for Proposition 50.\n\nThe first was to draft his measure as a temporary suspension that would allow the citizens commission to be back in charge of the regularly scheduled 2030 redistricting -- a point when the specter of Trump presumably will no longer loom. Newsom's second stratagem was to recast a debate over the arcane topic of congressional line-drawing into a fight that deep-blue California would lead against a president the vast majority of the state's voters had opposed in three consecutive presidential elections.\n\nWhile Prop 50 enjoys a sizable lead in the final round of preelection polling, things weren't always so certain. When the redistricting skirmishes began in August, an Emerson College statewide poll showed that one-third of California voters supported the effort, a quarter opposed it and 42% were undecided. But support for the measure grew rapidly after Newsom's immense fundraising efforts created a one-sided debate on Golden State airwaves and screens.\n\nThe anti-Trump clarion significantly heightened Newsom's national profile and allowed him to dramatically enlarge his financial support from out-of-state small donors. Both stand to be of immense benefit in the next presidential election, but in the immediate term, they provided an overwhelming fundraising advantage for the Proposition 50 campaign. In what may be a political first, Newsom actually asked his donors to stop giving money to the campaign, since there was nothing left on which to spend.\n\nNational Republicans had vowed to match the $100 million-plus that Newsom and his allies had pledged to raise, but after the campaign began, they apparently decided that they would rather direct that money to competitive House races around the country next year than risk it on an all-or-nothing initiative fight in a strongly hostile Golden State. They ultimately came through with only a tiny portion of that sum. That left California megadonor and activist Charles Munger Jr. and former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger -- who led the drive for the original reforms and are Prop 50's most high-profile opponents today -- to fight a lonely battle without the national support they had been promised.\n\nTuesday's result is poised to leave the GOP with as few as four U.S. House seats in a 52-member state delegation. California's Republican Party has been a nonfactor for many years, although its legislative leaders have recently achieved some gains by teaming with centrist Democrats on public safety and energy policy. Most state conservatives focus their attention on either national politics or local and legislative campaigns in their remaining bastions of influence. With the passage of Prop 50, their minuscule role in state politics will diminish even further.\n\nNewsom, on the other hand, is just getting started. A Prop 50 victory is not nearly enough to guarantee him the Democratic presidential nomination, but it should give him a seat at the primary table if he so desires -- which he certainly appears to.",

        "description": "In today's edition ... A massive night for Democrats ... It's still the economy, stupid ... California responds to Texas on redistricting ... but first ...\n\nThe big news\n\nHere's what happened in last night's elections.\n\nThe big takeaway: Voters delivered significant wins to Democrats nationwide last night, putting Republicans on the defensive a year after the nation elected President Donald Trump.\n\nVirginia: Democrats swept. Abigail Spanberger won the governorship, Ghazala Hashmi the lieutenant governorship and Jay Jones the attorney general's office. Democrats also flipped over a dozen seats in the House of Delegates, expanding their majority to at least 61 seats in the 100-seat body with more races still to be called. It was one of the most successful nights for Democrats in the commonwealth's history.\n\nNew Jersey: Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill won the governorship, beating former state assemblyman Jack Ciattarelli. Sherrill's running mate, Dale Caldwell, will be lieutenant governor; New Jersey's governor appoints the attorney general.\n\nNew York: Democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani won the mayor race, beating former Democratic governor Andrew M. Cuomo and Republican Curtis Sliwa.\n\nCalifornia: Proposition 50, which would allow the adoption of a new congressional map that could add five more Democratic House seats, passed.\n\n'It's affordability, stupid'\n\nNew York's mayor-elect, Zohran Mamdani, shares few similarities with Virginia's governor-elect, Abigail Spanberger, and New Jersey's governor-elect, Mikie Sherrill.\n\nYes, they were all Democratic nominees. But Mamdani, a 34-year-old immigrant who on Tuesday won New York City's mayoral contest, is a proud democratic socialist who ran a progressive campaign that championed freezing certain rents, instituting free bus fares and creating a network of city-owned grocery stores. Spanberger, a 46-year-old mother of three and former CIA officer, and Sherrill, a 53-year-old mother of four and former U.S. Navy helicopter pilot, both embraced a more centrist view that focused on countering Trump's second-term actions, curbing inflation and lowering household costs.\n\nAnd yet, there was one through line that connected all three winning campaigns: affordability.\n\n\"You all chose leadership that will focus relentlessly on what matters most: Lowering costs, keeping our communities safe and strengthening our economy for every Virginian,\" Spanberger said at her raucous election-night event.\n\n\"I'm determined to build prosperity for all of our citizens, and I've heard from thousands of you about what liberty and prosperity mean to you, what it's going to take for your family to thrive,\" Sherrill said during her victory speech before vowing to declare a state of emergency to halt increases on energy costs.\n\n\"Central to [our] vision will be the most ambitious agenda to tackle the cost of living crisis that this city has seen since the days of Fiorello La Guardia,\" Mamdani said, describing his victory as \"a mandate for a city we can afford.\"\n\nThe trio approached the issue from different ideological perspectives, but they each centered their campaigns on making life more affordable. That focus, Democrats told us, comes from a lesson learned during the 2024 presidential campaign, when the party struggled mightily to respond to voters' cost-of-living concerns. And the candidates' focus on affordability could provide a road map for a range of Democratic candidates in next year's key races.\n\n\"The top issue across the country is affordability. We saw it last cycle. We see it now. And I think it continues to be a top theme as we head into 2026,\" said Rep. Suzan DelBene, chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. \"Costs are going up and folks want [members of Congress] to focus on lowering costs and helping families. ... So [it's] absolutely a big issue and only becoming a bigger issue.\"\n\nRepublicans have signaled they plan to use Mamdani against Democrats in future elections, arguing that his democratic socialism represents mainstream Democratic ideology. Already working to counter that narrative, DelBene noted that the House map next year will be \"decided in purple districts across the country\" that are notably different from New York. And, she argued, voters \"in places like Iowa, Nebraska or Arizona, are focused on the cost of living, the needs that they have in their communities ... not who the mayor of New York is.\"\n\nThere is some irony here. Trump was successful in talking about the economy in 2024, lambasting Biden's record as Democrats struggled to convince voters that the economy was actually better than they thought. That disconnect is seen as a key reason Trump defeated Vice President Kamala Harris and Republicans won control of the Senate while retaining control of the House.\n\nSince that election, inflation has remained a persistent issue. Everything from utility costs to grocery prices have jumped over the last year and voters aren't just taking note -- they are blaming Trump. A Washington Post-ABC News-Ipsos poll released on Tuesday found that roughly 6 in 10 Americans blame Trump \"a great deal\" or \"a good amount\" for price increases, with 62 percent disapproving of his handling of the economy.\n\nTrump has been in denial about voters' economic concerns. The president regularly says, \"The economy is unbelievable,\" and \"prices are down.\" And when pressed by \"60 Minutes\" recently about rising grocery prices, he said, \"No, you are wrong.\"\n\nThe 2024 \"election has forced Democrats to confront the fact that we lost trust with voters and lost focus for a bit on some core issues, and Republicans hit us over the head with that,\" said Dan Kanninen, the battleground state director for Harris's presidential campaign. \"But now we are all seeing the same thing happen to Republicans. They talked a big game on costs in 2024, but have done absolutely nothing to address costs.\"\n\nReflecting on when James Carville coined \"It's the economy, stupid\" during the 1992 presidential campaign, as a reminder of the importance of cost-of-living issues at that time, Kanninen added: \"It's now more apt to say it's affordability, stupid. ... It's been clarifying for our party to get back to that home base of costs and connecting with voters.\"\n\nThe disconnect between Republicans' successful economic messaging in 2024 and their failed messaging a year later was most apparent in Virginia's gubernatorial race, where Lieutenant Governor Winsome Earle-Sears struggled to discuss economic issues, and instead focused much of her time and money talking about transgender rights and schools.\n\n\"The Sears strategy in this campaign has been totally mystifying to me,\" Bill Bolling, the former Republican lieutenant governor of Virginia, said shortly before Election Day. \"All the polling data says the issues on the top of Virginians' minds are jobs, the economy, and the cost of living.\"\n\nJesse Ferguson, a Democratic operative from Virginia, argued that Earle-Sears -- and Republicans writ large -- fell into the same trap that Democrats did in 2024: Telling voters not to believe what they were actually feeling on the economy.\n\n\"They didn't talk about labels and factions, they talked about prices, paychecks and power bills,\" Ferguson said of Spanberger, Sherrill and Mamdani. \"That's what cut through the noise.\"\n\nIn New York, it often seemed that no matter what question Mamdani was asked, he found a way to pivot to talking about the cost of living in America's largest city.\n\nThis was maybe never clearer than when Mamdani, days before Election Day, was asked about Trump telling \"60 Minutes\" that he was a \"much better looking person than him.\"\n\n\"My focus is on the cost-of-living crisis, man,\" Mamdani said, laughing as he walked away.\n\nWhat we're watching\n\nCalifornia's Proposition 50 should give Democrats five more safe congressional seats, countering the five new red districts created by Texas's legislature earlier this year.\n\nAs we talked about earlier this week, many other states are eyeing redistricting efforts. So far, GOP lawmakers in Missouri and North Carolina have each created one more Republican seat. Indiana's Republican governor, Mike Braun, called a special legislative session to draw more Republican districts. Virginia has also initiated a redistricting push to favor Democrats, which the party can now continue after securing a majority in the House of Delegates last night.\n\nMaryland became the latest blue state to join the trend when Gov. Wes Moore kicked off a redistricting process to get rid of the state's sole Republican district yesterday, despite fierce opposition from some of his fellow Maryland Democrats.\n\nDemocrats are confident no matter how Republicans gerrymander red states, they will still have the advantage in the 2026 midterms.\n\nThe party that doesn't control the White House has historically won the popular vote nationwide in midterm House elections by 4.5 percentage points. The House Majority PAC, the super PAC affiliated with House Democratic leadership, sent out a memo today predicting a double-digit net -- allowing them to take back the House -- even if all GOP gerrymandering efforts succeed, assuming historical trends hold up.\n\nNational Republican Congressional Committee Chair Richard Hudson said his party will work to win whatever new districts are drawn in California.\n\n\"Even under this new map, Republicans have clear opportunities to flip seats because Californians are fed up with Democrat chaos,\" he said in a statement. \"We will continue to compete and win because our candidates are stronger, our message is resonating, and Californians are tired of being ignored.\"\n\nFor a related read, check out Maeve Reston's account of how Gov. Gavin Newsom got Prop 50 across the finish line.\n\nGet ready with The Post\n\nIn memoriam\n\nFormer Vice President Dick Cheney is dead. He was 84.\n\nCheney was perhaps the most powerful vice president in American history, profoundly shaping the country's response to terrorism in the aftermath of 9/11. He ordered the use of \"any means at our disposal\" to eliminate terrorists, and ignored legal prohibitions on torture and domestic surveillance. He was also deeply involved in President George W. Bush's domestic policy, advocating for a strong executive and free market.\n\nThough a pillar of the Republican Party while in office, he became a fierce critic of Trump in retirement. He defended his daughter, former representative Liz Cheney, who was one of two Republicans on the House committee that investigated the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, from GOP vitriol. He endorsed Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election, saying at the time \"there has never been an individual who is a greater threat to our republic than Donald Trump.\"\n\nRead Barton Gellman and Marc Fisher's masterful obituary for the former vice president. And Karen Tumulty reflected on how Cheney lived most of his life as a Republican insider, but died on the outside.\n\nIn your local paper\n\nPortland Press Herald: Maine voters voted down a referendum that would have required photo ID to vote in elections and restricted access to absentee voting.\n\nThe Philadelphia Inquirer: All three justices of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court up for a retention vote won their elections.\n\nMinnesota Star Tribune: Minneapolis went to bed last night not knowing who their next mayor will be, as none of the candidates won a majority of first-choice votes. Second-choice votes will be counted today.\n\nSend a reply\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the election results? Any surprises?

        "title": "Here's what CBS News exit polls told us about the 2025 elections",
        "description": "He may not have been on the ballot, but President Trump was on the minds of voters in the 2025 elections.\n\nHe was a factor for many voters in each of the places where exit polls were conducted: Virginia, New Jersey, New York City and California. And more said their vote in these races was to oppose him, than support him.\n\nThese are historically Democrat-leaning places, and more voters here disapproved than approved of his overall job as president. They also found that his administration's actions on immigration enforcement have gone too far.\n\nNew York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani won a decisive victory over former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo on a campaign of affordability, and the cost of living was the most important issue to voters in New York City. Mamdani handily won the majority of voters who picked it. More specifically, he focused on the cost of housing, which seven in 10 voters in New York said was a major problem where they live, and he won among renters, who made up more than half of the electorate.\n\nVoters who made up their minds in the last month of the campaign voted overwhelmingly for Cuomo, but it wasn't enough to make up for the majority of voters who decided on Mamdani before October.\n\nCuomo led Mamdani among Jewish voters -- most of whom said a candidate's position on Israel was important in their vote.\n\nMamdani's coalition was led by enormous support among voters under 30 and very liberal voters, but his support extended to all voters under 45 and to those who considered themselves only somewhat liberal, while older voters, as well as moderates and conservatives, voted for Cuomo.\n\nThe Republican candidate in the New York City mayoral race, Curtis Sliwa, came in a distant third and didn't even win self-identified Republicans (they voted for Cuomo). Had he dropped out of the race, it might not have made a difference. Though most of Sliwa's supporters said they would have voted for Cuomo, exit polls indicate that in a hypothetical two-way race, Mamdani still would have been victorious.\n\nMamdani also ran on change, and that was picked as the most important quality in how voters made their decision. A changing electorate was also a hallmark of Mamdani's win -- his strongest support was not just young voters, but also those who were voting in a mayoral race for the first time and those who had moved to New York within the past 10 years.\n\nEconomic issues also loomed large in the Democratic wins in the gubernatorial races in New Jersey and Virginia. In New Jersey, Jack Ciattarelli won voters who were most concerned about taxes and who said electricity was a major problem for them, but voters who said the most important issue was the economy overall voted for Sherrill. In Virginia, those \"economy\" voters voted for Abigail Spanberger over Winsome Earle-Sears by more than 20 points.\n\nWomen voted in big numbers for the women Democratic candidates in Virginia and New Jersey. Sherrill and Spanberger's margins with women were far larger than Kamala Harris' were nationally in 2024.\n\nIndependents were key, too. They swung toward Spanberger in Virginia, after Glenn Youngkin won them in 2021. Independents also backed Sherrill in New Jersey.\n\nThe proposition, pushed by Gov. Gavin Newsom, authorizes temporary changes to the state's congressional district maps in response to redistricting in Texas.\n\n\"Yes\" voters didn't necessarily think this ballot initiative was the best way to draw congressional district line -- but they overwhelmingly said it was to counter the changes made by Republicans in other states.",

        "title": "A Big Win in California Propels Newsom",
        "description": "At a time when Democrats have been searching for a win against President Trump, Gov. Gavin Newsom of California gave them one.\n\nCalifornia voters on Tuesday overwhelmingly supported Proposition 50, Mr. Newsom's measure to create more Democratic congressional seats, countering a similar redistricting effort pushed by Mr. Trump in other states to protect Republican control of the House next year.\n\nThe result has sharply lifted Mr. Newsom's political profile at a moment when he is considering running for president. And it has provided what many Democrats praised as a road map on how to fight for a party that remains adrift one year after Mr. Trump captured the White House.\n\n\"It shows that he can get stuff done,\" said the chairwoman of the South Carolina Democratic Party, Christale Spain, who hosted Mr. Newsom on a swing through her state in July. She added, \"Democrats want somebody to fight back. He's pushing back and fighting back. That is what is helping him break through.\"\n\nThe election has now freed Mr. Newsom, whose term as governor ends in January 2027, to turn his attention to elevating his presence on the national stage, presenting himself as a leader who scored a high-profile electoral win for Democrats at a bleak moment for the party.\n\nHe is planning to travel the country campaigning on behalf of Democratic congressional candidates. He has a forthcoming memoir to promote. And aides said he is likely to soon pivot to the issue of climate change and cast himself as a climate champion, drawing a contrast with Mr. Trump and his supporters.\n\nThe California results capped an evening of coast-to-coast victories by Democrats, including contests for mayor of New York, governor of Virginia and governor of New Jersey.\n\nThe outcome in California was never preordained. Mr. Newsom took a political risk: He was essentially asking voters to overturn, albeit temporarily, a measure they had passed 15 years ago requiring a nonpartisan commission to draw congressional district lines. He faced opposition from governmental reform groups and Arnold Schwarzenegger, the former governor who had championed that initiative that created the commission. By the end, the opposition had walked off the field and Mr. Newsom's win was so decisive that the race was called as soon as polls closed.\n\nMr. Newsom was in the carriage house of the governor's mansion at that moment, watching returns with about two dozen friends and aides. A big cheer erupted as soon as CNN called the race in his favor, one of his aides said, and then Mr. Newsom headed for the California Democratic Party headquarters, where he addressed news cameras with a somber tone that lacked the typical election night celebrations.\n\nStanding between an American flag and a California flag, Mr. Newsom cast the result as a repudiation of Mr. Trump and a victory for Democrats in California and across the nation.\n\n\"What a night for the Democratic Party -- a party that is in its ascendancy, a party that's on its toes, no longer on its heels,\" the governor said.\n\nThe result marks a decided turn in Mr. Newsom's fortunes. Just 18 months ago, he seemed in danger of being overshadowed by another California Democrat and sometimes-rival, Kamala Harris, the former vice president who had become the Democratic candidate for president after Joseph R. Biden Jr. dropped out of the race.\n\nHe was being disparaged by many leaders on the left for using his podcast to embrace and interview conservative supporters of Mr. Trump, including Charlie Kirk and Steve Bannon. He struck an initially conciliatory stance toward Mr. Trump, again roiling many in his party, going to the airport in Los Angeles to warmly greet the president on the tarmac when he flew there earlier this year to inspect the damage after devastating wildfires.\n\nBut Mr. Newsom began to methodically reposition himself this summer, after Mr. Trump took control of California's National Guard and sent troops into Los Angeles. He began using social media to mimic and mock the president, in the process drawing approval from the left. His championing of Proposition 50 was the highest-profile evidence of his shift.\n\n\"Six months ago, the strategy was to engage with MAGA leaders like Steve Bannon,\" said Eric Jaye, a Democratic consultant in San Francisco who was an adviser to Mr. Newsom when he was mayor of San Francisco. \"With the Proposition 50 victory, Newsom has made himself Donald Trump's chief, and most successful, antagonist, and that is exactly what Democratic primary voters are looking for nationally.\"\n\nThe road ahead is far from easy if he seeks the presidency.\n\nEven his allies say he carries significant political baggage. He's a product of arguably the most liberal state in the country and a promoter of policies that are seen as out-of-touch with many voters. He has a personal style that at least some of his critics argue is slick and off-putting. And the backlash he generated following one incident during the pandemic has never fully subsided. Mr. Newsom attended a birthday dinner for a lobbyist-friend at The French Laundry, one of the most expensive restaurants in the world, and was photographed not wearing a mask, at a moment when he was telling Californians not to gather with their families for Thanksgiving.\n\nThis is a difficult time for California -- struggling with the aftermath of the fires, a housing crisis and what many Republicans denounce as out of control spending -- all of which Mr. Newsom's opponents would seek to have him own in any presidential campaign.\n\nAnd even though voters approved Mr. Newsom's redistricting measure, it could prove for naught if Republicans manage to hold on to the House, dimming the relevance of the victory on Tuesday.\n\n\"While it's a very important win for him politically, this is just the first step,\" said Brian Brokaw, a Democratic strategist who advises Mr. Newsom. \"Doing what he can to make sure that Democrats win those seats and take back the majority in the midterms will be just as important. Without that, Proposition 50 will have been just a blip along the way.\"\n\nAnd Republicans have already made clear that no matter Mr. Newsom's victory with Proposition 50, they would try to diminish his standing in California and nationally, and seek to derail his attempt to stake out a spot on the presidential stage.\n\n\"Gavin Newsom wants to be president, but before chasing his next job, he's got 12 months left to try and clean up the mess he made in California,\" said Steve Hilton, a Republican and former Fox News host who's running for governor. \"Instead of running the state he's been trying to rig our elections.\"\n\nStill, it's hard to recall a time when Mr. Newsom appeared in such a commanding political position. He raised $114 million for the redistricting campaign, including $38 million from supporters responding to text and email appeals, assembling the kind of small donor list that could prove critical in a presidential race. Much of that money came from outside California.\n\nThe result came not only at a pivotal time for Mr. Newsom but for his party, which believes it has a chance to win back Congress from Republicans. The new lines are expected to help Democrats win as many as five House seats now held by Republicans in California.\n\nOn Tuesday night, Mr. Newsom spoke solemnly about a nation struggling through perilous times, in a speech that suggested the themes he will no doubt strike again in the coming months.\n\n\"I hope it's dawning on people, the sobriety of this moment -- what's at stake,\" he said.",

        "title": "'We sent a message.' 5 takeaways from Democrats' 2025 elections sweep",
        "description": "Here are three reasons the 2025 elections could shift the balance of power and influence key players in both parties.\n\nDonald Trump received a rebuke as Democrats swept every major contest on Nov. 4, which they hope foretells a nationwide backlash to Republican control in Washington ahead of the pivotal 2026 midterm elections.\n\nThe results represent the first judgment of Trump's return to power by millions of Americans as the lame-duck GOP president's approval numbers sag amid the longest federal government shutdown in U.S. history.\n\nDemocrats and their allies, who have been locked out of power in Washington since January, scored expected wins with former Rep. Abigail Spanberger and New York Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani, a socialist-aligned candidate, coasting to victory in the Virginia governor's and New York City mayoral races, respectively.\n\nDemocrats also won the New Jersey governorship, where Rep. Mikie Sherrill decisively defeated Republican businessman Jack Ciattarelli, in a race that had been a dead heat in public polls.\n\n\"Congratulations to all the Democratic candidates who won tonight,\" former President Barack Obama, who hit the 2025 campaign trail in both states during the final days, said in an Nov. 4 post on X.\n\n\"It's a reminder that when we come together around strong, forward-looking leaders who care about the issues that matter, we can win. We've still got plenty of work to do, but the future looks a little bit brighter.\"\n\nIn California, the Proposition 50 ballot measure, pushed by Gov. Gavin Newsom, thrust Democrats headfirst into the country's escalating redistricting wars, which Republicans started by redrawing maps in Texas and other GOP-controlled states, at Trump's behest, to increase the number of Republican-leaning congressioal seats. The Golden State ballot measure, which passed, will allow state leaders to temporarily bypass an independent redistricting commission and draw a new congressional map that will offset some of those Republican gains.\n\nConservatives who back the president downplayed the results by noting they occurred in four blue states that Trump had lost in the prior year.\n\nHere's a look a the 2025 election results, and what they mean for both sides in the moment and beyond.\n\nAfter tough year, Dems get a big night\n\nFor a year, Democrats have needed reason for hope and they got the boost they wanted in the 2025 off-year elections.\n\nVirginia and New Jersey lean Democratic, with former Vice President Kamala Harris carrying both in the 2024 election despite her loss nationally. Yet the two victorious Democrats - Spanberger in Virginia and Sherrill in New Jersey - both won by double digits and by greater margins than Harris did a year ago.\n\nBoth women - Spanberger, a former congresswoman and Sherrill, a current member of Congress - ran centrist campaigns that re-established Democrats' strength in suburbs that are critical to their success in 2026.\n\n\"We sent a message to the whole world that in 2025, Virginia chose pragmatism over partisanship,\" Spanberger, who became the first woman elected to lead the commonwealth, said in her victory speech from Richmond, Virginia.\n\n\"We chose our commonwealth over chaos.\"\n\nEven in contests where Democrats were on the ropes, such as the Virginia race for attorney general, Democrat Jay Jones secured a win, according to NBC and Fox, overcoming a text message scandal that threatened his chances.\n\nDays before the election, polls showed him locked in a dead heat with Republican incumbent Jason Miyares, who Trump endorsed.\n\nDemocrats also maintained control of the state Supreme Court in Pennsylvania, a critical swing state in the 2028 presidential election, as voters retained all three Democratic justices up for reelection. And the party flipped two Public Service Commission seats in Georgia Tuesday night, the first time Democrats have held statewide non-federal seats since 2006.\n\nThese outcomes mark a yearlong quest by Democrats to retrieve their mojo after a bruising loss in last year's presidential election, but surveys show voters are not fully sold on the opposition party's comeback narrative.\n\nA Washington Post/ABC News poll that found Trump's disapproval rating at 59% revealed more than two-thirds of voters believe Democrats remain \"out of touch\" with Americans. Roughly 68% of respondents in the poll concur that Democrats don't get the concerns of most people, which is worse than the 63% who say the same about Trump and the 61% who say the same about the GOP.\n\nMAGA agenda meets the voters without Trump\n\nThe MAGA euphoria surrounding Trump's second term faced a reality check in the first big round of voting since the president won in 2024, with signs that the president is overreaching and courting backlash in the midterms.\n\nTrump already was facing an uphill climb in the midterms, which historically favor the party out of power. He blamed GOP election loses on the government shutdown and the fact that he wasn't on the ballot in his first comments after key races were called.\n\n\"TRUMP WASN'T ON THE BALLOT, AND SHUTDOWN, WERE THE TWO REASONS THAT REPUBLICANS LOST ELECTIONS TONIGHT,\" according to Pollsters,\" Trump wrote on social media.\n\nBut the GOP's loses add to the growing momentum among Democrats eager to push back against a president who has tested the limits of executive power.\n\nWhile Trump's moves have thrilled his supporters, they appeared to be a liability for Republican candidates running statewide in Virginia and New Jersey. The president never endorsed Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears in the Virginia governor's race directly, but his policies, specifically cuts made by the Department of Government Efficiency, hung over the race.\n\nBetween January and May roughly 22,100 people in Virginia lost their jobs after DOGE axed larger swaths of the federal bureaucracy, according to Federal Reserve data.\n\nMamdani rides affordability, socialist wave to declare 'mandate'\n\nMamdani left little doubt in the New York City mayor's race, winning by a comfortable margin despite much of the city's political and business establishment trying to beat him.\n\n\"You have delivered a mandate for a new kind of politics, a mandate for a city we can afford and a mandate for a government that delivers exactly that,\" he said during his Nov. 4 victory speech.\n\nHe overcame weeks of attacks that he's too young, too inexperienced and too far to the left to cruise past his chief rival, former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, 67, a longtime Democrat who ran as an independent after losing in the primary.\n\nPolitical consultant Suri Kasirer told USA TODAY the mayor's race \"was a change election,\" noting record voter turnout and Mamdani's grassroots campaign and online engagement.\n\nMamdani's sizable victory - finishing with about 50% of the vote Mamdani's sizable victory - immediately catapults the 34-year-old democratic socialist into the national spotlight. He campaigned on an economic populist message centered on affordability, with proposals such as free city buses and government-subsidized grocery stores.\n\n\"He is a bright light showing the future path for championing working families in New York,\" said Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., a fellow member of the Democratic Socialists of America and a rumored 2028 presidential contender. \"I know for Zohran, it's not about Democrat, Republican, or independent, it's about how we help people.\"\n\nDemocrats see different paths forward\n\nThe race to lead the Big Apple drew more than 2 million voters, the highest turnout New York City has seen for a mayoral election in more than three decades. It ended the Democratic Cuomo dynasty, as the second-generation governor tried to coalesce support of moderate Democrats and Republicans to defeat Mamdani but couldn't get quite enough of them.\n\nCuomo had an unlikely ally in Trump, who on the eve of the election endorsed Cuomo in a last-ditch effort to try to defeat Mamdani. Trump, a native of New York City, mocked Mamdani relentlessly, wrongly labelling the democratic socialists a \"communist\" and calling him a \"total nut job.\"\n\nMamdani, who is now set to be the first Muslim mayor and first Asian American mayor of the nation's largest city, faces a showdown with Trump. For months, Trump has threatened to withhold federal funds from New York under a Mamdani mayorship, predicting this summer that he would \"have a lot of fun with him\" if he were elected.\n\nEven many Democrats acknowledge Mamdani's political formula that has excited a new generation of progressives might not work in the suburbs and other swing districts that the party will need to carry in two years in the 2026 midterm elections.\n\nSherrill and Spanberger won by larger margins than Mamdani, and did so by presenting themselves as pragmatists rather than radicals.\n\nSpanberger pounded federal worker layoffs into the minds of voters on the campaign trail along with the ongoing government shutdown, cost of living concerns, her bipartisan record in Congress and past military service. She also leaned heavily into reproductive rights, which was a major issue for Old Dominion State voters given it is set to weigh a constitutional amendment to protect abortion rights.\n\nPolitical observers noted that paid off with voters, saying the former congresswoman and CIA officer performed better among non-college graduates than the previous Democratic contender, former Gov. Terry McAuliffe, and did better than Harris did last year in key areas of the state, such as Loudoun County, a suburb of Washington, D.C.\n\nNewsom scores decisive Democratic win in redistricting wars\n\nOf all the Nov. 4 results, Gov. Gavin Newsom's ballot initiative aimed at slashing Republican congressional seats was set up as a one-on-one heavyweight bout against President Donald Trump, who has been relentless in pressuring GOP-led legislatures to redraw their congressional maps.\n\nProposition 50 is the unofficial start to both the midterms but also the 2028 contest because it is viewed as setting up the 58-year-old Newsom's presidential bid after a year trying to distinguish himself from other White House hopefuls.\n\nThe initial results show the side favoring Proposition 50 winning the night by a 64-to-35 margin with about 60% of the vote counted, which gives Democratic legislator the pathway to create five new seats out of California that would be in their favor. This gives the national party hopes for potentially winning back control of the U.S. House of Representatives, which would be a major setback for the Trump administration.\n\n\"What a night for the Democratic Party,\" Newsom said during a Nov. 4 press conference. \"A party that is in its ascendancy; a party that's on its toes, no longer on its heels... but it was not just a victory tonight for the Democratic Party, it was victory for the United States and the people of this country.\"\n\nThe governor's advisors were open with USA TODAY that this ballot initiative adds \"momentum\" to Newsom's presidential pitch in 2028, as he is eyeing a presidential campaign announcement soon after the midterms results, according to CBS News.\n\nIf he's seen as an architect of the party taking back a part of Congress that could put other rivals on their heels as they look for ways in the coming months to be distinguished by voters.\n\nOther Democratic state leaders who are following Newsom into the trenches of an escalating redistricting war. The Virginia legislature passed a measure in October redrawing its 11 congressional districts maps via a constitutional amendment that aims to adding two or three Democratic-held seats.\n\nMaryland Gov. Wes Moore announced a new panel on Nov. 4 that will consider redistricting too, adding: \"Trump and his allies are trying to rig the system\" ahead of the midterms. It is a move that stands in direct opposition to fellow Democrat Bill Ferguson, the Maryland state Senate president, who said he is against the idea, according to reports.\n\nIn a Nov. 4 post on Truth Social, Trump alleged without evidence - and implausibly, given California's Democratic tilt and the polls showing the measure was likely to pass - that the California vote is \"a GIANT SCAM\" which he suggested should be subject to \"legal and criminal review.\"",

        "title": "2028 already? Off-year elections provide crucial test for Trump and the Democrats",
        "description": "Fox News correspondent Bryan Llenas reports on the New Jersey gubernatorial race and President Donald Trump's tele-rally for Republican candidate Jack Ciattarelli on 'Fox News @ Night.'\n\nI hate the fact that I'm writing about 2028. You probably hate it even more.\n\nBut there is a rhythm to off-year elections, and it goes like this:\n\nNew Jersey (very blue) and Virginia (blue-ish) get an enormous amount of attention.\n\nTRUMP LOOMS LARGE OVER KEY ELECTION DAY 2025 CONTESTS DESPITE NOT BEING ON BALLOT\n\nPresident Donald Trump makes news every day, sometimes several times a day, but he has been MIA in terms of in-person campaigning, having decided that the thing stinks and he doesn't want the foul smell associated with him.\n\nLet's face it. Unless you live across the Potomac in Virginia, or down by Norfolk or Newport News, did you have the faintest idea who was running for governor? (It's Abigail Spanberger.)\n\nHere's the irony. They get all this coverage because everyone loves a horse race. But, only two or three national reporters will go back in six months to see how they're faring. Campaigning is exciting, governing is boring. I used to cover state and local officials, so I know whereof I speak.\n\nBy the way, Virginia has a stupid one-term-and-you're-out rule. If people think Republican Glenn Youngkin is doing a good job running the commonwealth, why shouldn't they have a chance to vote for him again? Makes no sense.\n\nDespite his absence from the trail, Trump (who endorsed Andrew Cuomo at the last minute) is the issue in every race -- who can stand up to him, who can blame him for rising prices, the government shutdown and the demolition of the East Wing.\n\nTRUMP MAKES LAST MINUTE PITCH FOR REPUBLICANS ON EVE OF 2025 ELECTIONS\n\nIt's kind of a perfect storm for the Democrats, and the president has made no attempt to meet with them, having assumed that Chuck Schumer and company would cave long before this. Instead, they broke through with a message about soaring premiums for Obamacare, which Trump criticizes but has not proposed his own health care plan in either term.\n\nNext up is the midterms, where I presume the president will go all out. The GOP has avoided some of the crazier nominees of the past (such as Christine O'Donnell, who said gay people have a psychological disorder, lied about her background, and later declared, \"I have dabbled into witchcraft.\")\n\nThe Democrats have a shot at taking control of the House, given the Republicans' razor-thin margin, and that would fundamentally change Trump's final two years. In the Senate, they have virtually no chance.\n\nWhich brings us back to 2028. (I know, I know.) Even if Trump still controls everything, he is deemed a lame duck the day after the midterms. Of course, he'll still dominate the news.\n\nLately, Trump has been talking up his strong bench, mentioning Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio. This undercuts the assumption that the vice president would be his natural heir. They are said to be friends, but Rubio, who holds about nine jobs now, has far more government experience and foreign policy expertise, though he's had to drop some of his previous positions to satisfy the boss. I suspect that Trump -- I've been saying for months he wouldn't run again-will pick the order of the ticket.\n\nTwo months after the midterms, the battle for the Democratic nomination gets under way. It could be Calif. Governor Gavin Newsom, former White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel or AOC, who's more in tune with an increasingly left-wing party, and a bunch of governors you've never heard of.\n\nELECTION DAY POSES EARLY POLITICAL TEST FOR TRUMP AMID LINGERING SHUTDOWN\n\nMuch depends on whether people are burned out on Trumpian chaos by that time, not to mention the state of the economy. Then again, Barack Obama had given one rousing convention speech, but who expected him to beat the Clinton machine and win two terms?\n\nThe white-hot media spotlight will shift to the Democratic contest while checking on the Vance/Rubio pecking order. Trump can make news by snapping his fingers - for instance, after saying he'd restore 50% of the SNAP food program once two judges' rulings he now says he won't fund it at all, as a way of ratcheting up the pressure. He said most of the 42 million people on SNAP are \"largely Democrats,\" then quickly added that party doesn't matter. It's another pressure tactic,\n\nActually, of the 30 states that Trump carried last year, 25 of them are more reliant on food stamps than the national average.\n\nTrump's interview with Norah O'Donnell of CBS, now under new management, drew 13.2 million viewers, the highest rating since days after the Capitol riot.",

        "title": "Bomb threats in New Jersey and Trump warnings for California mark Election Day",
        "description": "Bomb threats to New Jersey polling stations, a voter roll mishap in Pennsylvania potentially affecting thousands of voters and warnings by President Donald Trump against California's mail balloting system marked the final day of voting in an off-year election with several nationally prominent races.\n\nVoting otherwise appeared to go smoothly Tuesday across the U.S., as voters cast ballots in the first significant election since Trump won the White House for a second time.\n\nThey were deciding governor's races in New Jersey and Virginia, a mayor's race in New York, Supreme Court elections in Pennsylvania, and voting and gun control measures in Maine. A redistricting initiative in California that was a response to Trump's push to redraw congressional lines in GOP-controlled states ahead of next year's midterm elections has been of particular interest to the Republican president.\n\nHis Department of Justice sent election monitors to five counties in California, a state Trump has lost three times and whose mail balloting system he has often criticized despite no evidence of any widespread fraud or other voting-related problems. In a post Tuesday on his social media platform, the president called the state's voting process \"RIGGED\" and warned that it was \"under very serious legal and criminal review. STAY TUNED!\"\n\nClaims of election rigging are almost routine for Trump in the run-up to elections and sometimes on the day of voting itself. On Election Day last year, before he was declared the winner, he claimed without providing any details or evidence that there was \"talk about massive cheating in Philadelphia\" and said law enforcement was on the way. He continues to lie about his loss in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom, who has been championing the redistricting initiative, responded to Trump with his own social media post calling the president \"A totally unserious person spreading false information in a desperate attempt to cope with his failures.\" Secretary of State Shirley Weber called it \"another baseless claim.\"\n\n\"The bottom line is California elections have been validated by the courts,\" she said in a statement. \"California voters will not be deceived by someone who consistently makes desperate, unsubstantiated attempts to dissuade Americans from participating in our democracy.\"\n\nIn Virginia as the polls closed, Susan Beals, commissioner of elections, thanked officials for running a \"very smooth election.\" Beals said there was a power outage in Virginia Beach, but the voting machine had battery backup and emergency lights came on so voting continued.\n\nIn New Jersey, law enforcement and election officials acted swiftly as voting began to secure polling places following a series of bomb threats.\n\nLt. Gov. Tahesha Way, who also serves as the state's top election official, said the threats had been emailed to seven counties, including Passaic, a key swing county. It also is the only county outside California where the Department of Justice had sent election monitors, in both cases at the request of the Republican parties in each state.\n\n\"Law enforcement has determined that there are no credible threats at this time,\" Way said. \"We are doing everything in our power to protect voters and poll workers and coordinate closely with state, local and federal partners to ensure a smooth and safe election.\"\n\nLater in the day, authorities arrested a juvenile suspect in connection with some of the bomb threats. The potential charges were not immediately released.\n\nA New Jersey judge granted a one-hour extension for voters to be able to cast ballots at some polling places in Passaic County.\n\nThe threats came as the final day of voting began in New Jersey's closely-watched race for governor and a year after a series of bomb threats disrupted voting during last year's presidential election, mostly in battleground states. Bomb threat hoaxes also circulated in Springfield, Ohio, last year after Donald Trump during the campaign amplified false claims of Haitian immigrants there abducting and eating pets.\n\nThe threats Tuesday involved nearly two dozen polling places in Bergen, Essex, Mercer, Middlesex, Monmouth, Ocean and Passaic counties, New Jersey Attorney General Matthew Platkin said in a statement. Some polling places reopened quickly, he said, while voters at others were directed to nearby locations to cast their ballots.\n\n\"Law enforcement officers have responded at each affected polling place, and they have worked swiftly to secure these polling locations and ensure the safety of every voter,\" Platkin said.\n\nThe FBI's Newark office said it was aware of the reports and was assisting the state and local agencies. \"This Dept. of Justice is committed to free, fair and safe elections,\" U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a social media post related to the bomb threat investigation.\n\nPassaic County received three threats and redirected some affected voters to other locations early Tuesday, county spokesperson Lindsay Reed said in an email. One location, a school building, was cleared and voting resumed.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, nearly 20% of voters in Chester County were left out of the poll books originally provided to polling locations Tuesday, county officials said. That included voters registered as anything other than a Republican or a Democrat, including those registered with the Green or Libertarian parties or independents with no party affiliation. The category includes about 75,000 registered voters out of roughly 385,000 countywide.\n\nA Chester County judge later extended voting by provisional ballot to 10 p.m. at all polling locations.\n\nElection officials in the Democratic-leaning county located about 40 miles (64.4 kilometers) west of Philadelphia became aware of the problem just after polling places opened and had provided supplemental poll books to all 230 polling locations by late afternoon. There will be a formal review.\n\nA majority of Chester County voters backed Democrat Kamala Harris over Trump in last year's presidential election. Voters on Tuesday were weighing in on local offices, as well as on members of Pennsylvania's highest court. Three Democratic justices on the state Supreme Court were running in nonpartisan retention elections, in which voters give a \"yes\" or \"no\" on whether they serve another term.\n\nThird-party and independent voters who came to cast ballots before supplemental poll books arrived were offered a provisional ballot. County review boards consider the status of provisional ballots within seven days of Election Day.\n\n___\n\nSmyth reported from Columbus, Ohio, and Fingerhut from Des Moines, Iowa.

        "title": "California voters approve new US House map to boost Democrats in 2026",
        "description": "LOS ANGELES -- California voters approved new congressional district boundaries Tuesday, delivering a victory for Democrats in the state-by-state redistricting battle that will help determine which party wins control of the U.S. House in 2026 and, with it, the power to thwart or advance President Donald Trump's agenda.\n\nThe approval of Proposition 50 gives Democrats a shot at winning as many as five additional seats, just enough to blunt Texas Republicans' move to redraw their own maps to pick up five GOP seats at Trump's urging. Texas' move and California's response have kicked off a flurry of redistricting efforts around the country, with Republican states appearing to have an edge. Deeply blue California is Democrats' best opportunity to make up seats.\n\nMidterm elections typically punish the party in the White House, and Trump is fighting to maintain his party's slim House majority. Republicans hold 219 seats to Democrats' 213.\n\nTuesday's results mark a political victory for Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, who cast the measure as an essential tool to fight back against Trump and protect American democracy.\n\nSpeaking to reporters in Sacramento, Newsom cast the California vote as part of a broader national rejection of Trump's policies that saw Democratic governors elevated in New Jersey and Virginia. But he warned the more consequential battle would come next year.\n\nIf Democrats win the House majority, they can \"end Donald Trump's presidency as we know it,\" Newsom said. \"It is all on the line, a bright line, in 2026.\"\n\nCalifornia's Proposition 50 asked voters to suspend House maps drawn by an independent commission and replace them with rejiggered districts adopted by the Democratic-controlled Legislature. Those new districts would be in place for the 2026, 2028 and 2030 elections.\n\nThe recast districts aim to dilute Republican voters' power, in one case by uniting rural, conservative-leaning parts of far northern California with Marin County, a famously liberal coastal stronghold across the Golden Gate Bridge from San Francisco.\n\nThe measure was spearheaded by Newsom, who threw the weight of his political operation behind it in a major test of his mettle ahead of a potential 2028 presidential campaign. Former President Barack Obama urged voters to pass it as well.\n\n\"Republicans want to steal enough seats in Congress to rig the next election and wield unchecked power for two more years,\" Obama said in one ad. \"You can stop Republicans in their tracks.\"\n\nCritics said two wrongs don't make a right. They urged Californians to reject the measure, even if they have misgivings about Trump's moves elsewhere.\n\nAmong the most prominent critics was Arnold Schwarzenegger, the movie star and former Republican governor who pushed for the creation of the independent commission, which voters approved in 2008 and 2010. It makes no sense to fight Trump by becoming him, Schwarzenegger said in September, arguing that the proposal would \"take the power away from the people.\"\n\n\"I don't want Newsom to have control,\" said Rebecca Fleshman, a 63-year-old retired medical assistant from Southern California, who voted against the measure. \"I don't want the state to be blue. I want it to be red.\"\n\nAfter an early burst of TV advertising, opponents of the plan struggled to raise cash in a state with some of the nation's most expensive media markets.\n\nThe campaign followed an unusual trajectory. A handful of Republican congressmen who will see their districts dramatically reshaped - and their jobs endangered -- mostly stayed away from the campaign spotlight. With opponents short on cash, Newsom and his supporters dominated TV screens in the critical closing weeks.\n\nTotal spending on broadcast and cable ads topped $100 million, with more than two-thirds of it coming from supporters. Newsom told people to stop donating in the race's final weeks.\n\nThe GOP congressmen -- Reps. Ken Calvert, Darrell Issa, Kevin Kiley, David Valadao and Doug LaMalfa -- will see right-leaning voters reduced and left-leaning voters boosted in their respective districts in a shift that would make it likely a Democratic candidate would prevail in each race.\n\nIssa issued a defiant statement, saying: \"I'm not going anywhere. I'll continue to represent the people of California regardless of their party or where they live.\"\n\nCalvert said Newsom engineered a \"power grab\" while housing costs, gas prices and taxes continue to strain family budgets. \"I am determined to keep fighting for the families I represent,\" he said in an email.\n\nProposition 50 won a swift and decisive victory, as the AP declared a winner when polls closed statewide. Early returns were strongly in favor of the measure, as were preliminary results from the AP Voter Poll, an expansive survey of more than 4,000 voters in California.\n\nRoughly 7 in 10 California voters said party control of Congress was \"very important\" to them, and those voters overwhelmingly supported the measure, according to the AP Voter Poll.\n\nAbout 8 in 10 California voters who supported the ballot measure said it was necessary to counter the changes made by Republicans in other states, while only about 2 in 10 said they supported it because it was the best way to draw maps, AP Voter Poll found.\n\nTrump, who overwhelmingly lost California in his three presidential campaigns, largely stayed out of the fray. A week before the election, he urged voters in a social media post not to vote early or by mail -- messaging that conflicted with that of top Republicans in the state who urged people to get their ballots in as soon as possible.\n\nIn a post Tuesday on his social media platform, the president called the state's voting process \"RIGGED\" and warned that it was \"under very serious legal and criminal review. STAY TUNED!\" Secretary of State Shirley Weber called that \"another baseless claim.\"\n\nCongressional district boundaries are typically redrawn every 10 years to reflect population shifts documented in the census. Mid-decade redistricting is unusual, absent a court order finding fault with the maps in place.\n\nBeyond Texas, Republicans expect to gain one seat each from new maps in Missouri and North Carolina, and potentially two more in Ohio. Five other GOP-led states are also considering new maps: Florida, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana and Nebraska.\n\nOn the Democratic side, Colorado, Illinois, Maryland, New York and Virginia have proposals to redraw maps, but major hurdles remain.\n\nA court has ordered new boundaries be drawn in Utah, where all four House districts are represented by Republicans, but it remains to be seen if the state will approve a map that makes any of them winnable for Democrats.\n\nSiddhartha Deb, 52, has lived in the U.S. since he was 7 years old but he just became a citizen Tuesday. Immediately afterward he registered to vote at San Francisco City Hall and cast his ballot in favor of Newsom's measure.\n\n\"I don't like the way the Republican Party is basically trying to rig elections by gerrymandering,\" Deb said. \"And this is the only way, to fight fire with fire.\"\n\n___\n\nCooper reported from Phoenix and Nguyen from Sacramento, California.

        "title": "California's Prop 50 redistricting measure may have consequences beyond its borders",
        "description": "Joe Walsh is a senior editor for digital politics at CBS News. Joe previously covered breaking news for Forbes and local news in Boston.\n\nCalifornia's approval of Proposition 50 sets in motion a redistricting plan that could result in pickups of five seats for Democrats in the Golden State. It's an effort that may ripple beyond California's borders -- here's an early look at some of Prop 50's potential effects, not all of which are related to redistricting:\n\nA win for Democrats\n\nProp 50 victory, among other things, notches a badly needed win for Democrats in the redistricting battle kicked off by President Trump earlier this year.\n\nThe president, seeking to gain up to five seats for Republicans to try to help them hold the House in the 2026 midterm elections, successfully urged Texas to undertake a mid-decade gerrymander. Newsom said he'd only go through with Prop 50 if Texas passed its new congressional map. In announcing the initiative, Newsom said Mr. Trump is \"trying to rig the system,\" adding \"we have got to meet fire with fire.\"\n\nNew lines would be temporary\n\nThe passage of the ballot measure, pending legal action, will result in a map drawn by California Democrats that takes five Republican congressional districts and makes them more favorable to Democrats. But it would only be used for the 2026, 2028 and 2030 elections.\n\nAfter the 2030 U.S. Census, according to Prop 50, the gerrymandered maps would only be used until the nonpartisan California Citizens Redistricting Commission draws new congressional maps.\n\nNewer maps that squeeze majority's opponents across the country\n\nMore and more states have begun trying to squeeze partisan minorities further through redistricting before next year's midterms. A CBS News poll in October found that among voters who plan to support Proposition 50, one reason they're doing so is to oppose the Trump administration -- which they also feel generally treats California worse than other states -- and to oppose national Republicans.\n\nCalifornia's decision to redraw its maps has already begun to exert pressure on more GOP-led states to launch their own redistricting gambits. Besides Texas, lawmakers in Missouri and North Carolina have passed new maps in recent months that shift one district apiece toward Republicans, and Ohio is considering new maps.\n\nRepublicans in Indiana signaled last month that they didn't have the votes to redraw their maps, but after weeks of pressure from Mr. Trump, GOP Gov. Mike Braun called the legislature into a special session to consider redistricting.\n\nAnd in Maryland, Democratic Gov. Wes Moore has just announced the creation of a redistricting commission to consider mid-decade redistricting.\n\n\"We will explore every avenue possible to make sure Maryland has fair and representative maps,\" Moore said in a statement. But Maryland state Senate president Bill Ferguson, also a Democrat, believes mid-cycle redistricting in Maryland \"is the wrong path for our State,\" he said on X. He warned of legal barriers to redistricting that could result in ceding \"one or two congressional seats to Donald Trump.\"\n\n\"There's fighting fire with fire, and then there's unintentionally burning your own house down in the process,\" Ferguson said.\n\nPlatform for Newsom's political future?\n\nDemocratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who has become one of Mr. Trump's highest-profile adversaries, was the architect of California's mid-decade redistricting effort and fought for the Prop 50 initiative. His push for Prop 50 may for a time have been the most public example of resistance by Democrats against Mr. Trump.\n\nNewsom has not ruled out a run for the presidency in 2028, and his success in selling Prop 50 to voters could help launch a campaign, especially if Democrats are able to take the House in 2026. And he indicated to Robert Costa in a late October interview on \"CBS Sunday Morning\" that he'll give serious thought to running after the 2026 midterm elections.\n\nVoters in Tuesday's race were divided on whether Newsom should run for president in 2028, with 45% saying he should and 54% saying he shouldn't, according to exit polling data.\n\nThe results of Prop 50 tracked closely with voters' views on Newsom's future: Some 94% of Californians who support a Newsom presidential run voted yes on Prop 50, while 65% of those who don't want him to run voted no.",

        "title": "'Repudiation': Democrats deliver warning to Trump as big midterm test approaches",
        "description": "With wins in New York City, New Jersey and Virginia, USA TODAY's Susan Page analyzes what this means for the Democrats moving forward.\n\nThe starting gun for the 2026 midterm elections found the GOP stumbling out of the gate, suffering loses across the country Tuesday in off-year contests that could signal discontent with President Donald Trump.\n\nTrump was a big factor in many races and is charging into the midterms with one of the most aggressive agendas in modern memory. The 2025 election indicates voters may be ready to pump the breaks, with Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer declaring the results a \"repudiation of the Trump agenda.\"\n\nGOP candidates who embraced the president - and were labeled by their Democratic opponents as Trump acolytes - lost governor's races in New Jersey and Virginia by big margins.\n\nCalifornia voters overwhelmingly approved an effort to check Trump's redistricting power plays and New York City elected a new mayor, Zohran Mamdani, who has feuded with the president. Mamdani targeted Trump in his victory speech.\n\nVirginia's new Democratic governor, Abigail Spanberger, also criticized the Trump administration in her victory speech, decrying the \"chaos coming out of Washington\" from Trump's cuts to the federal workforce. She also vowed not to \"stand by silently while you attack Virginia's workers.\"\n\nThe president blamed GOP loses on the government shutdown, and the fact that his name wasn't on the ballot.\n\nTrump has never carried California, New Jersey, Virginia or New York City, making it easier for Republicans to play down loses there. But the sizeable Democratic victories breathed life into a party that was throttled by Trump in 2024 and desperate to start winning again, while raising questions about the strength of the president's MAGA movement and whether he has overreached in his second term.\n\nDemocrats also may have found a more effective way to take on Trump, with the two candidates for governor tying his policies to economic concerns. They railed on his tariffs, cuts to the federal workforce and withholding of federal funds in blue areas during the shutdown. Mamdani criticized Trump's deportation push and use of the National Guard for policing, vowing to make the nation's largest city a bulwark against such efforts. Voters rewarded them.\n\nTrump has been maneuvering to prevent Democrats from winning a majority in Congress next year, which would put his legislative agenda on ice and usher in aggressive oversight of the White House. Facing an uphill climb in the midterms, which historically favor the party out of power, he is pushing to redraw the congressional map to create more GOP seats.\n\nThe rebuke from voters this year could add urgency to those efforts, which faced a setback in California. Gov. Gavin Newsom in a victory speech looked ahead to the midterms as a chance to \"de facto end Donald Trump's presidency.\"\n\nGOP lost, despite Trump's 2024 gains\n\nThe Republican losses in Virginia and New Jersey came despite both states moving toward Trump in 2024.\n\nTrump lost Virginia to Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris by five percentage points and New Jersey by six after losing both by double digits in 2020.\n\nSpanberger is on track for a double digit victory, a sign that Trump's policies may have backfired in a state with a lot of federal workers that has been hit hard by the Department of Government Efficiency cuts.\n\nTrump has tried to distance himself from the race, declaring he hasn't been \"too much involved in Virginia.\" He didn't endorse GOP candidate Winsome Earle-Sears and didn't even mention her name in a tele-rally he did for the Virginia GOP on the eve of the election.\n\nThe president was more invested in New Jersey, endorsing GOP candidate Jack Ciattarelli, promoting him on social media. He also praised him in a Nov. 3 tele-rally where he declared that \"The entire country is watching New Jersey.\"\n\nDespite his efforts, Democrat Mikie Sherrill also is on track to pull out a comfortable double digit win.\n\nBoth Sherrill and Spanberger made Trump a frequent target, tying their opponents to the president's policies and blaming him for cost-of-living issues, which could be a model for Democrats going into the midterms.\n\nCalifornia voters 'stick it to Trump'\n\nThe clearest setback for the president came in California, though, where his efforts to craft a more favorable midterm map hit a roadblock.\n\nCalifornia voters resoundingly approved Proposition 50, an effort led by Newsom to redraw the state's House map to create more Democrat-leaning seats to counter a push by Trump that has created more GOP-leaning seats in Texas and Missouri.\n\nNewsom said the results show the Democratic Party is \"on its toes, no longer on its heels.\" He painted the victory as an \"extraordinary moment\" in an ongoing campaign to pushback on Trump's presidency with midterm victories.\n\nProposition 50 supporters made the race a referendum on Trump. Ads called for voters to \"stick it to Trump.\" They did, showcasing a desire to pushback on a president who has sought to expand executive power.\n\nThe extent of that appetite will be tested in the midterms, where voters have another opportunity to put a check on Trump with a Democratic majority in Congress. California may not have the final say on redistricting, though.\n\nTrump is leaning on more red state leaders to deliver new GOP seats in an escalating battle over the congressional map.\n\nAlarm bells for GOP\n\nThe election results add to a pile of evidence that backlash is building on Trump.\n\nMillions of Americans hit the streets for \"No Kings\" protests in June and October, decrying everything from the president's mass deportations to his deployments of the National Guard in various cities.\n\nDemocrats also performed well in special elections earlier this year, leading party leaders to predict that the Nov. 4 results would add to that momentum. Trump's disapproval rating hit 63% in a new CNN/SSRS poll, the highest level in CNN polling throughout both of his terms.\n\nEven Vice President JD Vance warned in a Fox News interview earlier this year that one of the president's pollsters \"once told me that anger usually wins midterm elections.\"\n\nThe left is \"very angry right now and they're very motivated,\" Vance added.",

        "title": "California Voters Approved a New Map That Helps Democrats. Now What?",
        "description": "Californians struck back at Republican redistricting efforts around the country on Tuesday, passing a new congressional map designed to flip five red districts and give Democrats a better shot at retaking the House of Representatives next year.\n\nNow that the Proposition 50 map will officially take effect for the next three congressional elections -- in 2026, 2028 and 2030 -- a flurry of Democratic challengers are expected to jump into the newly competitive House race. They will join candidates who announced their entry before voters approved the districts.\n\nOver all, the changes could result in Democrats representing nearly all of Northern California in the House, including the conservative far reaches toward the Oregon border. While Republicans will fight to protect their incumbents, they also plan to file lawsuits to challenge Proposition 50 in court.\n\nHere's what to know about California's new congressional maps.\n\nThree Republicans are particularly vulnerable\n\nFar from the liberal bastions of San Francisco and Los Angeles, California's rural northeast had long been reliable Republican territory. No longer, under the Proposition 50 map.\n\nThe current district of Representative Kevin Kiley, a Republican, stretches from the suburbs outside Sacramento to Lake Tahoe in the north and southward along the Nevada border. It now adds neighborhoods in Sacramento County to become a likely flip for Democrats, according to nonpartisan political analyses of the new map.\n\nMr. Kiley has won tough races before, but he could face a host of experienced Democratic challengers. He could square off against Dr. Richard Pan, the former state senator who has already announced a campaign against him. Local strategists said that other Democrats may be considering the same district, including Representative Ami Bera and State Senator Angelique Ashby.\n\nThe seat has become so vulnerable that Mr. Kiley could consider running in a neighboring district if he likes his chances better there. House candidates do not have to live in the district they represent.\n\nRepresentative Doug LaMalfa, a Republican, faces a similar challenge in his Northern California district, which currently hugs the Oregon border and represents a large agricultural region north of Sacramento. The new map divides his current district, with one new district pulling in a heavily Democratic part of Wine Country and the other adding liberal Marin County.\n\nAudrey Denney, an educator and consultant who lost twice before to Mr. LaMalfa, has already announced a third try against him. Some political strategists have speculated that the race could also attract Mike McGuire, the leader of the California State Senate.\n\nIn Riverside County, east of Los Angeles, Representative Ken Calvert is another Republican who has become suddenly vulnerable. In this case, his district has been carved up and folded into several neighboring districts.\n\n\"We don't see a path for them if this map passes,\" said David Wasserman, the senior elections analyst for the nonpartisan Cook Political Report, said of the Republican incumbents in these three districts.\n\n\"The incumbency bonus is nowhere as big as it used to be,\" Mr. Wasserman added.\n\nDemocrats are eyeing two other seats\n\nThe districts of two Republican congressmen were not reconfigured quite as radically. Still, Representative Darrell Issa, who holds a seat in the inland San Diego area, and Representative David Valadao, in the southern part of the Central Valley, will now be in races that analysts consider to be coin flips.\n\nMr. Issa won re-election last year by nearly 20 percentage points, but Proposition 50 added liberal Palm Springs to his district, making it more favorable to Democrats than before. Ammar Campa-Najjar, who has lost twice before to Mr. Issa, and Marni von Wilpert, a San Diego city councilwoman, are Mr. Issa's most prominent challengers. Several others also could shift from focusing on Mr. Calvert to targeting Mr. Issa.\n\nMr. Valadao is no stranger to tough races because his seat has regularly been one of the nation's most competitive. He won re-election by less than 1 percentage point in 2020. Two years before that, he was ousted by a similar margin.\n\nBut under Proposition 50, his Central Valley district will shed some of its more conservative areas, giving Democrats a greater advantage than before. At least two Democrats have already said they will challenge him: Dr. Jasmeet Bains, a state assemblywoman, and Randy Villegas, a local school board trustee.\n\nMr. Valadao, well aware of his district, has taken a more moderate path than his fellow Republican House members. In 2021, he was one of 10 House members to vote to impeach President Trump over the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol.\n\nAndrew Acosta, a California Democratic strategist, suggested that many Democrats in the state had forgotten how rough-and-tumble an ultracompetitive House race can get, especially in more conservative regions. Democratic challengers who embrace moderate political views, he argued, stood the best shot against the incumbents.\n\n\"We've gotten fat and happy here in California,\" he said. \"We think that this is a big blue state, and everyone loves everybody until you're in a competitive race -- and all of the sudden you realize that Gavin Newsom is not as popular in the district.\"\n\nVulnerable Democrats -- plus one Orange County Republican -- can breathe easier\n\nDemocrats also shored up districts held by more than a half-dozen of their vulnerable incumbents, such as Representatives Derek Tran in Southern California and Adam Gray in the Central Valley. Both are first-term congressmen who each won last year by fewer than 1,000 votes.\n\nBy strengthening their grip on once-vulnerable seats, Democrats could free up time and resources to focus on ousting Republican incumbents and winning races in other states. But making some districts more favorable to Democrats came at a cost: Representative Young Kim, a Republican in a competitive Orange County seat, gained Republican regions that will likely put her once-competitive seat out of reach for Democrats.\n\nDan Schnur, a politics professor at the University of Southern California, said the new map -- and the efforts to put competitive Democratic-held areas out of reach -- would erode the power of California Republicans even further.\n\n\"After this redistricting takes place,\" Mr. Schnur said, \"there won't be much red California left.\"\n\nBut competitive districts that seem winnable on paper can prove elusive for either party. Mr. Acosta warned that beating Republican incumbents on their home turf might not be so easy.\n\n\"There is a consistent theme for most of them that they've been battle-tested,\" he said. \"They've been in races where they've won, they've lost, they've come back and won again.\"",

        "title": "6 Takeaways From Elections in Virginia, New Jersey, New York and Beyond",
        "description": "In Virginia, New Jersey and beyond, Democratic voters powered their candidates to victory and sent a warning sign to President Trump and his Republican Party.\n\nIt was the wave election of 2025.\n\nDemocrats, furious about President Trump's remaking of American government and society, turned out in extraordinary numbers for an off-year election to sweep virtually every competitive election on the map.\n\nThe results served as a rebuke of Mr. Trump and his Republican Party and a salve for Democrats who have not had many good nights in the last year. Next will come a fierce, yearlong fight, first in redistricting battles and then the midterm elections, for control of the House of Representatives and the fate of Mr. Trump's agenda during the final two years of his term.\n\nHere are six takeaways from the first major elections of the second Trump era.\n\nDemocrats finally showed some fight.\n\nDemocrats have spent the last year locked out of power in Washington, searching furiously but mostly in vain for ways to stop President Trump from expanding his power.\n\nThey held protests, spoke all night in the Senate and organized \"No Kings\" rallies that drew millions across the country.\n\nOn Tuesday, they finally hit back in a more concrete way.\n\nDemocrats won statewide elections in Virginia, New Jersey, California and Pennsylvania. They flipped seats on Georgia's Public Service Commission. And they were on the verge of winning a near two-thirds majority in the Virginia House of Delegates, an extraordinary sweep of battleground districts in races that serve as a plausible stand-in for how voters view both parties given the anonymous nature of most of the candidates.\n\nIn New York City, Zohran Mamdani was hovering around 50 percent of the vote in the governor's race as he coasted past former Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who won support from Mr. Trump and other Republicans.\n\nWhen Democrats roared to victory in 2017, during Mr. Trump's first term, it foreshadowed a blue wave in the midterms a year later. On Tuesday night, House Democratic officials were crowing that this year's results would help them recruit strong candidates to challenge Republicans next year.\n\nIt was a bad night for Donald Trump.\n\nIn Virginia, Abigail Spanberger won the governor's race by focusing on Mr. Trump's firing of federal workers and the impact of the government shutdown on her state.\n\nIn New Jersey, Representative Mikie Sherrill finished her successful campaign by railing against Mr. Trump's demand that a key Hudson River tunnel be \"terminated.\"\n\nIn New York City, Mr. Trump's Election Eve endorsement of Mr. Cuomo caused Republicans to swing toward the former governor, but failed to thwart Mr. Mamdani.\n\nAnd in California, voters responded to calls to save the nation from Mr. Trump by approving a ballot measure to redraw the state's congressional districts to shift five of them from to Democrats from Republicans.\n\nThe president was not on the ballot in any of these places, but in each one, Democrats ran against his policies and yoked their opponents to him.\n\nAfter similar results in New Jersey and Virginia eight years ago, Democrats nearly ran the table in the 2018 midterm elections. Democrats are already arguing that Tuesday was a harbinger for the 2026 midterms, while Republicans claim it was a blue-state blip.\n\nMamdani gives Democrats a new leader.\n\nIn a year's time, Zohran Mamdani has gone from searching for random New Yorkers to talk to him to becoming one of the biggest stars in American politics.\n\nNow the New York City mayor-elect at 34 years old, he represents the vanguard of Democratic politics. He is an unabashed progressive and a self-described democratic socialist who is sympathetic to the Palestinian cause.\n\nHe also offers a new strategic blueprint to a Democratic Party that has for a decade been defined primarily by its opposition to Mr. Trump.\n\nMr. Mamdani, in defeating Mr. Cuomo in both the primary and general elections, gave New York voters a clear alternative with a defined vision. He focused relentlessly on the cost of living, spoke endlessly about the prices of nearly everything and expressed an adoration for New York City that few other politicians show for the places they call home.\n\nAnd he did it by blazing a creative, compelling path online, both through his own social media channels and his appearances with scores of influencers and podcasters.\n\nMr. Mamdani's progressive politics may not play as well outside New York City, and Republicans have already signaled they will seek to tie the party's candidates to a Muslim immigrant, but Democrats running in the midterm elections are likely to copy his tactics and message discipline.\n\nEven Democrats will shrug at a scandal.\n\nIn the final weeks of Virginia's campaign for attorney general, it was revealed that Jay Jones, the Democratic nominee, had sent violent text messages about a political rival and had been caught driving 116 miles per hour.\n\nBut no prominent Virginia Democrat called for him to quit the race. Mr. Jones apologized, withstood a torrent of attack ads and rode huge Democratic turnout to victory.\n\nThe post-shame era continues apace.\n\nSuch was the antipathy toward Republican candidates in Virginia that Mr. Jones, even saddled with controversy, performed better than Vice President Kamala Harris did last year in Loudoun County, a key exurb of Washington.\n\nMr. Jones's political future might have a ceiling because of his scandals in this election, but for tonight, at least, he is as happy as can be.\n\nNo Trump on the ballot? Advantage, Democrats.\n\nMr. Trump drives Republican voters to the polls -- but only when he is on the ballot.\n\nDemocrats have overperformed in every nonpresidential election year since 2017. Their voters are now the ones who turn out for off-year and midterm elections, while Mr. Trump's loyal Republican base turns out in big numbers only in presidential years.\n\nThis played out this year in Wisconsin's Supreme Court race, when the liberal candidate prevailed by double digits, and in a series of special elections. It was again evident on Tuesday as Democrats prevailed easily in Virginia and New Jersey.\n\nMr. Trump will not be on the ballot in next year's midterm elections, but it is a safe bet that Democrats will again try to make him the centerpiece of their campaigns.\n\nNewsom helped House Democrats, and himself.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom of California has been on a not-very-secret mission for national attention since before the 2024 presidential election.\n\nAnd with a blowout victory in a ballot measure to redraw the state's congressional map in Democrats' favor, Mr. Newsom helped his party's midterm chances and proved that he could turn out voters in a critical election.\n\nIn the short term, the nearly two-to-one margin for \"yes\" on California's ballot measure may serve as fuel for Democrats in other blue states weighing their own redistricting plans. In his victory remarks, Mr. Newsom made an explicit call for other states -- including ones with ambitious Democratic governors, like Colorado, Illinois and Maryland -- to follow California's lead on redistricting before the midterm elections.\n\nAhead of the next presidential contest, it provides Mr. Newsom with concrete evidence of what he did to combat Mr. Trump in an era when Democratic voters are hungry for fighters.\n\nHow he uses that platform remains to be seen, but it is not much of a mystery where his ambition lies.",

        "title": "California voters approve new U.S. House map to boost Democrats in 2026",
        "description": "California Governor Gavin Newsom announces that California is suing the White House to restore SNAP funding before the cutoff during a news conference in Sacramento, California, U.S., Oct. 28, 2025.\n\nCalifornia voters approved new congressional district boundaries Tuesday, delivering a victory for Democrats in the state-by-state redistricting battle that will help determine which party wins control of the U.S. House in 2026 and, with it, the power to thwart or advance President Donald Trump's agenda.\n\nThe approval of Proposition 50 gives Democrats a shot at winning as many as five additional seats, just enough to blunt Texas Republicans' move to redraw their own maps to pick up five GOP seats at Trump's urging. Texas' move and California's response have kicked off a flurry of redistricting efforts around the country, with Republican states appearing to have an edge. Deeply blue California is Democrats' best opportunity to make up seats.\n\nMidterm elections typically punish the party in the White House, and Trump is fighting to maintain his party's slim House majority. Republicans hold 219 seats to Democrats' 213.\n\nTuesday's results mark a political victory for Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, who cast the measure as an essential tool to fight back against Trump and protect American democracy.\n\nMeasure supported by Newsom, Obama\n\nCalifornia's Proposition 50 asked voters to suspend House maps drawn by an independent commission and replace them with rejiggered districts adopted by the Democratic-controlled Legislature. Those new districts would be in place for the 2026, 2028 and 2030 elections.\n\nThe recast districts aim to dilute Republican voters' power, in one case by uniting rural, conservative-leaning parts of far northern California with Marin County, a famously liberal coastal stronghold across the Golden Gate Bridge from San Francisco.\n\nThe measure was spearheaded by Newsom, who threw the weight of his political operation behind it in a major test of his mettle ahead of a potential 2028 presidential campaign. Former President Barack Obama urged voters to pass it as well.\n\nNewsom sought to nationalize the campaign, depicting the proposal as a counterweight to all things Trump.\n\n\"Republicans want to steal enough seats in Congress to rig the next election and wield unchecked power for two more years,\" Obama says in one ad. \"You can stop Republicans in their tracks.\"\n\nCritics said two wrongs don't make a right. They urged Californians to reject what they call a Democratic power grab, even if they have misgivings about Trump's moves in Republican-led states.\n\nAmong the most prominent critics was Arnold Schwarzenegger, the movie star and former Republican governor who pushed for the creation of the independent commission, which voters approved in 2008 and 2010. It makes no sense to fight Trump by becoming him, Schwarzenegger said in September, arguing that the proposal would \"take the power away from the people.\"\n\n\"I don't want Newsom to have control,\" said Rebecca Fleshman, a 63-year-old retired medical assistant from Norco in Southern California, who voted against the measure. \"I don't want the state to be blue. I want it to be red.\"\n\nA lopsided campaign foreshadowed the vote\n\nAfter an early burst of TV advertising, opponents of the plan struggled to raise cash in a state with some of the nation's most expensive media markets. Data compiled by advertising tracker AdImpact last week showed Democrats and other supporters with over $5 million in ad buys booked on broadcast TV, cable and radio. But opponents had virtually no time reserved, though the data didn't include some popular streaming services like Hulu and YouTube or mail advertising.\n\nThe campaign followed an unusual trajectory. A handful of Republican congressmen who will see their districts dramatically reshaped - and their jobs endangered -- mostly stayed away from the campaign spotlight. With opponents short on cash, Newsom and his supporters dominated TV screens in the critical closing weeks.\n\nTotal spending on broadcast and cable ads topped $100 million, with more than two-thirds of it coming from supporters. Newsom told people to stop donating in the race's final weeks.\n\nThe GOP congressmen -- Reps. Ken Calvert, Darrell Issa, Kevin Kiley, David Valadao and Doug LaMalfa -- will see right-leaning voters reduced and left-leaning voters boosted in their respective districts in a shift that would make it likely a Democratic candidate would prevail in each race.\n\nIssa issued a defiant statement, saying: \"I'm not going anywhere. I'll continue to represent the people of California regardless of their party or where they live. I'm not quitting on California.\"\n\nCalvert said Newsom engineered a \"power grab\" while housing costs, gas prices and taxes continue to strain family budgets. \"I am determined to keep fighting for the families I represent,\" he said in an email.\n\nAP poll finds voters motivated by political reasons\n\nProposition 50 won a swift and decisive victory, as the AP declared a winner when polls closed statewide. Early returns were strongly in favor of the measure, as were preliminary results from the AP Voter Poll, an expansive survey of more than 4,000 voters in California.\n\nRoughly 7 in 10 California voters said party control of Congress was \"very important\" to them, and those voters overwhelmingly supported the measure, according to the AP Voter Poll.\n\nAbout 8 in 10 California voters who supported the ballot measure said it was necessary to counter the changes made by Republicans in other states, while only about 2 in 10 said they supported it because it was the best way to draw maps, AP Voter Poll found.\n\nTrump, who overwhelmingly lost California in his three presidential campaigns, largely stayed out of the fray. A week before the election, he urged voters in a social media post not to vote early or by mail -- messaging that conflicted with that of top Republicans in the state who urged people to get their ballots in as soon as possible.\n\nIn a post Tuesday on his social media platform, the president called the state's voting process \"RIGGED\" and warned that it was \"under very serious legal and criminal review. STAY TUNED!\" Secretary of State Shirley Weber called that \"another baseless claim.\"\n\nThe national House map is in flux\n\nDemocrats hope to pick up as many as five seats in California if voters approve the new boundaries, offsetting the five that Republicans are looking to pick up through their new Texas maps. Republicans also expect to gain one seat each from new maps in Missouri and North Carolina, and potentially two more in Ohio.\n\nCongressional district boundaries are typically redrawn every 10 years to reflect population shifts documented in the census. Mid-decade redistricting is unusual, absent a court order finding fault with the maps in place.\n\nFive other GOP-led states are also considering new maps: Florida, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana and Nebraska.\n\nOn the Democratic side, Colorado, Illinois, Maryland, New York and Virginia have proposals to redraw maps, but major hurdles remain.\n\nA court has ordered new boundaries be drawn in Utah, where all four House districts are represented by Republicans, but it remains to be seen if the state will approve a map that makes any of them winnable for Democrats.\n\nSiddhartha Deb, 52, has lived in the U.S. since he was 7 years old but he just became a citizen Tuesday. Immediately afterward he registered to vote at San Francisco City Hall and cast his ballot in favor of Newsom's measure.\n\n\"I don't like the way the Republican Party is basically trying to rig elections by gerrymandering,\" Deb said. \"And this is the only way, to fight fire with fire.\"",

        "title": "California voters approve new Congressional map to boost Democrats in 2026",
        "description": "LOS ANGELES -- California voters approved new congressional district boundaries Tuesday, delivering a victory for Democrats in the state-by-state redistricting battle that will help determine which party wins control of the U.S. House in 2026 and, with it, the power to thwart or advance President Donald Trump's agenda.\n\nThe approval of Proposition 50 gives Democrats a shot at winning as many as five additional seats, just enough to blunt Texas Republicans' move to redraw their own maps to pick up five GOP seats at Trump's urging. Texas' move and California's response have kicked off a flurry of redistricting efforts around the country, with Republican states appearing to have an edge. Deeply blue California is Democrats' best opportunity to make up seats.\n\nMidterm elections typically punish the party in the White House, and Trump is fighting to maintain his party's slim House majority. Republicans hold 219 seats to Democrats' 213.\n\nTuesday's results mark a political victory for Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, who cast the measure as an essential tool to fight back against Trump and protect American democracy.\n\nCalifornia's Proposition 50 asked voters to suspend House maps drawn by an independent commission and replace them with rejiggered districts adopted by the Democratic-controlled Legislature. Those new districts would be in place for the 2026, 2028 and 2030 elections.\n\nThe recast districts aim to dilute Republican voters' power, in one case by uniting rural, conservative-leaning parts of far northern California with Marin County, a famously liberal coastal stronghold across the Golden Gate Bridge from San Francisco.\n\nThe measure was spearheaded by Newsom, who threw the weight of his political operation behind it in a major test of his mettle ahead of a potential 2028 presidential campaign. Former President Barack Obama urged voters to pass it as well.\n\nNewsom sought to nationalize the campaign, depicting the proposal as a counterweight to all things Trump.\n\n\"Republicans want to steal enough seats in Congress to rig the next election and wield unchecked power for two more years,\" Obama says in one ad. \"You can stop Republicans in their tracks.\"\n\nCritics said two wrongs don't make a right. They urged Californians to reject what they call a Democratic power grab, even if they have misgivings about Trump's moves in Republican-led states.\n\nAmong the most prominent critics was Arnold Schwarzenegger, the movie star and former Republican governor who pushed for the creation of the independent commission, which voters approved in 2008 and 2010. It makes no sense to fight Trump by becoming him, Schwarzenegger said in September, arguing that the proposal would \"take the power away from the people.\"\n\n\"I don't want Newsom to have control,\" said Rebecca Fleshman, a 63-year-old retired medical assistant from Norco in Southern California, who voted against the measure. \"I don't want the state to be blue. I want it to be red.\"\n\nAfter an early burst of TV advertising, opponents of the plan struggled to raise cash in a state with some of the nation's most expensive media markets. Data compiled by advertising tracker AdImpact last week showed Democrats and other supporters with over $5 million in ad buys booked on broadcast TV, cable and radio. But opponents had virtually no time reserved, though the data didn't include some popular streaming services like Hulu and YouTube or mail advertising.\n\nThe campaign followed an unusual trajectory. A handful of Republican congressmen who will see their districts dramatically reshaped - and their jobs endangered - mostly stayed away from the campaign spotlight. With opponents short on cash, Newsom and his supporters dominated TV screens in the critical closing weeks.\n\nTotal spending on broadcast and cable ads topped $100 million, with more than two-thirds of it coming from supporters. Newsom told people to stop donating in the race's final weeks.\n\nThe GOP congressmen - Reps. Ken Calvert, Darrell Issa, Kevin Kiley, David Valadao and Doug LaMalfa - will see right-leaning voters reduced and Democratic voters boosted in their respective districts in a shift that would make it likely a Democratic candidate would prevail in each race.\n\nTrump, who overwhelmingly lost California in his three presidential campaigns, largely stayed out of the fray. A week before the election, he urged voters in a social media post not to vote early or by mail - messaging that conflicted with that of top Republicans in the state who urged people to get their ballots in as soon as possible.\n\nIn a post Tuesday on his social media platform, the president called the state's voting process \"RIGGED\" and warned that it was \"under very serious legal and criminal review. STAY TUNED!\" Secretary of State Shirley Weber called it \"another baseless claim.\"\n\nDemocrats hope to pick up as many as five seats in California if voters approve the new boundaries, offsetting the five that Republicans are looking to pick up through their new Texas maps. Republicans also expect to gain one seat each from new maps in Missouri and North Carolina, and potentially two more in Ohio.\n\nCongressional district boundaries are typically redrawn every 10 years to reflect population shifts documented in the census. Mid-decade redistricting is unusual, absent a court order finding fault with the maps in place.\n\nFive other GOP-led states are also considering new maps: Florida, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana and Nebraska.\n\nOn the Democratic side, Colorado, Illinois, Maryland, New York and Virginia have proposals to redraw maps, but major hurdles remain.\n\nA court has ordered new boundaries be drawn in Utah, where all four House districts are represented by Republicans, but it remains to be seen if the state will approve a map that makes any of them winnable for Democrats.\n\nSiddhartha Deb, 52, has lived in the U.S. since he was 7 years old but he just became a citizen Tuesday. Immediately afterward he registered to vote at San Francisco City Hall and cast his ballot in favor of Newsom's measure.\n\n\"I don't like the way the Republican Party is basically trying to rig elections by gerrymandering,\" Deb said. \"And this is the only way, to fight fire with fire.\"",

        "description": "Cecilio Padilla is a digital producer for CBS Sacramento and a Sacramento-area native who has been covering Northern California for more than a decade.\n\nCalifornia voters have passed Proposition 50, CBS News projects, approving a measure backed by Gov. Gavin Newsom and legislative Democrats that will redraw the state's congressional districts.\n\nThe measure is intended to make several Republican-held congressional districts in California more favorable to Democrats in the 2026 midterm elections in an effort to counter recent redistricting in states including Texas that favors Republicans.\n\nProposition 50's passage drew swift reaction from high-profile opponents of the measure, including Republican political donor Charles Munger, Jr.\n\n\"For what looms for the people of California, I am saddened by the passage of Proposition 50,\" Munger said. \"But I am content in this, at least: that our campaign educated the people of California so they could make an informed, if in my view unwise, decision about such a technical but critical issue as redistricting reform, a decision forced to be made over such a very short time.\"\n\nProposition 50 was approved by the Legislature and signed by Newsom on Aug. 21, allowing it to go before voters for a Nov. 4 special election.\n\nHere's what to know about Proposition 50 and California's special election.\n\nIt could take several days to count all mail-in ballots, as California accepts ballots postmarked by Election Day and received within seven days.\n\nProposition 50 will replace California's current congressional district maps that were drawn by the independent California Citizens Redistricting Commission after the 2020 U.S. Census. New maps, crafted by the state Legislature, redraw the state's congressional districts to make five Republican-held U.S. House seats in California more favorable for Democrats in the 2026 midterm elections.\n\nCalifornia Democrats have called Proposition 50 a countermeasure to Texas' recent redistricting push that was backed by President Trump and created five Republican-friendly congressional seats in that state.\n\nCalifornia voters approved the creation of the independent redistricting commission earlier this century to oversee the congressional mapmaking process. The commission uses census data and public input to set district boundaries that reflect population changes and keep communities together.\n\nIf voters had rejected Proposition 50, California would have continued using its current congressional district boundaries until new maps are drawn by the redistricting commission after the 2030 Census.\n\nGov. Newsom and top Democratic leaders, including many who are trying to succeed him in California's 2026 gubernatorial race, have championed Proposition 50.\n\nOther major supporters of Proposition 50 include billionaire investors George Soros and Tom Steyer, and former President Barack Obama, who featured in a Yes on 50 campaign ad, calling on voters to approve the ballot measure.\n\nSupporters argue that Proposition 50 defends democracy and restores fairness after redistricting efforts in GOP-led states like Texas.\n\nFormer Republican California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger has criticized the redistricting effort, saying the initiative \"doesn't make sense.\" Schwarzenegger has also appeared in ads that oppose Proposition 50.\n\nOthers who oppose the initiative include Republican political donor Charles Munger, Jr., who contributed more than $32.7 million, and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy.\n\nOpponents argue that Proposition 50 is gerrymandering and that California should maintain its standard for fair redistricting through independent, citizen-led redistricting.\n\nProposition 50 was placed on the ballot by the California Legislature earlier this year.\n\nLawmakers approved the measure during a special session in August, and Newsom's signature set the stage for this statewide special election.\n\nAmong California's 52 congressional districts, Democrats represent 43 while Republicans represent nine.\n\nProposition 50 was created to redraw congressional districts to make five of them currently held by GOP House members more favorable to being won by Democrats in next year's midterms. Still, there is no guarantee that Democrats will win the seats even though voters have approved the new maps.\n\nThe five Republican-led congressional districts most targeted under Proposition 50 are Rep. Doug LaMalfa's District 1, Rep. Kevin Kiley's District 3, Rep. David Valadao's District 22, Rep. Ken Calvert's District 41, and Rep. Darrell Issa's District 48.",

        "description": "Redistricting and voting rights take center stage as Californians vote on Proposition 50.\n\nCalifornia voters sent a strong anti-Donald Trump message on Tuesday by passing Proposition 50, another big win for Democrats during the 2025 off-year election that helps the party in the nationwide redistricting frenzy that will help decide who controls the U.S. House in the final two years of the Republican president's second term.\n\nProp. 50 is a constitutional amendment pushed by Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom that would allow the nation's most populous state to temporarily stop using a nonpartisan commission to draw congressional district boundaries. Instead, California will use lines drawn by Democratic state lawmakers to increase the seats they hold in Congress.\n\nAfter the 2030 U.S. Census the nonpartisan commission will resume drawing the lines.\n\nThe California measure was one of the most important issues being decided during an Election Day that saw Democrats also win their governor races in New Jersey and Virginia. It essentially negates the five new Republican-leaning congressional districts Texas created earlier this year at Trump's urging. Those boundaries have been challenged in federal court.\n\nAt least a dozen states have changed their boundary lines or are in the process of doing so before the 2026 midterms. But, with the largest Republican and Democratic delegations, respectively, all eyes have been on what Texas and California would do.\n\nRepublicans hold a razor-thin majority in the U.S. House and historically, the party that controls the White House fares poorly in midterm elections.\n\nHaving a Republican controlled Trump-friendly U.S. House could allow the president to continue one of the most aggressive and disruptive agendas in modern presidential history for his entire term. A Democratic majority opens the door to years of congressional investigations, legislative paralysis - even a third Trump impeachment.\n\nOther states underway\n\nRepublicans have signed a new maps into law in Missouri -- though voters may have the opportunity to reject the Missouri map in a special election. Ohio approved new maps in a bipartisan deal, North Carolina redrew districts expected to edge out one House Democrat and Indiana lawmakers have set a date next month to consider redistricting.\n\nDemocratic leaders are also pushing blue states to drawing new lines to help their party too. Democratic-controlled legislatures in Illinois, New York, and Maryland are considering it.\n\nRepublican and Democratic leaders in Washington are still speaking with state lawmakers and more states could follow suit. But with the 2026 primaries beginning in the spring, time is beginning to run out.\n\nSigns of voter support\n\nCalifornia support for the change appeared high during the weeks of early voting despite the state's longtime pride over the nonpartisan commission, said Mark Baldassare, survey director at the Public Policy Institute of California and a leading expert on California voter opinion.\n\nA statewide survey released Oct. 28 by the Public Policy Institute of California found that 56% of likely voters said they would vote yes on the proposition. The survey also found that regardless of their position on the proposition, nine in 10 voters said they believe the outcome is somewhat important, and two in three said it was very important.\n\n\"We've not seen such a high level of importance placed on a ballot proposition since the survey began measuring this over 20 years ago,\" said PPIC researcher Deja Thomas.\n\nThe survey found that Trump's consistently low approval ratings in California remained in place and that Californians identify political extremism or threats to democracy as the most important problem facing the nation.",

        "title": "Five takeaways as Democrats sweep elections in New Jersey, Virginia",
        "description": "Democrats swept key elections across the country on Tuesday night, delivering a rebuke of President Donald Trump's second term so far and boosting the party's hopes ahead of the midterms.\n\nIn Virginia -- traditionally a bellwether in the year after a presidential election -- Democrats won every statewide contest and Abigail Spanberger led the governor's race by double digits with more than 90 percent of the vote tallied. In New Jersey, Democratic gubernatorial pick Mikie Sherrill easily beat back a strong Republican candidate she attacked for embracing Trump.\n\nIn California, Democrats won a ballot measure to redraw their congressional districts that they pitched as a check on Trump -- a response to the president's push to squeeze more GOP House seats out of red states.\n\n\"We were the barometer tonight for what the American public is feeling one year into Trump term two,\" Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Virginia) said in an interview. \"We basically sent a message that we can do a hell of a lot better than we're doing.\"\n\nIn New York City, meanwhile, democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani was elected mayor after a race full of surprises that thrust him to the center of Democrats' debates about the direction of their party. He clinched the Democratic nomination in an upset over former governor Andrew M. Cuomo, who then ran as an independent and received last-minute support from Trump. Mamdani impressed Democrats with his energetic, online-savvy campaign but worried others who are anxious about alienating moderate voters.\n\nRepublicans expected a tough political environment nationwide this year as polls showed voters souring on Trump, though some had been hopeful about springing an upset or two. Democrats focused much of their marquee campaigns on the president, spending roughly $18 million on general election ads mentioning Trump in Virginia and New Jersey, while just $1.3 million of Republicans' ads mentioned the president, according to AdImpact.\n\nHere are some top takeaways:\n\nIn this article\n\nDemocrats won handily in New Jersey\n\nReturn to menu\n\nPolling heading into Tuesday showed a more competitive race than Democrats would have liked. But Sherrill wound up winning handily, just like Spanberger. Late in the night, Sherrill led by double digits with more than three-quarters of the vote counted.\n\nRepublicans had some reasons for optimism earlier. Their candidate, 63-year-old businessman Jack Ciattarelli, came within three points of defeating Gov. Phil Murphy (D) in 2021. New Jersey shifted to the right more than any state besides New York last fall. Democrats have controlled state government for almost eight years, and Ciattarelli blamed them for the high cost of living while arguing his opponent would bring more of the same.\n\nTrump endorsed Ciattarelli and held a telerally for him the night before the election. \"Your state has been wrecked by radical left Democrats ... now it is time for a change,\" he said on the call.\n\nBut Ciattarelli's failure to separate himself from Trump became a liability. Sherrill, a 53-year-old congresswoman and former Navy helicopter pilot, said she would stand up to the White House and attacked Ciattarelli for saying at a debate that Trump is \"right about everything that he's doing.\"\n\nOne especially awkward moment for Ciattarelli came when Trump said his administration \"terminated\" a multibillion-dollar rail tunnel project connecting New York City and New Jersey. Democrats blasted it as an example of Trump's harm to the state.\n\nAffordability was the central issue in the race. Sherrill said she would freeze utility rates on her first day in office, while Ciattarelli said he would lower taxes and also work to bring down energy costs.\n\nDemocrats swept in Virginia -- despite a text scandal\n\nReturn to menu\n\nDemocrats were expecting a good night in Virginia -- but it wasn't clear that would extend to their embattled attorney general nominee, Jay Jones. Jones won in the end as many voters unhappy with Trump set aside their concerns.\n\nJones's campaign was upended by revelations he fantasized in 2022 texts about killing a GOP legislative leader and former colleague. He imagined a scenario in which he had two bullets to fire at Adolf Hitler, Cambodian dictator Pol Pot or then-state House Speaker Todd Gilbert.\n\n\"Gilbert, hitler, and pol pot,\" Jones wrote in the texts. \"Gilbert gets two bullets to the head.\"\n\nDemocrats denounced the texts but mostly stood by Jones, hoping that backlash to Trump would pull him over the line anyway. Most Virginia voters disapproved of Trump, and 85 percent of those supported Jones, early exit polls showed. Forty-three percent of voters called Jones' texts disqualifying in early exit polls -- but some said they still voted for him.\n\nIn the governor's race, Spanberger -- a 46-year-old moderate who flipped a competitive U.S. House seat in 2018 -- will be Virginia's first female governor.\n\n\"We sent a message ... We chose our commonwealth over chaos,\" Spanberger said in her victory speech.\n\nIn the lieutenant governor's race, Democrat Ghazala Hashmi became first Muslim candidate elected statewide anywhere in the country. She led Republican nominee John Reid by about 10 points late Tuesday.\n\nTrump repeatedly snubbed Republican gubernatorial nominee Winsome Earle-Sears, 61, who would have been the first Black woman elected governor in any state. The president refused to formally endorse her and avoided saying her name on his election eve telerally for Virginia candidates, focusing instead on GOP Attorney General Jason Miyares, who sought reelection.\n\n\"Get out and vote tomorrow for Jason Miyares, so important -- and Republicans up and down the ballot,\" Trump said.\n\nCalifornia pushes back on Trump\n\nReturn to menu\n\nCalifornia's Prop 50 was voters' clearest opportunity to push back on the Trump administration, and it passed decisively. Democrats put it on the ballot as a counterweight to Trump's unusual effort to draw more Republican-leaning House seats before the 2026 midterms -- ahead of the normal redistricting schedule tied to the Census.\n\nProp 50 asked Californians to temporarily override their independent redistricting commission and draw a House map with five more blue-leaning seats. That's the same number of red-leaning seats Republicans added in Texas this year.\n\nDemocrats, led by California Gov. Gavin Newsom, made the ballot measure fight all about Trump. Adding five Democratic seats could make the difference in their bid to retake control of the House next fall -- though Republicans still have more opportunities nationwide to redraw the maps in their favor.\n\nRepublicans struggled to fight back in a state so opposed to Trump and wound up badly out-raised. Shawn Steel, a Republican National Committee member who was involved in the effort against Prop 50, said the spending gap became \"overwhelming.\"\n\n\"It's like the San Andreas earthquake,\" he said. \"The fault finally opens up, and you see this vast chasm right below your feet, and it's getting wider.\"\n\nYounger voters powered Mamdani\n\nReturn to menu\n\nMamdani, a 34-year-old state lawmaker, was widely expected to win the mayoral race in New York City. But the results give more insight into how Democrats feel about him.\n\nMamdani won two-thirds of voters under 45 in preliminary exit polls, while Cuomo led him by 10 points with voters 45 and older. The polls also showed an education divide: College graduates backed Mamdani by 55 percent, while voters without college degrees narrowly favored Cuomo.\n\nTwo million votes were cast in New York's mayoral race with 15 minutes remaining until the polls closed, according to the New York City Board of Elections, which said this was the first time 2 million New Yorkers voted in local elections since 1969.\n\nMamdani's candidacy has been divisive within the Democratic Party. Hakeem Jeffries, the House Democratic leader from Brooklyn, waited until the last weeks of the race to endorse Mamdani, while Senate Democratic Leader Charles E. Schumer -- another New Yorker -- never backed him. Laura Gillen, a Democrat from a battleground House district in the state, called him \"unfit\" after he declined to say that Hamas, the Gaza-based militant group, should disarm.\n\nOther Democrats have rallied behind Mamdani as a compelling new voice in a party struggling to excite its voters. They praised his focus on voters' economic struggles -- even as some disagreed with his solutions, such as government-run grocery stores -- and his creative use of social media.\n\nRepublicans see Mamdani's Democratic socialism as a valuable foil and are eager to make him the face of the Democratic brand. Trump has called Mamdani \"one of the best things to ever happen to our great Republican Party\" and threatened him with \"problems with Washington like no Mayor in the history of our once great city.\"\n\nMamdani's victory sets up a likely showdown with Trump. The night before the election, the president encouraged New Yorkers to vote for Cuomo and said that if Mamdani wins, \"it is highly unlikely that I will be contributing Federal Funds, other than the very minimum as required, to my beloved first home.\"\n\nBroad signs of trouble for Trump, Republicans\n\nReturn to menu\n\nDemocrats tried to make the election a referendum on Trump and hope that strategy will serve them well in the midterms, too. Republicans, anticipating a tough night, argued even before the results that it was hard to draw conclusions.\n\nMost Virginia and New Jersey voters disapproved of Trump and at least 9 in 10 of those people supported Democratic candidates for governor, exit polls showed. In the Virginia governor's race, about twice as many voters said their choice was meant to oppose Trump as the share who said their choice was meant to support Trump.\n\nOne encouraging sign for Democrats: They appeared to fare far better with voters of color than they did in last year's presidential election, when Trump won close to half of Latino voters and roughly doubled his support among Black voters to 15 percent.\n\nSherrill on Tuesday won more than 90 percent of Black voters and led by more than 30 points with Latino voters in preliminary CNN exit polling. Spanberger posted similar numbers.\n\nStrategists were watching New Jersey's Passaic County, a once-blue area with a large Latino population that flipped to Trump last year. Sherrill led comfortably late Tuesday with most of the vote counted.\n\nTheodoric Meyer, Alec Dent and Scott Clement contributed to this report.",

        "description": "The amendment, also known as the Election Rigging Response Act, was introduced back in August\n\nCalifornians voted in favor of Proposition 50, an amendment that allows temporary changes to Congressional district maps as a response to partisan redistricting in Texas.\n\nCNN and AP News called in favor of the ballot measure at 8 p.m. PT on Tuesday, right as polls closed in the Golden State.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom championed Prop. 50 at length heading into Election Day, repeatedly noting it was the best way to combat President Trump's power grab in Texas, where similar gerrymandering tactics have been executed.\n\n\"California and Californians have been uniquely targeted by the Trump Administration, and we are not going to sit idle while they command Texas and other states to rig the next election to keep power -- pursuing more extreme and unpopular policies,\" the governor noted back in August. \"This proposal would give Californians a choice to fight back -- and bring much needed accountability and oversight to the Trump Administration.\"\n\nNewsom and other California leaders have touted Prop. 50 as a \"direct response\" to Texas redrawing Congressional district lines, giving them five more seats in the U.S. House of Representatives. Per the CADem site, \"Proposition 50 proposes new lines for many of California's 52 congressional districts, which would negate the five Republican seats drawn by Texas.\"\n\nAnd so, Prop. 50 cancels out Texas' newly acquired seats, helping Democrats tackle the Trump administration's MAGA agenda head on.\n\nIn addition to Newsom, former President Barack Obama, Sen. Alex Padilla, Sen. Adam Schiff, Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez all endorsed the proposition before Election Day.\n\nYet -- in addition to President Trump and Vice President JD Vance -- former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger voiced his disapproval of Prop. 50, calling it \"a big scam.\"\n\nDuring an appearance on \"Real Time With Bill Maher\" last month, Schwarzenegger accused Prop. 50 of ripping \"away the power that the people in California have\" and giving \"it back to the politicians.\"\n\n\"We fought that for too long. Let's not do that,\" he said at the time. \"Let's be a good example. Let the Democrats outperform the Republicans, and therefore, because of their performance, win and get the House back.\"",

REUTERS/Mike Blake\n\nCalifornia voters handed Democrats yet another victory on an already action-packed election night, passing Proposition 50.\n\nThe ballot measure, passed and championed by Gov. Gavin Newsom, is a response to President Donald Trump's push for GOP-controlled states to rig their congressional district maps to give themselves extra seats and eliminate Democratic representatives -- plans which have already been passed in Texas, Missouri, and North Carolina.\n\nUnder Proposition 50, the state's nonpartisan redistricting commission is temporarily suspended until the next Census, and a map is passed that seeks to eliminate five Republican congressional districts in California.\n\nThe measure was supported by a number of lawmakers and groups that generally oppose partisan gerrymandering, as an emergency measure to prevent Republicans from being able to block voters from voting out their majority in next year's midterm elections.",

        "title": "How Newsom and allies delivered a redistricting counterpunch against Trump",
        "description": "Democratic officials in Washington and Texas wanted Gavin Newsom's help.\n\nThey reached out to the California governor's team in early July to ask if he could use his growing social media megaphone to push back on President Donald Trump and Texas Republicans, who were barreling toward redrawing the congressional map to their advantage. Newsom was happy to oblige.\n\nCalifornia \"could gerrymander like no other state,\" Newsom said July 9 as he sipped beers with a liberal interviewer on a swing through the South. In a clip of the interview he posted on TikTok, Newsom said he was rethinking the merits of his state's nonpartisan redistricting policy. The next week, after Trump briefed Texas congressional Republicans on redistricting during a July 15 call, Newsom escalated his threat on social media: \"Two can play this game.\"\n\nBut behind the scenes, Newsom and his Democratic allies had been less self-assured. They had begun exploring their own potential redistricting push, but unlike Texas, California had an independent redistricting commission they would have to get around. In June and July meetings in Sacramento, advisers told the governor he would likely need voters' approval for any change to the maps and would need to raise $100 million. The Democrats' chief mapmaker wasn't sure if drawing new lines could yield as many as five new Democratic seats to offset GOP gains in Texas -- or whether Democratic members of Congress would sign off.\n\n\"We didn't know that it was actually achievable,\" said Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-California), the chair of the California Democratic Congressional Delegation. But \"we didn't have the luxury to do anything else but focus.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, their efforts, and the risks they assumed, paid off as California voters approved Newsom's new map, Proposition 50, in a special election, the Associated Press projected. The Democratic victory marks a concrete response to Trump's political agenda less than a year into his second term. It gives Newsom, who many Democrats expect to run for president in 2028, a signature achievement to campaign on and a massive small-dollar fundraising list to tap. And it offers a party looking for ways to fight Trump's agenda a blue state road map for challenging him.\n\nThe nationwide redistricting battle is ongoing, with Trump-led efforts in other red states giving Republicans confidence about seizing an advantage when the dust settles. Some Democratic-led states are also trying to draw new maps, leaving the final outcome up in the air. The battle for the U.S. House majority is expected to be the marquee competition next year, with both sides looking for any advantage.\n\nCritics decried the governor's plan as a \"Newsom-mander\" and a \"power grab\" from political leaders who walked away from their onetime support of redistricting. Republicans were still drawing attention to the political risks for Newsom in the final hours before polls closed, with Rep. Doug LaMalfa (California) urging voters in video posted by the state Republican Party they should try to \"stop Newsom and his aspirations\" at the ballot box.\n\nThis story is based on more than two dozen interviews with members of Congress, congressional and political aides and Newsom advisers and confidants, many of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private conversations. Newsom declined to be interviewed.\n\n\"Ultimately it was the governor's call,\" said Jim DeBoo, a top Newsom strategist who managed the \"Yes on 50\" ballot campaign. \"It had to be a unified decision. In a situation like that, there can't be a lot of dissension. People have to jump off the proverbial cliff together.\"\n\nTexts, Zooms and a Trump-centric strategy\n\nIn the late spring, word was spreading around the Texas Capitol and in Democratic circles that Republicans were planning to redraw their congressional map. Texas Democrats reached out to Lofgren and House Democratic Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar (California) asking if their state was capable of a counter to the president's unprecedented mid-decade redistricting push.\n\nThey both called their redistricting expert, Paul Mitchell, who told them the idea was a nonstarter. Past legal precedent, he said, would make it futile to pursue any kind of mid-decade map drawing in the legislature and there was no reason to think voters would give up their popular nonpartisan commission.\n\nBut the conversation changed in July as the governor and California members began to feel a greater sense of urgency to counter the Trump-led efforts. Newsom's team began private research and polling to assess whether California voters would be willing to give up their independent process. They found that at least a narrow majority of Californians would back a ballot initiative changing the system if it was framed as a check on Trump's power -- a number that had potential to grow.\n\nIn late July and August, as they were still hashing out strategy behind the scenes, Newsom began promoting the argument. His team had built strong relationships with Democratic creators and social media influencers during the January fires and Trump's troop deployments in Los Angeles. Now, they were working closely with them to spread Newsom's message about Trump's moves in Texas to their millions of followers and viewers.\n\nThe strategy also enabled Newsom to nationalize the appeal at a time when Democratic activists and donors were desperate for a concrete way to fight Trump, ultimately helping him raise more than $38 million through 1.2 million donations from donors in all 50 states.\n\nIn private, Newsom involved himself in calls, texts and Zoom meetings with key California congressional Democrats -- Lofgren, former House speaker Nancy Pelosi and Aguilar, as well as the leaders of the California Senate and Assembly -- in late July and early August to shape strategy.\n\nHe sought advice from former president Barack Obama and Obama's attorney general, Eric Holder, who had both championed nonpartisan redistricting. He also consulted with House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (New York).\n\nJeffries and Newsom spoke by phone in mid-July, with the Democratic leader calling to thank Newsom for stating publicly that California was keeping all options on the table, an exchange that began what Jeffries described as \"an ongoing conversation.\" Around that same time, Jeffries made a public entrance to a private meeting of the California delegation -- conferring with Pelosi in full view of reporters.\n\n\"We understood that the first step was to try to get unanimity with the entire California congressional delegation, which is the largest in the country, and that's not an easy thing to achieve,\" Jeffries said. \"There's nothing more personal than people's districts.\"\n\nAt the delegation's meeting and on subsequent Zoom calls, members pressed Pelosi, the Democrats' most prodigious fundraiser, about whether they could raise more than $100 million that might be needed to win a California ballot campaign, which has no limits on contributions.\n\n\"We can raise the money, because we have to,\" Pelosi told them, according to several members.\n\nMap-drawing over 'chicken nuggets and Diet Coke'\n\nNewsom and his advisers worried that trying to engage voters on a subject as arcane as redistricting was a potential loser, particularly because California voters have tended to vote \"no\" if they are confused about a ballot measure. The governor also was not comfortable with abandoning the idea of California's nonpartisan redistricting commission, which he and many of the Democratic members of Congress had long supported. He and his advisers decided to present the measure as a temporary suspension of the independent redistricting commission's maps for three election cycles, hoping to mute critics.\n\nAt a meeting in late July, Democratic members of California's congressional delegation tapped Lofgren and Aguilar to pursue what was possible with the maps and whether they could forge consensus.\n\nMitchell, their chief redistricting expert, abandoned his plans for a vacation in Italy. He drove his wife and daughter to the airport, \"and I came home and got on a Zoom and didn't get off Zooms until two and a half weeks later,\" he said.\n\nThe tedious line drawing process unfolded over that period, including a day when Mitchell did 18 Zoom calls. While on the video calls with individual members -- and often Lofgren and Aguilar -- Mitchell looked at multiple monitors in front of him including a screen where he could see his staff redrawing the lines in real time as he discussed the changes with the members.\n\nEach change to one district created a domino effect of changes to others, requiring additional consultations with the members. Mitchell tapped a staff member in London to continue the mapping work at night while he and his colleagues slept.\n\nLofgren recalled joining video calls from 8 a.m. to midnight one day. Juggling other congressional and district business, Aguilar had his wife drive him around so he could be in the passenger seat on a laptop and he called into one Zoom at 1 a.m. from a delegation trip to Israel. Mitchell, who normally rides his bike 150 miles a week, barely made it outside and said he survived on \"chicken nuggets and Diet Coke.\" To prevent leaks, Mitchell only showed members and their staffs their portion of the map -- to prevent the overall map from becoming public before it was done.\n\nBy early August, the elements of what Pelosi described as a \"three-pillared approach\" were coming together. Democratic members of Congress had signed off on the new maps. California Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas and Senate Democratic leader Mike McGuire and other bill authors were drafting the legislation that they would introduce to set the ballot measure as soon as lawmakers returned to Sacramento on Aug. 18. On Aug. 21, both chambers passed the new map and accompanying legislation. Newsom quickly signed it into law, setting the election for Nov. 4.\n\nAn off-year campaign sprint\n\nAs soon as the legislation was signed, Pelosi, Newsom, Jeffries and other members began to push big donors, labor groups and Democratic organizations to start cutting checks -- sometimes for as much as $5 million. After forming the main campaign committee backing the ballot initiative, Newsom seeded the group with an initial $2.6 million from his own campaign accounts and he urged other donors to do at least as much.\n\nMany donors had been slow to give to Democratic causes, feeling burned by their party's steep losses in the 2024 campaign and others were skittish about giving at a moment when Trump has been so punitive toward his adversaries. But Pelosi, Newsom and Jeffries all argued in their fundraising calls that contributing to the ballot measure campaign wasn't just a one-time contribution. It would lay the foundation for Democrats to retake the majority in 2026, they argued.\n\n\"One of the things I said to all of them, was -- I don't want a win. I want a big win,\" Pelosi said.\n\nThe Trump administration, perhaps inadvertently, helped bring national attention to the Aug. 14 launch of Newsom's ballot measure campaign at the Democracy Center at the Japanese American National Museum in downtown Los Angeles when dozens of Border Patrol officers showed up outside the event. Clips of armed agents milling around outside the governor's event went viral, creating greater awareness about his Prop 50 campaign and juicing his fundraising effort.\n\nAt the outset, it appeared Newsom's ballot campaign was going to face a well-funded opposition. Stanford physicist Charles Munger Jr., a Berkshire Hathaway heir who had bankrolled the earlier ballot measures creating California's independent redistricting process, immediately announced that he would fight Newsom's effort. He wrote three $10 million checks in rapid sequence -- allowing his team to push out mail and immediately get up on the air with ads charging that Newsom's ballot measure would give power to the politicians.\n\nFormer House speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-California) and former California Republican Party chair Jessica Millan Patterson launched their own committee opposing Newsom's measure that was more explicitly aligned with Trump.\n\nBut the big spending some Republicans hoped to see never arrived. One hurdle they faced was skepticism among Republican donors that they could be successful in a state as blue as California at a moment of peak Democratic anger about Trump and his policies, according to two people familiar with the fundraising effort.\n\nTrump kept his distance from the contest, even as his political team worked closely with the Congressional Leadership Fund, the outside group aligned with House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-Louisiana), to help raise $25 million that was directed both to the McCarthy-aligned committee as well as the California Republican Party, which was overseeing the turnout operation. Late in the campaign, Trump posted on Truth Social to try to discredit the California vote, without presenting evidence for his claims.\n\nSome Republicans in California said they were privately frustrated by what they saw as an unfocused, disorganized opposition effort and campaign ads \"that looked like they were straight out of the 1980s,\" as one California GOP strategist put it.\n\n\"This was absolutely winnable,\" said Carl DeMaio, a Republican member of the California State Assembly. \"The Democrats messaging was simplified, emotional and very sharp. Our side basically went with a civics lesson approach.\"\n\nSeveral weeks before the election, public polling showed Newsom's side opening a clear lead. And in October -- at a moment when the state's 23 million voters had gotten their ballots -- data from AdImpact showed that the \"no\" side had gone dark on broadcast, cable and satellite and had no major ad buys reserved for the final weeks of the campaign.\n\nThe Newsom side saw Obama as their most effective surrogate and the ad he filmed stating that democracy is on the ballot Nov. 4 and that Republicans were trying to \"rig the next election and wield unchecked power,\" ran in heavier rotation than any other spot.\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump made it clear that the Nov. 4 election would not be the final phase of the battle. He called the redistricting vote in California \"a GIANT SCAM,\" adding that the measure and election results were \"under very serious legal and criminal review.\"\n\n\"STAY TUNED,\" he wrote.\n\nFor the last 11 weeks, Trump \"intentionally kept a low profile,\" said one person familiar with the president's strategy, but litigation is all but certain to follow: \"It's not over on Election Day.\"\n\nNewsom responded to Trump on social media Tuesday. \"The ramblings of an old man that knows he's about to LOSE,\" he wrote on X.",

Gavin Newsom's Prop 50, which some criticize as gerrymandering, and the upcoming Pennsylvania Supreme court justice retention vote.\n\nCalifornia voters have passed a ballot initiative that will have a huge impact on next year's battle for the U.S. House majority.\n\nAccording to the Fox News Decision Desk, voters in California approved Proposition 50, which would dramatically alter the state's congressional districts, putting the left-leaning state front-and-center in the high-stakes political fight over redistricting that pits President Donald Trump and the GOP against the Democrats.\n\nApproval of the ballot initiative in the nation's most populous state will temporarily sidetrack California's nonpartisan redistricting commission and return the power to draw the congressional maps to the Democrat-dominated legislature.\n\nThe effort in California, which could create five more Democratic-leaning congressional districts, aims to counter the passage in the reliable red state of Texas of a new map that aims to create up to five right-leaning House seats.

The new map in Missouri is likely to give the GOP another right-leaning seat.\n\nAnd North Carolina's Republican-controlled legislature also passed a new map which is likely to score another congressional seat for the GOP. Republican-controlled Indiana is on deck, with a special legislative session getting underway this week.\n\nBut unlike those states, California voters needed to weigh in before giving redistricting power back to the legislature in Sacramento.\n\n\"Heaven help us if we lose,\" Newsom said in a fundraising pitch. \"This is an all-hands-on-deck moment for Democrats.\"\n\nFIVE KEY 2025 RACES TO WATCH\n\nProponents and opponents of Proposition 50 raised hundreds of millions of dollars in fundraising, with much of the money being dished out to pay for a deluge of ads on both sides.\n\nOne of the two main groups countering Newsom and the Democrats labeled their effort \"Stop Sacramento's Power Grab.\"\n\nGetting into the fight was former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, who was the last Republican governor of California.\n\nDuring his tenure as governor, Schwarzenegger had a starring role in the passage of constitutional amendments in California in 2008 and 2010 that took the power to draw state legislative and congressional districts away from politicians and placed it in the hands of an independent commission.\n\nNORTHERN CALIFORNIA VOTERS WEIGH IN ON PROP 50 REDISTRICTING FIGHT\n\n\"That's what they want to do is take us backwards -- this is why it is important for you to vote no on Prop 50,\" Schwarzenegger said in an ad against Proposition 50. \"Democracy -- we've got to protect it, and we've got to go and fight for it.\"\n\nBut as Election Day neared in California, the Yes forces had dramatically outraised the No forces, and public opinion polling indicated majority support for the proposition.\n\nEven before Trump initiated his redistricting push, Ohio was under court order to redraw its maps. That could boost Republicans in a one-time battleground state that now leans right.\n\nRepublicans in GOP-dominated Florida are also mulling congressional redistricting. And Democrats in heavily blue Maryland are weighing a redistricting push, while the Democrat-controlled legislature in Virginia is already pushing redistricting.\n\nCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nOther states considering altering their maps are Democrat-dominated Illinois and red states Kansas and Nebraska.\n\nMeanwhile, Democrats could possibly pick up a seat in Republican-dominated Utah, due to a new, more competitive map, mandated by a judge.",

        "description": "California Gov. Gavin Newsom's costly Prop 50 vanity project coasted to victory Tuesday, paving the way for Democrats to flip five crucial congressional seats in the 2026 midterms.\n\nThe Associated Press called the results promptly at 8 p.m. local time, right when polls closed.\n\nThe partisan measure, spearheaded by Newsom, was introduced by the Democratic-led Legislature in direct response to GOP-driven redistricting in Texas that also aims at gaining five additional congressional seats.\n\nThe possibility of losing five seats would be a major blow for California Republicans, who currently hold only nine of the state's 52 congressional seats.\n\nTuesday's tit-for-tat special election has been highly publicized and criticized for its cost, as it's estimated to cost taxpayers over $200 million, at a time when the state is already under great fiscal pressure.\n\nCost aside, Newsom still got plenty of support for Prop 50 from his famous Dem friends. Former President Barack Obama and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez both appeared on ad campaigns pushing the initiative to the state's nearly 40 million people. Former Vice President Kamala Harris also pushed Prop 50.\n\n\"Republicans want to steal enough seats in Congress to rig the next election and wield unchecked power for two more years,\" Obama said in one ad. \"You can stop Republicans in their tracks.\"\n\nFormer California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger railed against Prop 50, telling CNN's Jake Tapper, \"Texas started it. They did something terribly wrong. And then all of a sudden, California says, 'Well, then we have to do something terribly wrong.' And then now other states are jumping in.\"\n\nThe former \"Governator\" said Prop 50 would \"take the power away from the people.\"\n\nThe drawing of electoral maps within the state is now in the hands of the California Legislature, suspending an independent body -- the California Citizens Redistricting Commission (CRC) -- until after the 2030 US Census.\n\nThe newly proposed lines will edge out conservative-leaning districts in the north and south of the state, and split more cities and counties among three or more districts in contrast to only two.\n\nOpponents of the redistricting argue fairness when it comes to representation in minority communities, but the new map won't jeopardize minority votes, according to an analysis by the Public Policy Institute of California.\n\nThe maps may aid in flipping Democratic seats in the House come the 2026 midterms and complicate President Trump's Republican agenda moving forward. Dems need to gain three seats in the midterms to take control of the House.\n\nThis is a political win for Newsom, who staunchly backed the proposition as a flex to go toe to toe with Trump amid speculation that he's eyeing a 2028 presidential bid.",

        "title": "California Approves New House Maps in a Major Win for Democrats and Newsom",
        "description": "California voters agreed Tuesday to aggressively redraw the state's congressional district lines to wipe out as many as five Republican seats, according to The Associated Press, delivering a major victory for national Democrats hoping to wrest control of the House of Representatives in 2026.\n\nGavin Newsom, the state's Democratic governor, had championed the ballot measure, successfully selling it as an emergency response to President Trump's efforts to press Republican states across the country to redraw their own boundaries for political advantage.\n\nIt's now possible that Democrats could hold as many as 48 of California's 52 seats after 2026, up from the party's current 43 seats.\n\nRedistricting wars have spread nationwide since the summer, when Republicans carved as many as five new congressional seats for the party in Texas. The passage of new maps in California represents the first and most significant swing back in favor of Democrats.\n\nRepublicans currently hold a mere three-seat majority in the House, and control of the chamber is the Democratic Party's best chance to take any power in Washington next year and thus thwart Mr. Trump's agenda in the second half of his second term.\n\nMr. Newsom and a parade of national Democrats had pitched the redistricting measure as a necessary maneuver by the left to counteract Mr. Trump's bending of the typical rules of political engagement. They called it the Election Rigging Response Act, purposefully naming it Proposition 50 in reference to the 50 U.S. states, symbolizing the nationwide scope of the fight.\n\nBut even more than that, Mr. Newsom aimed to turn the redistricting campaign into more of a partisan referendum on Mr. Trump than on gerrymandering, successfully taking advantage of California's political tilt to the left.\n\nThere are now legal, legislative and political fights over redistricting in more than a half-dozen states, including Indiana, Virginia, New York, Ohio, North Carolina, Missouri, Illinois and Florida.\n\nCongressional maps are typically reconfigured each decade, only after the census. But Mr. Trump has pushed Republican-controlled states to adopt partisan new maps that erase Democratic seats this year to improve Republican chances to keep power in the House. He has succeeded so far in Missouri, Texas and North Carolina. Democrats control fewer statehouses, and in some of those places, including California, they had previously ceded mapmaking authority.\n\nMore than a decade ago, California voters had stripped politicians of partisan mapmaking powers, handing control to an independent citizens commission. But Mr. Newsom persuaded state legislators in Sacramento this summer -- and ultimately the public on Tuesday -- to roll back those reforms. Voters agreed to rewrite the California Constitution, installing the heavily gerrymandered maps favoring Democrats until the next census in order to offset congressional Republican gains elsewhere.\n\nSupporters of the independent commission lamented the outcome, saying it was a mistake for the state to revert to partisan map-drawing after embracing a reform that created more competitive races.\n\n\"For what looms for the people of California, I am saddened by the passage of Proposition 50,\" Charles T. Munger Jr., a longtime champion of independent redistricting and the largest donor against the measure.\n\nMr. Munger, a Republican, added that Californians must ensure that the state will revert to having maps drawn by its independent commission after the 2030 census.\n\nMr. Newsom raised more than $100 million in three months for a campaign that cemented his status as one of the nation's leading antagonists to Mr. Trump, and his position as a serious potential Democratic presidential contender in 2028.\n\nHis office's all-caps social media posts that mocked Mr. Trump's caustic style with dripping sarcasm went viral. And Mr. Newsom's full embrace of battling -- and baiting -- Mr. Trump became a comforting salve for a Democratic base that has been crying out for a more full-throated response to a president seen by the left as fraying the basic fabric of democracy.\n\nEarly on, the redistricting ballot fight was expected to be highly competitive.\n\nMr. Munger, a physicist and heir to a business fortune who had supported the initial redistricting reforms in the state, poured more than $30 million into stopping Mr. Newsom. But his donations mostly dried up soon after Labor Day, and so did other funding against the measure.\n\nFormer Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican who had counted stripping politicians of their map-drawing powers as one of his administration's major accomplishments, publicly spoke out against the measure but did little else to mobilize opposition.\n\nBy October, Mr. Newsom and his allies mostly had the airwaves to themselves in a state where television ads are still king. All told, proponents spent roughly $99 million on advertising online and on television compared with nearly $39 million in opposition, according to data from AdImpact, an ad-tracking service.\n\nThe one-sided deluge caused Mr. Newsom to tell small donors to stop giving any more money more than a week before the election, an unusual declaration that showed how confident his team had become.\n\nThe closing ad in support of Proposition 50 distilled much of the strategy from Mr. Newsom's team: rallying Democrats to the polls in a Democratic state to stand up to Mr. Trump.\n\nIt featured former President Barack Obama, Mr. Newsom, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and even Representative Jasmine Crockett of Texas, a firebrand who has become a favorite of the progressive base.\n\nThe new maps approved by voters will significantly scramble California's congressional delegation, which is the nation's largest, with 52 members.\n\nFor three Republicans -- Representatives Kevin Kiley and Doug LaMalfa in Northern California, and Representative Ken Calvert in Southern California -- the political complexion of their districts has completely changed from safe Republican redoubts to relative Democratic strongholds.\n\nThe districts of two other Republicans, Representatives David Valadao in the Central Valley and Darrell Issa in Southern California, will become more competitive seats that Democrats hope to flip.\n\nBut all of that does not capture how thoroughly the new map favors Democrats.\n\nThe new lines also simultaneously strengthened the party's position in a half-dozen other potentially competitive seats held by Democrats: Representatives George Whitesides, Mike Levin, Dave Min, Derek Tran, Adam Gray and Josh Harder.\n\nThe new congressional lines approved under Proposition 50 will be in place for elections in 2026, 2028 and 2030. After the next census, California's independent redistricting commission will again be charged with drawing the state's maps.",

        "description": "The proposition marks Democrats' first foray into what some have described as the \"redistricting arms race,\" as both parties gear up for 2026.\n\nVoters in California have given Gov. Gavin Newsom the green light to redraw the state's congressional maps ahead of next year's midterm elections.\n\nNBC News' Decision Desk projected resounding approval for Proposition 50, which will allow the state to temporarily scrap its independent redistricting commission and use a more Democratic-friendly congressional map in 2026.\n\nThe measure, which was put on the ballot in August, was a direct response to Donald Trump's efforts to redraw congressional maps in his party's favor in several Republican-controlled states across the country. Democrats in California are expected to net five additional seats in the House next year to counter the five seats Republicans are likely to gain in Texas.\n\nBefore Tuesday's vote, Newsom accused Trump of \"rigging the game,\" and said this was his state's chance to \"fight fire with fire.\"\n\nUnder Newsom's plan, Democrats could control as many as 48 of the state's 52 congressional seats -- up from the 43 seats the party currently holds.\n\nProposition 50's passage marks Democrats' first foray into what some have described as the \"redistricting arms race,\" as both parties seek to improve their electoral chances ahead of 2026.\n\nThe proposition was backed by several high-profile Democrats, including former President Barack Obama and former Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nIn one ad, the former president said the legislation would put \"our elections back on a level playing field,\" and told Californians they had the power to \"stop Republicans in their tracks.\"\n\nTypically, states commission new congressional maps every 10 years using U.S. census data. The last set of maps, drawn in 2020, was expected to be used until 2030.\n\nEarlier this year, at the president's urging, Republicans in several states started that process in the middle of the decade in an effort to defend the party's razor-thin majority in the House.\n\nTrump's push began in Texas in July, when he asked Republicans to schedule a special session to consider new maps.\n\nAfter a high-profile fight with the state's Democrats, which included dozens of lawmakers leaving Texas in protest, Republicans passed the gerrymandered maps and Gov. Greg Abbott signed off on the legislation in August.\n\nTrump then expanded his pressure campaign to other states, with Missouri and North Carolina following Texas' lead. Indiana is set to convene a special session in December to consider new congressional districts, and Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida has called for a special session to redraw his state's maps.",

        "description": "The illegal immigrant from India who is accused of causing a fatal pile-up in California pleaded not guilty Tuesday to downgraded charges after his blood work reveal he wasn't actually under the influence of drugs or alcohol at the time.\n\nJashanpreet Singh, 21, is accused of causing a collision involving eight vehicles on the westbound 10 Freeway in San Bernardino County last month in an incident that left three people dead and four others injured.\n\nSingh appeared in San Bernardino County Superior Court in Rancho Cucamonga, Calif. Tuesday wearing orange jail scrubs, shackled at his wrists and -- but without his Sikh turban, which he had requested.\n\nHe pleaded not guilty a new complaint to charges of vehicular manslaughter with gross negligence.\n\nAuthorities had initially claimed Singh was under the influence of drugs when he crashed his semi-truck during slow-moving traffic. But prosecutors in San Bernardino have since announced no drugs or alcohol were found in his blood, following testing.\n\nSingh now faces three counts of vehicular manslaughter with gross negligence and reckless driving, after the prior charges of vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated and driving under the influence were dropped, according to an amended criminal complaint.\n\nSingh had faced up to 17 years behind bars under the prior more serious charges. He now faces up to 10 years if convicted.\n\nThe judge denied his renewed request for bail and set his next court date for Thursday when Singh can make a motion for permission to wear his religious head covering in court.\n\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement have issued a formal request for local law enforcement to notify ICE before Singh is released, as he's believed to have entered the US illegally in 2022 via the southern border before he was allowed into the country by the Biden administration, according to the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nHarrowing dashcam footage captured the red tractor-trailer plowing into several cars in one lane and smashing them to bits before colliding into the back of a white truck. At least eight cars were involved in the crash.\n\nAll westbound lanes were shut down for hours while the disaster was investigated.\n\nA few days later, the Department of Transportation released a report blaming California Gov. Gavin Newsom's administration for allegedly unlawfully upgrading Singh's license after a law passed weeks prior preventing illegal immigrants from holding commercial driver's licenses.\n\nThe law went into effect on Sept. 26, while Singh's driving rights were upgraded from a restricted Commercial Driver's License, which allowed him to drive a commercial truck only within the Golden State, to an expanded CDL on Oct. 15, the report claims.\n\nThe victims were identified as Fontana couple Clarence and Lisa Nelson, ages 76 and 69, and Jaime Flores Garcia, 54, of Upland, according to a report by the Rancho Cucamonga Daily Bulletin.\n\nTwo GOP lawmakers Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) and Rep. Andy Barr (R-Ky.) last week called on the Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy to look into the programs that approve CDLs following Singh's crash and another collision by an illegal immigrant also from India, Harjinder Singh.\n\nHarjinder Singh is also accused of killing three people, after he pulled an illegal U-turn with an 18-wheeler through an \"Official Use Only\" zone, colliding with a van in Fort Pierce, Fla. on Aug. 12.\n\nHarjinder Singh had been driving with a California issued CDL. He faces vehicular homicide charges and immigration violations for allegedly illegally entering the US in 2018.",

        "title": "'He's not engaged': Steve Bannon pre-blames Trump for GOP election losses",
        "description": "U.S. President Donald Trump speaks to members of the media as he arrives at the White House in Washington, D.C. on Oct. 5, 2025. REUTERS/Aaron Schwartz\n\nSteve Bannon, MAGA strategist and longtime ally of President Donald Trump, called out the president on Tuesday saying \"he's not engaged\" and blaming him for GOP election losses before the official results are in.\n\nIn a conversation with conservative commentator Eric Bolling on his \"War Room\" podcast, Bannon recommended Trump should have the Department of Justice officials on a plane to California to try and \"talk about the unconstitutionality of what they did in California\" in response to Gov. Gavin Newsom's move to redistrict House seats under Prop. 50 after Trump demanded more Republican House seats in Texas.\n\nBannon said there is a common theme among Republicans who are expected to face a challenge from Democratic rivals in their elections.\n\n\"They think Trump's a passing summer storm... the Republican establishment hates Trump. They've had no engagement in Trump in any of these elections. He wasn't engaged in New Jersey. He's not engaged in the commonwealth of Virginia. He's not engaged in New York City. He's not engaged in California,\" Bannon said.\n\nThey use Trump to build momentum, he argued, and that it hasn't worked.\n\n\"He just won the greatest political comeback in history,\" Bannon said.\n\nIn California, where Prop. 50 is expected to draw a substantial turnout, it will likely not be positioned in the president's favor, he said.\n\n\"That thing could be over the moment the polls close,\" Bannon said.\n\nBannon argued that Trump should be more forceful than he's been over the last nine months, especially amid the government shutdown and his pushback to fund SNAP benefits.\n\n\"You can't bend to the Democrats... I think we need Trump and we need harder Trump,\" he added. \"How 'bout this? Suck on this. Give 'em Trump and MAGA -- Trumpism, full unvarnished. Let's roll.\"\n\n\"You're gonna see tonight, when they all talked him out of getting involved and all the campaigns in those states, you know, Winsome [Earle]-Sears and [Glenn] Youngkin... they couldn't be bothered for four years to implement any MAGA programs. They couldn't be bothered to have Trump down there,\" he said.\n\nBannon called Sears \"the worst\" and a \"never Trumper\" who should have been more grateful to the president.\n\n\"What you're going to get tonight is you're going to get to the Republican party without Trump... And people think you're going to get these low propensity, low information voters without Trump, you're kidding yourselves,\" he added.\n\nBannon continued by saying \"Trump 2028, show me what you got...\"",

        "title": "California voters take up Prop 50, a Democratic push for more U.S. House seats",
        "description": "LOS ANGELES -- The national battle to control the U.S. House shifts to California on Tuesday as voters consider a Democratic proposal that could erase as many as five Republican districts and blunt President Donald Trump's moves to safeguard his party's lock on Washington power.\n\nThe outcome will reverberate into next year's midterm elections and beyond, with Democrats hoping a victory will set the stage for the party to regain control of the House in 2026. A shift in the majority would imperil Trump's agenda for the remainder of his term at a time of deep partisan divisions over immigration, health care and the future direction of the nation.\n\n\"God help us if we lose in California,\" Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom says.\n\nDemocrats need to gain just three seats in the 2026 elections to take control of the House.\n\nHeavily Democratic California and its 52 congressional districts represent by far the Democrats' best opportunity in an unprecedented state-by-state redistricting battle, which started when Texas Republicans heeded Trump's demand that they redraw their boundaries to help the GOP retain its House majority. Democrats hold 43 of the state's seats and hope to boost that to 48.\n\nTrump is fighting not just the Democrats but history. Midterm elections typically punish the party in the White House, but four GOP-led states so far have adopted new district maps to pack more Republican voters into key districts.\n\nCalifornia's Proposition 50 asks voters to suspend House maps drawn by an independent commission and replace them with rejiggered districts adopted by the Democratic-controlled Legislature. Those new districts would be in place for the 2026, 2028 and 2030 elections.\n\nThe recast districts aim to dilute Republican voters' power, in one case by uniting rural, conservative-leaning parts of far northern California with Marin County, a famously liberal coastal stronghold across the Golden Gate Bridge from San Francisco.\n\nThe measure has been spearheaded by Newsom, who has thrown the weight of his political operation behind it in a major test of his mettle ahead of a potential 2028 presidential campaign. Former President Barack Obama has urged voters to pass it as well.\n\nNewsom has sought to nationalize the campaign, depicting the proposal as a counterweight to all things Trump.\n\n\"Republicans want to steal enough seats in Congress to rig the next election and wield unchecked power for two more years,\" Obama says in one ad. \"You can stop Republicans in their tracks.\"\n\nCritics say two wrongs don't make a right. They urge Californians to reject what they call a Democratic power grab, even if they have misgivings about Trump's moves in Republican-led states.\n\nAmong the most prominent critics is Arnold Schwarzenegger, the movie star and former Republican governor who pushed for the creation of the independent commission, which voters approved in 2008 and 2010. It makes no sense to fight Trump by becoming him, Schwarzenegger said in September, arguing that the proposal would \"take the power away from the people.\"\n\nAfter an early burst of TV advertising, opponents of the plan have struggled to raise cash in a state with some of the nation's most expensive media markets. Data compiled by advertising tracker AdImpact last week showed Democrats and other supporters with over $5 million in ad buys booked on broadcast TV, cable and radio. But opponents had virtually no time reserved, though the data didn't include some popular streaming services like Hulu and YouTube or mail advertising.\n\nTotal spending on broadcast and cable ads topped $100 million, with more than two-thirds of it coming from supporters. Newsom told people to stop donating in the race's final weeks.\n\nTrump, who overwhelmingly lost California in his three presidential campaigns, largely stayed out of the fray. A week before the election, he urged voters in a social media post not to vote early or by mail - messaging that conflicts with that of top Republicans in the state who urged people to get their ballots in as soon as possible.\n\nDemocrats hope to pick up as many as five seats in California if voters approve the new boundaries, offsetting the five that Republicans hope to pick up through their new Texas maps. Republicans also expect to gain one seat each from new maps in Missouri and North Carolina, and potentially two more in Ohio.\n\nCongressional district boundaries are typically redrawn every 10 years to reflect population shifts documented in the census. Mid-decade redistricting is unusual, absent a court order finding fault with the maps in place.\n\nFive other GOP-led states are also considering new maps: Florida, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana and Nebraska.\n\nOn the Democratic side, Colorado, Illinois, Maryland, New York and Virginia have proposals to redraw maps, but major hurdles remain.\n\nA court has ordered new boundaries be drawn in Utah, where all four House districts are represented by Republicans, but it remains to be seen if the state will approve a map that makes any of them winnable for Democrats.\n\n___\n\nCooper reported from Phoenix and Nguyen from Sacramento, California.",

        "description": "Laurel Rosenhall reported from Sacramento, and Annie Karni from Washington.\n\nSenator Alex Padilla will not run for governor of California next year, he said Tuesday in an emotional announcement at the U.S. Capitol that came as a surprise to many of his state's political insiders.\n\nMr. Padilla, a Democrat, said that he appreciated the encouragement he had received from those who wanted him to run for the state's highest office, but that he felt compelled to remain in the Senate to fight against President Trump's agenda and its effects on California.\n\nWith his wife, Angela, standing by his side, Mr. Padilla recalled when federal agents tackled him in June as he asked a question of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem during a news conference about immigration enforcement in Los Angeles. The episode occurred just days after Mr. Trump sent thousands of National Guard troops and hundreds of Marines to Southern California to quell protests and protect federal agents involved in the crackdown.\n\n\"As alarming as that experience was, not just for me and our family, but for most people who have seen the video, countless people have told me, 'I'm glad you're fighting for us. I'm glad you're there,'\" Mr. Padilla said, his voice choking with emotion.\n\n\"And so it is with a full heart, and even more commitment than ever, that I am choosing to not run for a governor of California next year,\" he added. \"I choose not just to stay in the Senate, I choose to stay in this fight.\"\n\nMr. Padilla had previously said he would wait until after Election Day to announce whether he would run for governor next year. Gov. Gavin Newsom cannot run again because of term limits, and the race is wide open.\n\nBut Mr. Padilla surprised California officials and political experts by making his announcement as voters were still heading to the polls on Tuesday.\n\nHe gave reporters in Washington no warning during a break between news conferences by congressional leaders, and he simply stepped to the podium to read a prepared statement. He then took no questions from reporters.\n\nThis is a developing news story. Please check back for updates.",

In short, Tuesday is the most significant election in the United states since last November, experts say, when President Trump defeated Kamala Harris in the presidential race, and Republicans maintained control of the House and Senate. It's also being viewed as a way to gauge the pulse of voters a year before the 2026 elections, when control of the House, Senate and governor's offices will be up for grabs.\n\n\"Tuesday has become an early referendum on Trump,\" said Larry Gerston, a professor emeritus of political science at San Jose State University. \"There are different states, different turnouts and different issues. But that's the overall theme.\"\n\nA CNN poll Monday showed voters aren't happy. Trump's approval rating was 37% -- the lowest of his second term. A majority of voters said his polices have worsened the economy, hurt America's standing in the world, and that his immigration crackdown has \"gone too far.\" But the same voters had an even lower view of the Democratic Party, giving it just a 29% approval rating.\n\nFive key races to watch Tuesday:\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom's statewide ballot measure, if approved by voters, would redraw California's congressional districts in a way that could cost five Republicans their seats, tilting the state's delegation from the current 43 Democrats and 9 Republicans to 48-4 after next year's elections. Newsom and Sacramento Democrats placed the measure on the ballot after Trump pushed governors in red states, including Texas, to redraw their district lines this year, instead of every 10 years after the Census, as had been the custom, in an attempt to boost Republicans' chances of keeping control of the House of Representatives next year.\n\nIf Democrats win the House in 2026, they could impeach Trump again, haul his cabinet secretaries under oath before investigations, and block funding for everything from new offshore oil drilling to expanded immigration detention centers. Republicans led by former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger -- who worked hard to create California's non-partisan commission that draws district lines -- have fought Prop 50. But Democrats have outraised opponents $122 million to $44 million. Polls show the measure leading in California, a state Trump lost by 20 points last November. If it passes, Newsom's national profile as a 2028 presidential candidate will be boosted.\n\nRepublican Gov. Glenn Youngkin will leave office due to term limits in this purple state. Former congresswoman Abigail Spanberger, a moderate Democrat and former CIA agent who has focused on cost-of-living issues, is running to succeed him against Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, a Trump supporter and former Marine. Spanberger is leading in the polls, particularly as the federal government shutdown has hit Virginia residents hard. Whoever wins will be the first female governor in Virginia history.\n\nA big question mark: Whether Democrat Jay Jones can hang on to beat Republican incumbent Jason Miyares in the attorney general's race. Jones led until last month. But the National Review published text messages Jones sent to a fellow state lawmaker wishing a Republican state leader and his family would die. Jones also was cited in 2022 for driving 116 mph. As part of a plea deal, he performed 500 hours of community service for his own political action committee. His image and poll numbers have suffered.\n\nThe other marquee governor's race Tuesday is in the Garden State, where a close battle is playing out. Democrat Mikie Sherrill, a four-term member of Congress and former Navy helicopter pilot, faces Republican Jack Ciattarelli, a former state Assemblyman who came within 3 points of defeating incumbent Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy in 2021.\n\nA normally reliable blue state that has voted for the Democratic nominee for president in every election since 1992, New Jersey has occasionally elected Republicans as governor, most recently Chris Christie in 2009 and 2013. Sherrill holds a narrow lead in the polls. But Harris only defeated Trump there in November by 5.9%, and Ciattarelli, with Trump's backing and solid fundraising, is looking for a breakthrough win.\n\nThree candidates are vying to run America's most populous city: Former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, 67, a Democrat who won four statewide elections, only to resign his Albany office in 2021 amid sexual harassment allegations; Republican Curtis Sliwa, 71, who founded the Guardian Angels crimefighting group; and state lawmaker Zohran Mamdani, a 34-year-old Democratic Socialist who has built momentum with charismatic speeches, clever social media and promises to raise taxes on billionaires, provide free bus service and a pass a $30 minimum wage. Mamdani, a darling of progressives nationwide, is leading in the polls, even though many traditional Democratic leaders, including Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, have not endorsed him or Cuomo.\n\nFew states are more important in winning the presidency than Pennsylvania. After voting for Obama twice, Keystone State voters shifted to Trump in 2016, embraced Joe Biden in 2020, and veered back to Trump last year, awarding him their 19 electoral votes.\n\nDemocrats hold a 5-2 majority on the state Supreme Court. Three Democratic justices -- David Wecht, Christine Donohue and Kevin Dougherty -- face yes-no retention votes, in which voters will decide whether to keep them on the bench. Republicans are pushing hard to remove them, which would shift the court to a 2-2 tie before elections in 2027 add new members. A deadlocked chamber could have major impacts on the 2028 presidential race if disputes over voting, ballot counting or other elections questions make it to Pennsylvania's highest court.",

        "title": "MAGA's sheer hatred of one man could be the thing that saves us from Trump",
        "description": "A view shows a golden MAGA hat, ahead of a Republican presidential nominee and former U.S. President Donald Trump campaign rally in Gastonia, North Carolina, U.S. November 2, 2024. REUTERS/Megan Varner\n\nIs the No Kings movement the new Tea Party movement?\n\nThat's certainly the opinion of some Never Trump conservatives. In the more than 7 million people who protested against the Trump regime, they see the highest ideals of the Tea Party, chief among them limited government, individual liberty and the sovereignty of the people.\n\nBut that's the thing. Those highest ideals were darkened by the fact that the Tea Party was an artificial construct. It's sometimes called \"astroturf\" to distinguish it from a real, organic grassroots movement.\n\nThe Tea Party was funded by billionaires, conspicuously by the Koch brothers. It may have had the veneer of high-mindedness, but in truth it aimed to spread fear, hate and lies about the first Black president in order to expand and consolidate the power of those self-same elites.\n\nSo no. No Kings is not the new Tea Party if we are talking about the Tea Party in terms of the noblest principles of the American republic.\n\nBecause it wasn't. It was, however, a political movement against elites. In this, No Kings has something in common with the Tea Party.\n\nThe key difference, of course, is that No Kings has the potential to reject the legitimacy of elites generally. The Tea Party wanted us to believe that the \"elites\" were all those wine-and-cheese liberals on the east coast who forced \"real Americans\" to live under the rule of a secret Muslim and covert Marxist by the name of Barack Obama, who was himself a mere puppet of a global conspiracy against America.\n\nThe Tea Party movement was a gigantic shuck and jive - a means of distracting Americans, but especially white Americans who are (um) receptive to such messaging, while actual elites pick their pockets.\n\nWhile No Kings is mainly focused on Donald Trump, it holds the promise of expanding its scope to include all those elites that the Tea Party was intended to serve. Indeed, the circumstances are changing rapidly. No Kings could evolve into a mass movement against oligarchs, which could turn into a mass movement against billionaires, which could turn into a mass movement against the monopoly control that all those billionaires now have over the institutions of democracy.\n\nAnd like the Tea Party, No Kings is emerging from an economic emergency. Back then, it was a crisis of collapsing assets, mainly housing, and how that impacted jobs. The crisis now is much, much greater, as inflation and cost of living affect vastly more people than unemployment ever did. It's so bad that retailers that manage to hold their prices down are being celebrated as champions of the people!\n\nNo Kings is already huge. Its recent one-day march was the biggest in American history. Everyone who is not capable of bribing a president is struggling to pay for the necessities of life. Many of those folks are going to be open to a movement that gives them someone to blame. A protest of seven million-plus people could double before you know it.\n\nDonald Trump looked at the Tea Party and found ways to harness its energy. (He chose \"birtherism,\" because he understood what it was really about.) Ambitious Democrats are surely doing the same regarding No Kings. One of the most ambitious is Gavin Newsom.\n\nIn an interview with ABC's Jonathan Kark, California's governor said we ought to be standing up for the noblest principles of the American republic. \"The founding fathers did not live and die to see us as cowards,\" Newsom said. Then he identified the cowards, broadening the scope of the No Kings movement to include \"the richest, most powerful people selling their souls and selling out this country.\"\n\nHe then implied a list: the Republicans in the Congress, Wall Street and the corporate media, elite universities and elite law firms. Missing was the supermajority of the Supreme Court, but Newsom's message was otherwise clear. Americans should be \"disgusted\" by the \"cowards\" who have monopoly control over the institutions of democracy.\n\nNewsom borrowed from the No Kings by saying that the language of liberty is requisite to fighting for it. \"It's a revolution that's going on in this country and I think you have to start using those words,\" he said. \"[Trump] is attacking every single institution of independent thinking and he's succeeding because we're still playing by the old set of rules.\"\n\n\"The old set of rules\" is hotly debated among liberal folk, but at its root, it refers to a status quo that, by dint of being a status quo, gives certain elites every advantage they could hope for in preventing the Democrats from developing into a fully realized opposition party.\n\nIt means continuing to make room for certain elites who (in good faith, let's say) wish to stop the Democrats from becoming \"too extreme,\" which really means stopping them from centering the interests of the people. Once these are set aside, Newsom suggests, the Democrats can \"fight fire with fire\" for the purpose of establishing a new normal.\n\nThe language of revolutionary freedom in the context of old rules serving elites is important to understanding what Newsom says in the very next breath - that once order is reestablished, \"we will continue to build on the legacy, I would argue, of the former president, who I think was one of the most successful presidents of the last century.\"\n\nHe meant Joe Biden.\n\nFar too few realized Biden was the bridge between the past and the future that so many Americans want to see in their president. His economic policies in particular were transformational, as they reversed the priorities of previous administrations, including Obama's.\n\nBiden privileged workers over \"job creators.\" (He was the first president to cross a picket line.) He oversaw a dramatic increase in hourly wages. (They outpaced inflation for the first time since the 1960s.) Unemployment, especially Black unemployment, had rarely been lower. By the end, inflation was returning to pre-pandemic levels.\n\nFor these reasons and more, elites hated Biden.\n\nThe hatred was especially sharp among corporate bosses. Biden championed their workers. He regulated their industries. He put the national interest above theirs. Most of all, they hated that Joe Biden threatened to stem the tide of consolidation. Capital will concentrate if left alone. Biden didn't leave it alone. He knew that the unchecked concentration of money and power spells doom for democracy.\n\nHe was right. We know he was right. Look what's happening now.\n\nAnd that brings me back to No Kings. It has the potential to clarify history. The conventional wisdom is that Biden, through his hubris, brought himself down, paving the way for Donald Trump's return.\n\nWith enough effort, another story can come to light - that the elites who are now lording it over us, who are now planning to pal around with a criminal president in his new gold-plated \"ballroom,\" conspired against a truly working-man's president. Yes, he was old. Perhaps he overstayed his welcome. But no one can dispute the stone-cold fact that elites across the spectrum attacked him virtually from the start.\n\nAnd from that betrayal of democracy and the common good arose the stirrings of an organic grassroots movement against not only despotic rule but against \"the richest, most powerful people selling their souls and selling out this country\" - those who made despotism possible.Newsom didn't bring up Biden only because he's still popular with the Democratic base. He did so also because he knows that what the former president did is the foundation on which to build the next chapter of American history as well as the",

        "title": "Fox News' Martha MacCallum on Anchoring Election Night, Interviewing Zohran Mamdani: 'It Looks Very Good for Him'",
        "description": "The longtime anchor is leading the network's news coverage of elections in New York, New Jersey, Virginia and California\n\nFox News anchor Martha MacCallum likes to start her day with a run. As the minutes trickle toward the Election Day polls closing, we're in for a sprint.\n\nMacCallum, who anchors the network's afternoon telecast \"The Story,\" is continuing her long-running duties as one of Fox News' election anchors on Tuesday alongside Bret Baier as New York City, New Jersey, Virginia and California residents turn out in historic numbers for an off-cycle election. While CNN and MSNBC are launching large-scale election coverage, starting at 5 p.m. and 7 p.m., respectively, MacCallum and Baier will host an election special from 10-11 p.m. on Tuesday night, preempting Greg Gutfeld's late-night show before \"Fox News @ Night\" anchor Trace Gallagher carries the election coverage from 11 p.m.-1 a.m.\n\nThe interest in this year's off-year cycle has been unusually high as President Donald Trump's policies have dominated the news. Early voting has surged in New Jersey and Virginia, where Democrats are vying to lead both states, and in California for a Democrat-backed voting measure to redraw its congressional maps.\n\nMeanwhile, New York City saw more people vote early in-person this election cycle than in any other nonpresidential election as Zohran Mamdani seeks to fend off Andrew Cuomo and Curtis Silwa to become the first Democratic socialist mayor in the city's history.\n\n\"We don't know what's going to happen,\" MacCallum told TheWrap Tuesday morning.\n\nTheWrap caught up with MacCallum as she prepared for her marathon day about the network's plans, how the elections could impact 2026, whether she'd be interested in joining Bari Weiss' CBS News and whether she'll interview Mamdani again whether he wins or loses. \"I have kept in touch with his campaign,\" she said.\n\nTheWrap: Do you have an Election Day routine? A favorite coffee, a snack vice or something you do every November?\n\nMacCallum: I always try to get up and go for a run, which I did this morning, which is just a good, energizing way to start the day. Today was a perfect day for it, because it's just a beautiful November election morning, and I just try to eat right and eat healthy so that I don't burn out on some sugary something early in the day. Just sort of try to stay steady and focused and be ready for the big night.\n\nWe're in an off-year election cycle, and I know that some of the other networks are coming on a little bit earlier with their election coverage. Why is Fox News starting its news coverage around 10 p.m.?\n\nI mean, we have obviously a very strong lineup all throughout the day. I'm doing \"Outnumbered\" today, I'm doing my show at 3, Bret's doing his show at six. So, we're doing what we always do. We're a team-based organization, so we'll be coming on and off, really, all day.\n\nWhat races are you paying the most attention to tonight?\n\nIt's kind of exciting for those of us who happen to live in New York and New Jersey. You know, often we're focused on races across the country, but these are hometown races for us in New York, so I find that particularly interesting. [Republican gubernatorial candidate] Jack Ciattarelli has run three times in New Jersey. Each time he's gotten closer. We've seen movement in New Jersey in a more red direction when you look across the counties in New Jersey. Whether or not that will lead to a win for him tonight is why we tune in to watch the game. We don't know what's going to happen. Obviously, the New York race has been fascinating to me. I interviewed Zohran Mamdani on my show and got to kind of see him up close a bit, and, obviously it's very historic if we end up having a socialist mayor of New York City. That's going to be a big story. So it looks very good for him. I think that's not going out on a limb to say at this point, I think if anything other than that happened, it would be a huge upset. If you took one of the polls right now, and despite the fact that we've seen a huge early vote turnout -- I always anticipated, actually, that we would just see a really big turnout for this election, because generally, the New York City Mayor's race is won or lost in in June in the primary, you know. It's not usually a race that we watch that closely in November. It's pretty much a done deal. But that's not the case at this time.\n\nAs you mentioned, you did Zohran's first and only Fox News interview this election cycle. Have there been any conversations about bringing him onto the network again if he wins or loses?\n\nAbsolutely. I have kept in touch with his campaign, and I do anticipate that he'll be joining us again, especially if he becomes the mayor of New York City. Yeah, we've talked about doing another interview.\n\nWhen do you expect to see results tonight? There's been talk, especially since 2020, about elections dragging on for days. Do you think we'll have new mayors, new governors, new attorney generals in Virginia by the time we all go to bed on the East Coast?\n\nYeah, that's the big question that we just don't know the answer to. Look at the polling -- we know the polls been very uneven in recent cycles. We have new Fox News polls that we're going to be watching tonight. It's the newest version of our voter analysis. So that's a pretty good benchmark, and we'll see how those are when they start coming in early in the evening, and we'll get a look. I don't know, you know? I mean, if the polls are right, then we certainly could see tight races in New Jersey and potentially in Virginia. It basically goes up to close. So you've got the close in Virginia at 7 p.m., the close in New Jersey at 8 p.m. and the close in Manhattan, in New York City, I should say at 9 p.m. I think we're going to have some answers tonight. I'd be surprised if it drags on. The one place that I think you could maybe see it go longer is potentially in New Jersey.\n\nWe're about to enter the longest government shutdown we've ever had this week. Are you seeing that having an impact on how people are voting?\n\nI think it could very likely have an impact in Virginia. I mean, you have all of those counties around Washington D.C., where most of the federal workers actually live, and many of them work there as well. So I do think that there's an opportunity for impact from the shutdown to be sure. There's some discussion that maybe Democrats wanted to keep the government shut down until after the election as a motivator for some of those individuals who are impacted. That might be a somewhat cynical view, but it's certainly out there. So I think, [in] Virginia, that could be a big part of the conversation when we're analyzing Virginia tonight.\n\nAnother race that has been garnering some national attention is the ballot initiative in California to reshape its congressional maps. Are you focused on that race and what is the impact of that ballot initiative?\n\nWe are absolutely. That's one of the four places that we're covering tonight, Virginia, New Jersey, New York, and that California Prop 50, which is a big issue we've heard a lot about with the redistricting effort in Texas. We know that Republicans are backing that strongly, and we see that Gavin Newsom, who's considered a top contender for 2028, is really pushing this Prop 50, which would allow a temporary redistricting move to basically counteract what is underway in Texas. So obviously all of this makes the midterm heat turned up, and as soon as tonight is over, the focus will be very strongly on those midterms. So we'll see if people in California support this ballot initiative tonight, and if it's going to sort of shake up the way things look in California. You got a lot of big names in California on both sides of that issue, a lot of people very invested, on the GOP side, in trying to make sure it doesn't happen. On the Democrat side, you've got Kamala Harris and Nancy Pelosi and all the big players on that side, [Arnold] Schwarzenegger and Kevin McCarthy on the other side.\n\nTaking together all of these races, what is the impact for the 2026 midterms?\n\nI think there'll be a lot of prognosticating about what the tea leaves look like after tonight for 2026, but I always feel like, although the election cycles go really quickly, it is rare that when the midterm comes around, we're really talking a lot about a special election or an off-cycle election that happened 18 months before. I think there's always new issues that are in front of people. At that point, we're going to see what's going on with the economy in 2026 about the shutdown as well. You know, in all of the times that I've spent on the ground talking to reporters and talking to voters over all these years, it's so rare that someone says, \"Well, I'm voting based on that shutdown that we had 18 months ago.\" It's just not something that sticks with people. Obviously, it has a short-term impact of the shutdown, but I don't think it has a lasting impact ultimately. You know, when you really look at this situation, I know I'm going down the shutdown road here for a second, but you have about 5,000 jobs that have been eliminated because of the shutdown. They have way more than that who are not currently working, but those people all get repaid. So unless you're directly impacted by that -- and that is a big deal, obviously, for those individuals, and certainly it's a broader deal for the people who are affected by airline travel -- but I think that when you get to 2026, the focus is going to be heavily on how the U.S. economy is doing. The president has made a lot of big bets when it comes to tariffs. I think the impact of tariffs has been much softer than people imagined that it would be. I think you're going to be hearing more layoffs that are potentially AI-related. So you know, when I start looking ahead towards 2026, I think I'm going to be a lot more focused on those issues than on shutdown or an election in Virginia or even New Jersey.\n\nWell, we're seeing a lot of people talk about the stakes in electing Mamdani or passing Prop 50 or electing Abigail Spanberger in Virginia, or if a Republican takes the governor's house in New Jersey, which hasn't happened in a good number of years. So do you see the effects of these elections having some impact on just how voters are living their lives now leading up to 2026?\n\nYou can't completely discount it, and you do look at movement, right? For example, in New Jersey, you've had a pretty steady movement in the red direction. That doesn't mean that those counties voted for Republicans. But you see that movement, especially in some of the like Cumberland, some of the far south districts in New Jersey, to Passaic County, which is a heavily Hispanic County in New Jersey, has become more progressively red, which are trends that we saw in the last presidential election as well. So those trends and how close it is in certain areas will certainly be something that we're going to analyze and look at that movement of where voters were going. Black voters, Hispanic voters, obviously made big moves in the 2024 presidential [election], and so I think that is very valuable in terms of looking at where the movement is right now.\n\nYou've seen some of the other networks join Fox in using AP data to help power its tabulation and help produce results. How has that partnership worked for Fox over the last few years, and do you think that'll make an impact on just how quickly you guys get votes?\n\nThe operation gets better and better with each election cycle. We have a lot of year-round work that goes into this analysis and to our decision desk work. So I just feel like technology allows us to get better and better at making these calls. I have a lot of confidence in it. You know, our record over all of these years is excellent in making these calls so and, as I said, with added technology and sharpening these partnerships, I think it just gets better.\n\nWhat does tomorrow morning look like for you? Do you think we'll be in a different political headspace or landscape?\n\nI think if we have a Democratic socialist in charge of New York City, I think that's something that's going to prompt quite a bit of conversation and thought about where the Democratic Party in particular is headed. Now, New York is obviously unique. It's much more liberal generally than other big cities across the country, but we are seeing a number of socialists on the ballot in the Midwest as well, in Minneapolis. So I think that that's a conversation that's really significant when you look at American politics in terms of where the Democratic Party is going. So I imagine we'll be very focused on that, especially if Mamdani wins in New York tomorrow.\n\nI know the president likes to make a habit of calling into shows. Do you see him potentially publicly speaking out on Fox about the election? I know he made a statement yesterday.\n\nIt's certainly possible! You know, he weighs in and speaks to the press on most days, several times a day, which is a stark difference from what we had in the prior president. So it wouldn't surprise me if he weighed in, but I can't really say at this point whether or not we'll be talking to him tonight.\n\nFair enough. Just on a broader note, we're seeing a lot of change in the media landscape generally, especially those leading news organizations. Do you have any interest or any consideration in joining Bari Weiss' CBS News?\n\nI'm in a long-term contract here at Fox, and very happy to be in that situation. We have a really amazing team. It's no surprise to me that people would be interested in our team, but we have something special here. It's no surprise to me that other places are trying to become more like Fox and to be a little bit more fair in their coverage and to recognize, you know, all parts of the country, and not just small sections of it, which I think has been a huge mistake for the legacy media organizations, and I think they're waking up to that and they're putting some new leadership in charge because of it. So I think that anything that makes news better across the board is a positive for the country.",

        "description": "Paul Gigot hosts a 'Journal Editorial Report' panel to discuss California's upcoming special election to vote on Gov. Gavin Newsom's Prop 50, which some criticize as gerrymandering, and the upcoming Pennsylvania Supreme court justice retention vote.\n\nIt's Election Day in California, where a ballot initiative will make a huge impact on next year's battle for the U.S. House majority whether it passes or fails.\n\nCalifornia voters are deciding whether to pass a ballot proposition which would dramatically alter the state's congressional districts, putting the left-leaning state front-and-center in the high-stakes political fight over redistricting that pits President Donald Trump and the GOP against the Democrats.\n\nCalifornia state lawmakers this summer approved a special proposition on the November ballot to obtain voter approval to temporarily sidetrack the state's nonpartisan redistricting commission and return the power to draw the congressional maps to the Democrat-dominated legislature. Early voting by mail in the contest has been underway for a month.\n\nThe effort in California, which could create five more Democratic-leaning congressional districts, aims to counter the passage in the reliable red state of Texas of a new map that aims to create up to five right-leaning House seats. Failure to approve what's known as Proposition 50 would be a stinging setback for Democrats.\n\nOBAMA ENDORSES NEWSOM CALIFORNIA REDISTRICTING PROP 50\n\nTwo-term Gov. Gavin Newsom, who is seen as a likely 2028 Democratic presidential contender, is spearheading the push to pass the proposition.\n\n\"If we lose here, we are going to have total Republican control in the House, the Senate and the White House for at least two more years,\" Newsom emphasized in a recent fundraising appeal to supporters. \"If we win here, we can put a check on Trump for his final two years.\"\n\nHEAD HERE FOR THE LATEST FOX NEWS REPORTING, ANALYSIS, ON 2025 ELECTIONS\n\nThe push by Trump and Republicans for a rare mid-decade redistricting is part of a broad effort by the GOP to pad its razor-thin House majority to keep control of the chamber in the 2026 midterms, when the party in power traditionally faces political headwinds and loses seats.\n\nTrump and his political team are aiming to prevent what happened during his first term in the White House, when Democrats reclaimed the House majority in the 2018 midterm elections.\n\nMissouri last month joined Texas as the second GOP-controlled state to pass congressional redistricting ahead of next year's elections. The new map in Missouri is likely to give the GOP another right-leaning seat.\n\nAnd North Carolina's Republican-controlled legislature also passed a new map, which is likely to score another congressional seat for the GOP. Republican-controlled Indiana is on deck, with a special legislative session getting underway this week.\n\nBut unlike those states, California voters need to weigh in before giving redistricting power back to the legislature in Sacramento.\n\n\"Heaven help us if we lose,\" Newsom said in a fundraising pitch. \"This is an all-hands-on-deck moment for Democrats.\"\n\nFIVE KEY 2025 RACES TO WATCH\n\nProponents and opponents of Proposition 50 raised hundreds of millions of dollars in fundraising, with much of the money being dished out to pay for a deluge of ads on both sides.\n\nOne of the two main groups countering Newsom and the Democrats labeled their effort \"Stop Sacramento's Power Grab.\"\n\nGetting into the fight was former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, who was the last Republican governor of California.\n\nDuring his tenure as governor, Schwarzenegger had a starring role in the passage of constitutional amendments in California in 2008 and 2010 that took the power to draw state legislative and congressional districts away from politicians and placed it in the hands of an independent commission.\n\nNORTHERN CALIFORNIA VOTERS WEIGH IN ON PROP 50 REDISTRICTING FIGHT\n\n\"That's what they want to do is take us backwards -- this is why it is important for you to vote no on Prop 50,\" Schwarzenegger said in an ad against Proposition 50. \"Democracy -- we've got to protect it, and we've got to go and fight for it.\"\n\nBut as Election Day neared in California, the Yes forces had dramatically outraised the No forces, and public opinion polling indicated majority support for the proposition.\n\nEven before Trump initiated his redistricting push, Ohio was under court order to redraw its maps. That could boost Republicans in a one-time battleground state that now leans right.\n\nRepublicans in GOP-dominated Florida are also mulling congressional redistricting. And Democrats in heavily blue Maryland are weighing a redistricting push, while the Democrat-controlled legislature in Virginia is already pushing redistricting.\n\nCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nOther states considering altering their maps are Democrat-dominated Illinois and red states Kansas and Nebraska.\n\nMeanwhile, Democrats could possibly pick up a seat in Republican-dominated Utah, due to a new, more competitive map, mandated by a judge.",

Gavin Newsom, the ballot initiative intends to offset the effects of President Donald Trump's efforts in Texas to add five Republican-held seats to Congress as Republicans seek to maintain their control of the U.S. House ahead of the 2026 midterm election.\n\nCalifornia and Texas are just two states that have been at the center of the contentious battle for control of the House in 2026, as more states across the country take a closer look at redrawing their congressional districts mid-decade to bolster their party's power in Washington. As a result, redistricting efforts like the one in California have drawn national attention, garnering input from figures such as former President Barack Obama, who is for Proposition 50, and former California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, who is against the measure.\n\nTens of millions of dollars have been poured into the contest from both sides of the aisle, as Newsom aims to frame the battle as a fight to save democracy from Trump and Republicans aim to depict it as a power grab from Democrats.",

        "title": "5 Things We're Watching on Election Day in California",
        "description": "Proposition 50 is the only statewide question on the ballot, but there are numerous dynamics at play.\n\nIt's Election Day in California. There's only one statewide question on the ballot, but there are numerous dynamics at play, political and otherwise. Here are five things we're watching.\n\nDoes Proposition 50 pass or fail?\n\nThe measure on the ballot is called Proposition 50, and the main issue at stake is whether Democrats can wrest up to five California congressional seats -- and potentially, control of the House of Representatives -- from Republicans.\n\nOrdinarily, the state's political maps are determined and drawn by a nonpartisan commission. But Gov. Gavin Newsom persuaded the Democrats who control the State Legislature to approve a ballot measure that would let state lawmakers redraw California's congressional districts to increase the chances that Democrats will win more of the seats.\n\nThe proposed shift was a response to President Trump's push to get Republicans in Texas and other states to redraw their maps to help his party keep control of the House. The measure in California could net as many as five congressional seats for Democrats.\n\nThe latest polling shows that Proposition 50 is likely to pass.\n\n* Here's what to know about voting in today's election.\n\nDoes the Justice Department's election monitoring go smoothly?\n\nThe Justice Department plans to monitor polling sites in five counties in California, a move that will likely heighten tensions on Election Day and in the days afterward during the vote-counting process.\n\nPersonnel from the agency's Civil Rights Division will be stationed at polling places and offices of registrars of voters \"to ensure transparency, ballot security, and compliance with federal law,\" the Justice Department said in a statement.\n\nElection monitors will be stationed in Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, Fresno and Kern Counties. Election monitors will also be present in New Jersey. The move by the Justice Department was prompted by complaints from Republican Party officials in the two states, which are led by Democrats.\n\nElection monitoring by the Justice Department is not uncommon when Americans go to the polls. But Democrats in California said the decision to put election monitors in counties with large percentages of Latino voters was a politically motivated effort aimed at suppressing the vote. The California attorney general, Rob Bonta, said the state would deploy its own observers, to monitor the monitors.\n\nShirley Weber, California's secretary of state, said her office \"will not permit tactics masquerading as oversight to erode voter confidence or intimidate Californians.\"\n\nRead more about the Justice Department's plans for election monitoring.\n\nHow do the results help or hurt Gavin Newsom?\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom's political fortunes are closely tied with the results of today's election.\n\nIf Proposition 50 wins, Newsom will be praised by Democrats on the national stage for pulling off a major victory against President Trump. If it fails, Newsom will have gambled and lost, having putting his political clout and brand as a Trump fighter on the line.\n\nNewsom said recently on \"CBS News Sunday Morning,\" that he will consider running for president after the 2026 midterm elections. If the ballot measure he has pushed for wins, it will give him a fresh foundation to build a presidential campaign on.\n\nHere's how Newsom turned this special election into a national platform for a possible 2028 presidential run.\n\nDo the ICE raids affect Latino turnout?\n\nThis Election Day is unusual in at least one significant way: It will take place while the Trump administration conducts an immigration crackdown that has upended life for many Latinos in parts of California.\n\nThe ICE raids have spread widespread fear in Latino communities. Some undocumented immigrants have effectively become shut-ins, avoiding going to work, church or to stores because they are afraid federal agents will detain and eventually deport them. Some Latinos who are United States citizens said they have started carrying their passports with them when they leave home in case they get pulled over.\n\nDemocratic officials and Latino voting-rights activists worry that the fear of ICE raids will dampen Latino turnout. Voter data of the turnout so far in California shows that Latino participation is roughly on pace with past elections.\n\nThere are signs that the administration's crackdown may be encouraging more Latino participation. Interviews with two dozen elected officials, voting experts and voters in California showed that the ICE raids were motivating many Latinos to cast ballots against Republicans and President Trump.\n\nRead more about how immigration raids are affecting Latino voters.\n\nIt's decision time for many after Tuesday. Who's in and who's out?\n\nWe're expecting a series of big decisions from several political figures in the state at some point after Election Day.\n\nSenator Alex Padilla, whose forcible removal from a Trump administration news conference in June resonated as a call to action for many Democrats, is considering joining the 2026 governor's race. He recently told The New York Times that he was weighing jumping in.\n\n\"But my focus is first and foremost on encouraging people to vote for Proposition 50,\" he told The Times's Lulu Garcia-Navarro.\n\nRick Caruso, a billionaire developer who spent more than $100 million in 2022 on an unsuccessful run for mayor of Los Angeles, has indicated he's considering running for mayor again or running for governor.\n\nOne of the state's top Democrats, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, is also weighing a decision on whether to seek re-election. Pelosi, 85, has not yet said whether she will seek another term in 2026 in the San Francisco seat she has occupied in Congress since 1987. She stepped down as the Democratic leader after the 2022 midterm elections.\n\nScott Wiener, a Democratic state legislator, announced he was tired of waiting for her decision and is running for her seat.\n\n* Here's what Wiener told our reporter about his decision to run.",

        "description": "'Fox News Live' panelists Howard Kurtz, Kevin Madden and Ron Bonjean break down the upcoming elections in New York, New Jersey and Virginia.\n\nVoters in California and New York City will be voting on key ballot measures on Tuesday, with some of them drawing national attention for their significance.\n\nBoth measures could have ripple effects far beyond their borders -- influencing control of Congress and reshaping how America's biggest city conducts elections. Together, the proposals offer voters in the nation's two largest blue strongholds a chance to reshape how political power and housing policy are decided.\n\nRead on to learn more about each of the top measures.\n\nThe most notable ballot measure being voted on is Proposition 50 in California, where residents are deciding whether to pass a ballot proposition which would dramatically alter the state's congressional districts. The measure puts the left-leaning state front and center in the high-stakes political fight over redistricting.\n\nCalifornia state lawmakers this summer approved a special proposition on the November ballot to obtain voter approval to temporarily sidetrack the state's nonpartisan redistricting commission and return the power to draw the congressional maps to the Democrat-dominated legislature.\n\nGOP HOPEFUL WARNS SOCIALIST MAYORAL CANDIDATE IN MINNEAPOLIS IS A 'COPY-PASTE' OF MAMDANI\n\nThe effort, which could create five more Democratic-leaning congressional districts, aims to counter the passage in the red-state of Texas of a new map that aims to create up to five right-leaning House seats. Failure to approve the measure would be a stinging setback for Democrats.\n\nProponents and opponents of Proposition 50 reported raising more than $215 million as of Oct. 2, with much of the money being dished out to pay for a deluge of ads on both sides.\n\nOne of the two main groups countering Gov. Gavin Newsom and the Democrats is labeling its effort \"Stop Sacramento's Power Grab.\"\n\nAlso getting into the fight is former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, the last Republican governor of California.\n\nEVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT ELECTION DAY 2025: CRITICAL ELECTIONS, BALLOT MEASURES AND MORE\n\n\"That's what they want to do is take us backwards. This is why it is important for you to vote no on Prop 50,\" Schwarzenegger says in an ad against Proposition 50. \"Democracy -- we've got to protect it, and we've got to go and fight for it.\"\n\nWhen voters head to the polls, a \"Yes\" vote will approve the Newsom backed plan to re-draw the maps starting in 2026 and a \"No\" vote would keep the existing maps.\n\nIn addition to deciding who will be the city's next mayor, 5.1 million registered New York City voters will also decide on a measure, known as Question 6, that would move election dates for city offices to the same year as federal presidential elections.\n\nAccording to the city's official election website, \"'Yes' moves City elections to the same year as Federal Presidential Elections, when permitted by state law. 'No' leaves laws unchanged.\"\n\nAdvocates of moving the election to coincide with federal elections argue it will increase turnout and thus provide results more representative of the electorate as a whole.\n\nOpponents argue that key local issues will get buried in national politics if the elections are moved.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAffordable housing is perhaps the most talked about campaign issue in New York City and voters will be asked two questions related to that issue when they walk into polling places on Tuesday.\n\nProposal 2 is framed as a way to \"fast track\" affordable housing in the city.\n\n\"This proposal would make two new processes to fast-track certain affordable housing projects,\" New York City's election website says. \"The first process is for publicly financed affordable housing projects. The second process is for affordable housing projects in the 12 community districts with the lowest rates of affordable housing development.\"\n\nProposal 4 in New York City is described by the collection committee as a vote to, \"Establish an Affordable Housing Appeals Board with Council, Borough, and Citywide Representation.\"\n\n\"This proposal would change the current land use review process when the City Council rejects or changes an affordable housing project,\" the measure is framed.\n\n\"The proposal would create an Affordable Housing Appeals Board, made up of the local Borough President, Speaker of the City Council, and Mayor. The proposal would allow the Appeals Board to reverse the City Council's decision with a two-to-one vote.\"\n\nHousing is also the focus of Proposal 3, \"where a Yes\" vote \"simplifies review for limited land-use changes, including modest housing and minor infrastructure projects\" and a \"no\" vote is described as a vote that \"leaves these changes subject to longer review, with final decision by City Council.\"",

        "title": "Trump is on the ballot in these seven races",
        "description": "Key elections Tuesday in New York, Virginia, New Jersey and California\n\nPresident Donald Trump may not be on the ballot Tuesday, but in many places, he might as well be.\n\nThe president's influence can be felt in several key races across the country, from candidates both parties have nominated to a referendum in California that seeks to counter Trump's efforts to gerrymander a Republican majority in the House of Representatives.\n\nThe results will be the first major sign of how voters are responding to the president's norm-shattering second term ahead of next year's midterms.\n\nHere's a quick look at the races to watch:\n\nWho's running: Democrat Abigail Spanberger, a centrist former House member from Virginia's 7th Congressional District, is facing off against Republican Winsome Earle-Sears, the state's very Trumpy lieutenant governor and the first Black woman elected to statewide office in Virginia.\n\nWhat it means for Trump: Virginia's one-term limit and the state's proximity to Washington, D.C., make the governor's race closely watched. It's widely seen as an indicator of voters' thoughts on the president.\n\nWhat might happen: Spanberger is heavily favored to win in a race that centrist Democratic strategists will be sure to highlight as they pitch a path forward.\n\nWho's running: Democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani is facing former Gov. Andrew Cuomo (running as an independent) and Republican Curtis Sliwa. Incumbent Mayor Eric Adams dropped out of the race and endorsed Cuomo.\n\nWhat it means for Trump: The president has repeatedly criticized Mamdani and threatened to withhold federal funding and send the National Guard to New York City if he wins.\n\nWhat might happen: Mamdani is favored to win in a race that will be cited by progressive strategists as a sign that Democrats need to take bolder stances.\n\nWho's running: Democrat Mikie Sherrill, another centrist and a member of Congress, is facing off against Trump-endorsed Jack Ciattarelli, a former state lawmaker.\n\nWhat it means for Trump: Ciattarelli narrowly lost four years ago, when he ran without Trump's backing. He has the president's endorsement now, so this will be seen as a key test of whether that helps or hurts.\n\nWhat might happen: Polls show either a narrow Sherrill lead or a toss-up. Whatever happens will end up as fodder for either centrists or progressives arguing about the results in Virginia and New York City.\n\nWhat's on the ballot: A ballot measure backed by Gov. Gavin Newsom would adopt a Democratic redistricting plan in order to counter Texas' Republican gerrymander.\n\nWhat it means for Trump: The measure would help keep Democrats competitive in the House in next year's midterms, which could put a legislative check on Trump.\n\nWhat might happen: Polls show the measure is likely to pass, giving a boost to Newsom, who has become a thorn in Trump's side in recent months.\n\nWhat's on the ballot: A conservative-backed ballot measure would add new restrictions on voting by mail and require photo ID before casting a ballot, among other changes.\n\nWhat it means for Trump: The measure reads like a wish list for the kinds of voting restrictions that he has called for since losing the 2020 election.\n\nWhat might happen: Polls show a toss-up. A win would likely embolden Republicans to put more voting restrictions on the ballot in other states.\n\nWhat's on the ballot: Three Democratic justices on the state Supreme Court face an up-or-down retention vote. Republicans have mounted an unusually aggressive campaign against them.\n\nWhat it means for Trump: If all three justices lose, Republicans would have a shot at winning a majority in 2027, in time to make crucial decisions about the 2028 presidential election.\n\nWhat might happen: Polls show a toss-up, with many voters still undecided. Judges typically win retention races, but they also rarely face much of a campaign against them.\n\nWhat's on the ballot: Democratic Mayor Aftab Pureval is facing a challenge from Republican Cory Bowman in the race, which is technically for a nonpartisan post.\n\nWhat it means for Trump: Bowman is Vice President JD Vance's half-brother and says he was inspired to run when he was attending the inauguration.\n\nWhat might happen: Pureval will easily be reelected in a city where Kamala Harris won more than three-fourths of the vote in 2024. But expect Trump to make some kind of complaint about the results.",

        "title": "The Gamble Behind a Takeover of Kenvue, Maker of Tylenol",
        "description": "Kimberly-Clark's $40 billion deal for Kenvue, the embattled maker of Tylenol and other consumer products, seemingly flies in the face of two M.&A. maxims: skirt uncertainty whenever possible, and avoid inviting scrutiny by the Trump administration.\n\nLauren Hirsch breaks down why the consumer goods giants made their bet -- and whether they can get out of it.\n\nTalks began after Kenvue announced a strategic review in July, effectively putting itself up for sale. The company was already under pressure from shareholders, including the activist investor Starboard Value, whose co-founder, Jeff Smith, joined its board in March.\n\nIn September, the Trump administration linked the use of Tylenol during pregnancy to autism, a connection that the company has strongly denied. That turmoil hovered over deal talks and helped Kimberly-Clark push for an agreement that valued Kenvue at a discount to its peers. (The transaction values Kenvue at $21.01 a share, only slightly above where the company was trading before word of the administration's plans emerged.)\n\nOne big question: Did the companies give federal officials a heads-up about the deal? That tactic, which has grown popular during the second Trump administration, may have bolstered executives' confidence.\n\nThe Kenvue deal is a bet that the markets have overreacted. Kimberly-Clark has long been interested in acquiring Kenvue, given its well-known brands and overlap in customers, people with knowledge of the deal told DealBook. Company executives told analysts on Monday that they worked with legal, health and government experts to do thorough due diligence.\n\nThey seemingly concluded that the cost and uncertainty of buying Kenvue were outweighed by the quality of the target company's brands -- and the price they would pay. (Among the winners of the deal were the many activist investors in Kenvue's stock.)\n\nMany shareholders in Kimberly-Clark seem to think that the company didn't get enough of a discount: Its shares fell down nearly 15 percent on Monday.\n\nKimberly-Clark probably can't cite litigation risk as an escape hatch. Regulatory filings by the company published on Monday showed that business pressures related to acetaminophen or talc, whose legal liability Kenvue has assumed from Johnson & Johnson, don't appear to qualify as acceptable reasons to walk away.\n\nHowever, there is a caveat to that carve-out in a disclosure letter by Kenvue that hasn't been publicly filed yet.\n\nThere could be other ways to kill the deal. Both Kenvue and Kimberly-Clark stockholders must vote on the transaction. But with a final deadline for closing set for the second half of 2026, shareholders most likely won't vote for months, according to Eric Talley, a professor at Columbia Law School.\n\n\"If Kenvue gets clobbered by Tylenol liability in the meantime, Kimberly-Clark stockholders are unlikely to approve the deal,\" Talley told DealBook. \"If Kenvue runs the table and escapes all liability risk, its own stockholders may bridle and vote the deal down.\"\n\nHERE'S WHAT'S HAPPENING\n\nDick Cheney has died. Cheney, who served as vice president under George W. Bush from 2001 to 2009, died on Monday at 84. A prominent conservative who embraced low taxes and pushed for a strong military response to the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, he later broke ranks with the Republican Party when he endorsed Kamala Harris over Donald Trump in the 2024 election.\n\nThe Trump administration reportedly blocks Nvidia's A.I. chip exports to China. Senior officials including Secretary of State Marco Rubio pushed President Trump not to discuss with President Xi Jinping of China a request by the chipmaker to sell its most advanced chips to Beijing, according to The Wall Street Journal. But Nvidia's stock rose 2.2 percent on Monday after Microsoft said that it had received an export license to ship the company's most advanced chips to the United Arab Emirates.\n\nOpenAI strikes a huge deal with Amazon. The ChatGPT maker agreed to buy $38 billion worth of cloud computing capacity from the tech giant over seven years, days after it renegotiated its relationship with Microsoft partly to reach such agreements. And Alphabet issued $25 billion in corporate bonds as it spends heavily on A.I.\n\nHawkish Fed comments spook investors. Stocks fell in Asia and Europe, as did U.S. equity futures, after two Fed policymakers cast some doubt about whether the central bank would cut rates again next month. Austan Goolsbee, the president of the Chicago Fed, said that persistent inflation meant that he was \"not decided\" about making another cut, while Lisa Cook, a Fed governor, said inflation and a slowing labor market meant that the central bank's decision was still \"live.\"\n\nNorway's sovereign wealth fund votes against Elon Musk's $1 trillion pay plan. Norges Bank Investment Management, the first major investor in Tesla to disclose how it voted, said that it was worried about the size, dilution and \"lack of mitigation of key person risk\" posed by the compensation package, which could be worth roughly $1 trillion if certain milestones are met. The carmaker is expected to announce the vote tally on Thursday.\n\nElection Day: What's at stake\n\nVoters head to the polls on Tuesday in New York and elsewhere in the country in a series of richly funded local races.\n\nPresident Trump has been a force, too. He fired off a volley of social media posts on Monday seeking to frame the races around the economy, immigration and crime, issues that helped him win the White House a year ago. He also endorsed Andrew Cuomo for New York mayor.\n\nThe outcomes could offer a litmus test on how Americans feel about Trump's continuing trade war and a federal government shutdown that seemingly has no end in sight.\n\nHere's what (and whom) to watch:\n\nIn New York City: Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee and front-runner, holds a wide margin in the polls over Cuomo, the former governor, and Curtis Sliwa, the Republican candidate. If Mamdani can score a decisive victory, could that augur a nationwide shift for the party toward tax-the-rich policy ideas that have spooked the city's business community and wealthy? And would Trump make good on his statement to cut the city off from federal funds if Mamdani wins?\n\nHere's who else has endorsed Mamdani and Cuomo.\n\nNew Jersey and Virginia are the sites of hotly contested governor races that have attracted big money from across the country. The New Jersey contest, pitting Representative Mikie Sherrill, a Democrat, against Jack Ciattarelli, a Republican, is expected to be the state's most expensive.\n\nPolitical analysts say a Democratic sweep -- and an especially strong showing by the party in the suburbs of Northern Virginia -- would serve as a rebuke to Trump and a sign of how voters in battleground states are leaning before midterm elections next year.\n\nThere's a lot on the line for California governor, Gavin Newsom. Proposition 50, Newsom's divisive gamble to redraw the state's voting district maps, has national implications (for him and his party). And it has attracted more than $120 million in donations, including from the billionaires George Soros, Michael Moritz and Reed Hastings. The haul shows Newsom's fund-raising prowess as he weighs a potential presidential bid in 2028.\n\nThat said, big-name donors to Newsom's previous campaigns, including Jeffrey Katzenberg and George Marcus, appear to be sitting this one out, according to Politico.\n\nCharles Munger Jr., the son of Charlie Munger, the longtime business partner of Warren Buffett, has emerged as the biggest backer of efforts to defeat Proposition 50. But, as a whole, the opposition has been vastly outgunned in donations.\n\n\"It's likely there'll be a 10 to 20 percent drawdown in equity markets sometime in the next 12 to 24 months.\"\n\n-- David Solomon of Goldman Sachs, predicting a market swoon at an investment summit in Hong Kong. Solomon is not alone; Jay Powell, the Fed chair, recently warned of \"fairly highly valued\" stock prices.\n\nA last gasp for the I.P.O. market?\n\nAfter a strong summer and early autumn, the I.P.O. market hit a snag when the government shut down, sidelining the S.E.C.\n\nSix initial public offerings raised $100 million or more in October, down from eight in the same month last year, according to data from the research and investment firm Renaissance Capital.\n\nThe S.E.C. offered companies a workaround, though, updating its guidance to allow new listing registration statements to become automatically effective 20 days after they were filed. Navan, a travel expense company, became the first to take advantage of the agency's new guidance last week.\n\nThe rule change laid the groundwork for a flurry of I.P.O. activity, with five I.P.O.s this week aiming to raise $100 million or more. Beta Technologies, an electric aerospace company, is the largest among them: It priced its initial public offering on Monday at $34 a share, above its expected range of $27 to $33.\n\nThat momentum is expected to slow. The S.E.C.'s workaround is best for companies already engaged with the agency. Both Navan and Beta had received comments from the S.E.C. on their filings before the shutdown, mitigating the risk of after-the-fact S.E.C. review.\n\n\"Soon the pipeline will run out of those names,\" Matthew Kennedy, a strategist at Renaissance Capital, told DealBook. \"A slowdown is inevitable.\"\n\nThere are other risks, too.

        "title": "Trump's strength, Democrats' message and the shutdown effect. What to watch on Election Day 2025",
        "description": "WASHINGTON -- Tuesday marks the nation's first major Election Day since President Donald Trump returned to the White House, and his leadership and policies dominated the debate in almost every race -- even though the Republican was absent from the campaign trail.\n\nThe biggest contests are in Virginia and New Jersey, the only states electing governors this year. Trump lost both last fall, but voters in each have a history of electing Republicans for statewide office. The GOP candidates have closely aligned themselves with the president, betting that his big win last year can still provide a path to victory this time, even if the party occupying the White House typically suffers in off-year elections.\n\nStrong Democratic showings, meanwhile, could provide the party a pathway back to national relevance -- even if its top candidates have taken very different approaches, from adhering to a moderate line to wholeheartedly embracing government spending to improve voters' lives.\n\nIn New York City, a self-described democratic socialist who already has been a target of Trump's criticism could emerge as a national star if elected mayor. And California voters will decide whether to redraw the state's House map, as Democrats look to counter a push by Trump to reshape the balance of congressional power.\n\nHere's what to watch:\n\nThe president did not set foot in either Virginia or New Jersey to campaign with Republican gubernatorial candidates Winsome Earle-Sears or Jack Ciattarelli, but both contests will likely be viewed as a referendum on Trump's job so far.\n\nOver the last year, his tariffs rocked the global economy, his \"big, beautiful\" budget bill threatened rural hospitals and health insurance coverage for millions, he enacted massive cuts to the federal workforce and he sent the National Guard to multiple American cities.\n\nThe president endorsed Ciattarelli in New Jersey's governor's race, but held only a pair of tele-town halls on his behalf, including one Monday night. Trump also did an Election Night eve tele-town hall for Virginia Republican candidates, but he did not mention Earle-Sears, speaking mostly in favor of the GOP candidate for attorney general. Earlier in the campaign, Trump gave Earle-Sears only a half-hearted endorsement, saying he supported the GOP candidate for governor though he did not use her name. Earle-Sears was nonetheless a fierce defender of Trump and his policies, just as Ciattarelli was in New Jersey.\n\nDespite Trump's distance, a good night for Republicans would almost certainly be viewed as a political victory for Trump and his \"Make America Great Again\" policies. A bad night for the GOP would give Democrats a strong -- though perhaps fleeting -- start heading into midterms that are still a year away.\n\nTuesday offers a test of two very different Democratic philosophies on display from candidates: toeing a moderate line or fully embracing far-left progressivism. But it also presents a scenario where both, or neither, could be successful -- making drawing conclusions going forward more difficult.\n\nThe party's candidates for governor, New Jersey Rep. Mikie Sherrill and former Rep. Abigail Spanberger of Virginia, have focused largely on the economy, public safety and health care, distancing themselves from some of the Democratic Party's far-left policies.\n\nA growing collection of Democratic leaders believe the moderate approach holds the key to the party's revival after the GOP won the White House and both congressional chambers last year. Tuesday could be a key indicator of whether they're right.\n\nBoth Sherrill and Spanberger have downplayed their support for progressive priorities, including LGBTQ rights and resistance against Trump's attack on American institutions. Spanberger rarely even mentions Trump's name on the campaign trail.\n\nBoth also have resumes that might appeal to the middle.\n\nSherrill spent a decade as an active-duty helicopter pilot for the Navy before entering Congress, while Spanberger is a former CIA case officer who spent years abroad working undercover. They have played up their public safety backgrounds as a direct response to the GOP's attack that Democrats are soft on crime.\n\nAbove all, the Democrats have focused on rising costs such as groceries, energy and health care, which Trump has struggled to control.\n\nThat approach is far different from New York City's mayoral race, where progressives are energized by Zohran Mamdani, a 34-year-old Muslim state legislator who identifies as a democratic socialist and backs radical changes to address economic inequality.\n\nHis bold agenda and inspirational approach have attracted thousands of volunteers in New York and brought the likes of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to campaign on his behalf. It has also spooked some business leaders and voices in the Jewish community, who otherwise support Democrats but oppose some of Mamdani's past statements about personal wealth accumulation and Israel.\n\nMamdani has been locked in a caustic race against former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who is running as an independent after losing the Democratic primary to Mamdani. Republican Curtis Sliwa is looking for a huge upset.\n\nAnd while many progressives are thrilled, some Republicans in Washington are also quietly rooting for a Mamdani victory. Republican campaign committees have already launched attack ads against more than a dozen vulnerable House Democrats in New York and New Jersey linking them to Mamdani and his far-left politics.\n\nTrump endorsed Cuomo, posting online Monday evening: \"Whether you personally like Andrew Cuomo or not, you really have no choice. You must vote for him, and hope he does a fantastic job. He is capable of it, Mamdani is not!\"\n\nThat's after Trump derided Mamdani nearly every day. GOP operatives are also giddy about the opportunity to use him to attack many more Democrats closer to next year's midterm elections -- just as they have done with progressive Democrats such as House \"squad\" members like Ocasio-Cortez and Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar.\n\nElection Day comes in the midst of a federal government shutdown that has already spanned more than a month. Both parties in Congress blame each other, and there is no end in sight.\n\nWill it matter?\n\nVirginia is home to more than 134,000 federal workers, many of whom have been furloughed or are being forced to work without pay. New Jersey has nearly 21,000 federal employees, according to the nonprofit Partnership for Public Service, out of a total of more than 2 million such government employees nationwide.\n\nEither number is more than enough to swing a close election.\n\nAt the same time, millions of people may be losing critical food assistance from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, offering voters another urgent reason to express their displeasure.\n\nPolling shows that Republicans, who control Congress and the White House, are getting slightly more blame than Democrats -- though there is plenty of frustration aimed at both sides.\n\nTrump has taken the extraordinary step of calling on the Senate to scrap filibuster rules requiring a 60-vote minimum on major legislation to try and force the government to reopen -- even though his party's leadership considers that a nonstarter.\n\nWhile Trump lost Virginia and New Jersey last fall, there were significant shifts to the right in both states. In New Jersey, Trump's 16-point loss in 2020 shrunk to less than 6 points in 2024.\n\nThose shifts were fueled by Trump's increasing popularity among traditional Democratic loyalists: labor union members, Black men, Hispanic voters and younger people. Democrats are particularly vulnerable in New Jersey, which has among the largest percentage of labor union households in the nation.\n\nIf those pro-Trump trends continue this week, Democrats could be in trouble.\n\nBut Trump is not on the ballot, of course. And the Trump coalition -- especially lower-propensity voters -- has not typically shown up in the same numbers in non-presidential years.\n\nDemocrats are cautiously optimistic given that Trump did not campaign aggressively in either state, a move driven both by the president's weak standing and his allies' concerns about the Republican candidates' viability -- especially in Virginia.\n\nAt the same time, the biggest star in Democratic politics, former President Barack Obama, rallied voters in New Jersey and Virginia over the weekend.\n\nPennsylvania voters will decide whether three state Supreme Court justices supported by Democrats will serve another term.\n\nThe outcome may shape the seven-member high court in the nation's most populous swing state, and may have implications for key cases involving redistricting and balloting for midterm elections and the 2028 presidential race.\n\nThe incumbents aren't listed by party affiliation. The ballot merely asks voters to cast a yes-or-no vote. But spending on the race is likely to exceed $15 million, indicating how important it is to Democrats and Republicans in Pennsylvania and beyond.\n\nIn California, Gov. Gavin Newsom, frequently mentioned as a 2028 presidential hopeful, is leading a charge to redraw congressional maps to give Democrats as many as five more House seats in upcoming elections.\n\nThe push is the centerpiece of a Democratic effort to counter new Republican maps in Texas and elsewhere that were drawn to boost the GOP's chances in next year's fight to control Congress. In order for the new maps to count in 2026, however, voters will first have to approve a yes-or-no ballot question known as Proposition 50.",

        "title": "Analysis | What's on the ballot today?",
        "description": "In today's edition ... New Jersey and Virginia have major governors' races ... New York City decides its next mayor ... Democrats' biggest redistricting push hits the ballot ...\n\nIt's Election Day.\n\nMany of you will go to the polls today to vote in key races across the country. From bellwether governors' races to a redistricting proposal that could alter the congressional playing field, this year's races will have an outsize impact on next year's midterms. Here are the races to watch:\n\nCalifornia\n\nPolls close at 11 p.m. Eastern time.\n\nThe key race: A ballot question -- Proposition 50 -- on whether the state should change its congressional map.\n\nWhy it matters: Democrats, led by Gov. Gavin Newsom, are asking California voters to make the state's congressional map more favorable for their party. The proposition comes in response to Republican-led states, including Texas and Missouri, redrawing their maps to favor the GOP in response to pressure from President Donald Trump.\n\nIf approved, the new congressional maps could give Democrats five additional congressional seats in California, likely limiting Republican representation to the state's eastern interior. The race has become a referendum on Trump in a state Republicans lost by over 3 million votes last year; Democrats are increasingly optimistic the question will pass.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nPolls close at 8 p.m. Eastern time.\n\nThe key race: For governor, Republican Jack Ciattarelli versus Democrat Mikie Sherrill. Unlike in many other states, the lieutenant governor is elected on a joint ticket with the governor, and the governor appoints the attorney general.\n\nWhy it matters: New Jersey has gone blue in every presidential election since 1988, but Republicans are still optimistic. No party has held the governor's mansion for three terms in a row since 1961, and the current Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy has been blamed for New Jersey's staggering cost of living, an issue that's become a centerpiece for the race. Sherrill, a Navy pilot-turned-congresswoman, has distanced herself from Murphy.\n\nTrump performed better last year than any other Republican presidential candidate has in the state in decades, losing by only six percentage points. But Trump also influenced the race negatively: By withholding funding for the Gateway tunnel project connecting New Jersey to New York, the most economically significant infrastructure project in the state.\n\nCiattarelli, a state assemblyman, defended the move as a negotiating tactic but has acknowledged the project's importance to New Jersey. Sherrill won her seat in Congress in 2018 on an anti-Trump message. The results tonight could shed light on how salient that message is today.\n\nNew York City\n\nPolls close at 9 p.m. Eastern time.\n\nThe key races: For mayor, Democrat Zohran Mamdani, Republican Curtis Sliwa and Democrat-turned-third-party-candidate Andrew M. Cuomo. A number of ballot proposals will also be up, including one to move New York City elections to presidential years.\n\nWhy it matters: The New York City mayoral race has created an identity crisis within the Democratic Party nationally. Mamdani won his party's nomination with a democratic socialist message, vowing to expand housing, food access and health care in the city with one of the highest costs of living in the world. He would be the city's first Muslim mayor, and his past statements on Israel have drawn considerable controversy in the city with the largest Jewish community outside of Israel. Republicans have been quick to link Democrats around the country to Mamdani, and his democratic socialist positions have worried moderate Democrats who fear they could turn off independents.\n\nBut Mamdani has also energized the left in a way that could be a model for future Democratic campaigns. He has garnered the endorsement of mainstream Democrats including Gov. Kathy Hochul and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, who assert that the party is a big tent capable of holding politicians with various approaches.\n\nCuomo left the governorship in 2021 with a trail of controversies, from allegations of sexual harassment to his handling of the covid-19 pandemic. Still he has the backing of a coalition of moderate, pro-Israel and conservative voters. Trump reluctantly backed Cuomo in a \"60 Minutes\" interview that aired Sunday. Sliwa, who founded the Guardian Angels group that combated crime during the city's crime epidemic of the 1980s, rejected calls from Republicans to drop out to give Cuomo a better shot.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPolls close at 8 p.m. Eastern time.\n\nThe key race: Three Democratic Supreme Court justices in Pennsylvania -- Christine Donohue, Kevin Dougherty and David Wecht -- will ask voters for another 10 years on the commonwealth's highest court.\n\nWhy it matters: It isn't often that state judicial races get national attention, but in a political bellwether state like Pennsylvania, these contests have undeniable national implications, from abortion rights to redistricting to election law during the 2028 presidential campaign.\n\nThese Supreme Court elections are known as retention elections; the candidates aren't running against anyone, but rather are asking voters to allow them to keep their jobs. Democrats currently hold a 5-2 majority on the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, so the elections mean control is on the line. The races have attracted national spending -- both for and against keeping the justices. It is quite rare for a Pennsylvania justice to lose a retention race: The last time it happened was in 2005.\n\nTexas\n\nMost polls close at 8 p.m. Eastern time.\n\nThe key races: An open seat in Texas' 18th Congressional District, with 16 candidates vying for the seat.\n\nWhy it matters: The Houston-based district has been without representation for months following the death of Rep. Sylvester Turner in March. Today's election is a special election called by Gov. Greg Abbott, meaning there was no primary to winnow down the numerous candidates. If no one gets a clean majority of the votes, Abbott will have to call another special election for a runoff.\n\nNext year, the district will be redivided for March's primary races under the state's new Republican-led congressional map. A large majority of voters currently in the district will be drawn out. The new district lines will make the seat even bluer, meaning whoever wins today will still have an advantage next year.\n\nIt's unclear when whoever wins today's race will be sworn into the House. House Speaker Mike Johnson has not sworn in Rep.-elect Adelita Grijalva, who won her special election in Arizona in September. Johnson has kept the House out of Washington since late September to pressure the Senate into passing a Republican bill to reopen the government.\n\nIf a Democrat wins tomorrow as expected, Grijalva and the winner in Houston would place the Republican majority at 219-215 once sworn in, meaning Republicans could lose only one vote in future votes.\n\nVirginia\n\nPolls close at 7 p.m. Eastern time.\n\nThe key races: For governor, Democrat Abigail Spanberger versus Republican Winsome Earle-Sears. For lieutenant governor, Democrat Ghazala Hashmi versus Republican John Reid. For attorney general, Democrat Jay Jones versus Republican Jason Miyares.\n\nWhy it matters: The off-year statewide campaigns in Virginia have long been closely watched to decipher the nation's political mood. However, the state's races this year are more likely to serve as a barometer for how Democratic voters feel about the Trump administration's attacks on the federal government and the current government shutdown.\n\nSpanberger has had a consistent lead in polling and is expected to win on Tuesday night, flipping the governor's mansion four years after Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin won the job. A key question on Tuesday will be whether Spanberger's consistent lead is enough to keep Jones ahead of Miyares after the Democrat's violent texting scandal roiled the race.\n\nTexts Jones sent, including about shooting a political rival, forced Democrats to grapple with whether they would back a candidate who used violent rhetoric after having attacked Republicans for doing the same. The scandal has tightened Jones's race and threatens to make this year the first time in two decades that Virginia voters might split their tickets in the off-year statewide elections.\n\nGet ready with The Post\n\nIn your local paper\n\nThe Texas Tribune: Texans will vote on 17 ballot measures today, amending the state constitution on a host of issues, from capital gains taxes to parents' rights in their children's upbringing.\n\nPortland Press Herald: Mainers will vote on a ballot measure today requiring photo IDs to vote in future elections. Supporters say it improves election integrity, but opponents fear it'll disenfranchise Indigenous voters.\n\nDetroit Free Press: Detroit has a mayoral election today that blew up over the weekend amid allegations of corruption.\n\nSend us a reply\n\nToday is Election Day, the moment when our readers can officially voice their opinions about this moment and the candidates running in their states.

        "title": "California's 'Prop 50' congressional map election could have major impact for midterms",
        "description": "One of 2025's major elections could have major implications for the midterms.\n\nOne of 2025's major elections could have major reverberations for the 2026 midterms.\n\nCalifornians are voting on a ballot initiative, \"Proposition 50,\" to determine if the state will adopt a new congressional map that redraws five districts to be more Democratic-leaning, potentially allowing Democrats to flip them in the midterms.\n\nSupporters of Proposition 50 -- including California Gov. Gavin Newsom and former President Barack Obama -- have pushed for the new map.\n\nTexas Republicans, encouraged by President Donald Trump, revised their maps in a rare mid-decade redistricting move that could allow Republicans to gain five seats in 2026 -- and insulate the GOP from the historic midterm headwinds a president's party can face.\n\n\"We have a chance at least to create a level playing field in the upcoming midterm elections,\" Obama said during a recent call with supporters of the campaign to vote \"yes\".\n\nHannah Milgrom, a spokesperson for Yes on 50, the political committee supported by Newsom, told ABC News that the group has been working with over 230 community organizations on the ground.\n\nNational Democrats have largely supported the initiative, hoping it will be the first of other Democratic efforts to push back on Republican-led redistricting in Texas, Missouri, and other states.\n\nBut Rep. Kevin Kiley, a California Republican whose district would be reshaped and made significantly more Democratic-leaning, told ABC News partisan gerrymandering is a \"plague on democracy,\" and has unsuccessfully pushed House Speaker Mike Johnson to take up a bill banning the practice.\n\n\"I think it takes power away from voters, undermines the fairness of elections and degrades representative government,\" he said.\n\nSpokespeople for two of the political committees opposing Proposition 50, which are supported by megadonor Charles T. Munger Jr. and former Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy, respectively, told ABC News they were focused in the final weeks before the election on reaching persuadable voters and to emphasizing arguments about allowing voters to choose their politicians, not the other way around.\n\nActor and former governor of California Arnold Schwarzenegger, who supported independent redistricting as governor, has also spoken out against the proposition. He said in September, \"If you vote yes on that, you're going backwards.\"\n\n\"Prop 50 will have a big impact on the midterms ... the U.S. House margin right now is so narrow that every seat in every state could make a difference for which party controls Congress,\" Christian Grose, a professor of political science at the University of Southern California, told ABC News.\n\nIf the proposition passes, Grose added, a large margin of support could signal to Democratic donors that there's enthusiasm for the party -- and could impact whether other blue or red states decide to redraw their congressional maps as well.\n\nGrose said Democrats are likely more fired up in part because campaigning towards Democratic voters is how to win with ballot propositions in California, Grose said, but also because of what they see as national stakes: \"Democrats, maybe nationally, are viewing things as an existential threat; are viewing Trump as an existential threat. So anything that pushes back against Trump, anything that helps Democrats, is resonating.\"",

        "title": "Why Trump's agenda is on voter's minds even if he's not on the 2025 ballot",
        "description": "Proposition 50 sparks debate over redistricting in California. It will play a substantial role in deciding which party controls the U.S. House.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's juggernaut second-term agenda that has swept across the nation will receive its first major referendum as millions of voters flock to the polls for a handful of critical off-year elections.\n\nDemocrats and their allies who have been locked out of power in Washington since January have scrambled to organize opposition in many ways, including holding marathon speeches in Congress, filing lawsuits against the administration's controversial moves and filling up the streets with mass protests.\n\nBut the Nov. 4 contests present the clearest political judgment yet of Trump's expanding dominance to date that will also set the table for the future of his Make America Great Again movement, next year's midterm elections and the not-to-distant 2028 presidential contest.\n\nIn every race, whether the two elections for governor in New Jersey and Virginia, the theatrical sprint for New York City mayor; or California's bold entry into the redistricting arms race, Trump is evoked, oftentimes to galvanize his supporters or alarm his opponents.\n\nThese elections are going to also be used as a yardstick measuring the direction and success of Democrats, who are featuring two contenders - Abigail Spanberger in Virginia and Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey - who were part of the party's 2018 successes in combating Trump during his first term midterm election.\n\n\"What's interesting about both is that they really embody the first part of the political resistance to Donald Trump,\" said Matthew Dallek, a historian and professor of political management at George Washington University.\n\n\"I don't think it's an accident that you have two candidates who emerged from the Trump 1.0 resistance who are both favored to win these really important off-year gubernatorial elections,\" he added. \"It suggests that the kind of patriotic, pro-national security, tough-on-Law-and-Order mold still resonates within the Democratic Party, and it may well still resonate among the general electorate.\"\n\nBut part of the Democrat's yearlong re-brand is a growing and radical progressive populism embodied by New York Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani, a socialist-aligned candidate who is winning over mainstream Democrats and on the verge of running the largest U.S. city after awakening the political left.\n\nAs the president tests the limits of his executive authority and takes a bulldozer -- in some cases literally -- approach to changing Washington and the country, the ramifications for Republicans and Democrats are going to be played out in these results.\n\nA MAGA upset would rock Dems 2026 hopes\n\nPolitical forecasters and pollsters are mostly giving Democrats the edge in every race, and sweeping those contests would paint a more liberal portrait going into next year that Americans are increasingly dissatisfied with Trump's sterns actions.\n\nBut MAGA activists and other conservative-leaning leaders believe that Republicans can stop that narrative from taking root in 2026, when Democrats hope to take back the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\n\"If the Democrats don't win New Jersey and Virginia by significant margins, it's blunted,\" John Fredericks, a Trump ally and conservative radio host in Virginia, told USA TODAY.\n\nRepublicans see their best hope in New Jersey, where GOP gubernatorial nominee Jack Ciattarelli has fully embraced Trump and the MAGA presence in this campaign after rejecting him in his previous bid for governor in 2021, where he lost by a razor-thin margin.\n\nTrump has mostly stayed away from the campaign trail in 2025, but Ciaterrelli told the USA TODAY Network that he speaks to the president regularly, underscoring that any association with commander-in-chief must be handled carefully.\n\nConservative commentators argue liberals should coast to victory in these two states given that Trump lost them in last year's presidential election.\n\nIf Ciattarelli prevails, it would make the 63-year-old former assemblyman a MAGA star and credit him with stiff arming Democrats.\n\nMost prognosticators don't believe votes will deliver Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears an upset over Spanberger in Virginia, however, and conservatives in the Old Dominion State talk more about other Republicans, such as lieutenant governor candidate John Reid, a rising figure in the MAGA ranks.\n\nIn the race for Virginia attorney general candidate, for instance, Republicans have spent more on aiding GOP nominee Jason Miyares in the final weeks than on the governor's race.\n\nBut the stability of Trump's coalition without him at the helm will be in question if Democrats win in New Jersey. That may explain why some allies such as former White House advisor Steve Bannon are pushing for an unconstitutional third term that the president has also toyed with at some points and downplayed at others.\n\nTrumpism's future will be as much a part of the national conversation in 2026 for Republicans as it will be for Democrats.\n\nOn the GOP side, there are emerging cracks in the MAGA movement, whether it is right-wing gripes over U.S. ties to Israel; grumblings over releasing files connected to the Jeffrey Epstein child sex trafficking case; or rising concerns about millions losing food benefits or skyrocketing health care premiums amid the ongoing federal government shutdown.\n\nBut Federicks said a good showing for Republicans in any of these off-year races gives the president and his allies more enthusiasm, and will reverse concerns among GOP voters who fret that Trump's last two years in office will be a slog if Democrats did take back control of either chamber in Congress.\n\n\"The national narrative goes from, 'Oh, Trump is done, they're going to impeach him' and they lose 25 seats to 'holy crap, here's two states that are not red that really seem to like what the president's doing,' and maybe they pick up seats,\" he said.\n\nDemocratic campaigns offer differing comeback paths\n\nDemocrats are figuring out a much more compelling - and complicated - puzzle of their own going into next year as the Nov. 4 results will help show how the party is figuring out how it can outpace MAGA amid Trump's expanding authority as president.\n\nIn one lane there is Mamdani, a 34-year-old member of the Democratic Socialists of America whose online fluency and pledges to attack New York's rising costs for regular people has awakened a new generation of progressives ready for their own populist movement.\n\nThat rise is in sharp contrast to the Virginia and New Jersey campaigns, where Democrats have put forward less viral but more predictable contenders in Spanberger and Sherill.\n\nThe two former Capitol Hill roommates both have national security backgrounds and offer platforms that speak to the affordability crisis, too. But their messages avoid stark class attacks on billionaires and are more aimed at winning over swing voters rather than recruiting new supporters with progressive tilts.\n\nSherill initially praised Mamdani's focus on costs and raising government efficiency standards, for instance. But the 53-year-old Democratic congresswoman who currently represents the New Jersey suburbs west of New York backed off in the last stretch of the gubernatorial campaign after a round of GOP attacks, telling reporters after her Oct. 9 debate with Ciaterrelli that she is \"not getting involved\" in New York's mayoral race.\n\nHow Democratic candidates and incumbents responded to Mamdani served as a source of conflict during his campaign.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., finally endorsed Mamdani after weeks of questions and demands from the liberal base. Comedian Jon Stewart mocked Jeffries for his tardiness in an October interview, sarcastically calling it a \"brave, brave endorsement\" by the Democratic establishment.\n\n\"We're living in an outsider moment,\" Adam Green, co-founder of the influential Progressive Change Campaign Committee, told USA TODAY. \"Today's politics are not about left versus right. They're more accurately about outsider rage versus creatures of the inside.\"\n\nProgressives running in 2026 and beyond are on the lookout for a Mamdani win with 50% or more of the vote, as well as a possible Sherill loss. If that happens, the left is expected to try taking even bolder positions on populist values, such as challenging the role billionaires play in politics and the economy.\n\nShould Sherill prevail - polling indicates New Jersey is a dead heat - it will encourage more moderate voices in next year's midterms and beyond who will argue that outside of urban centers, such as New York City, the party must vie for less ideologically-aligned voters.\n\nAn Oct. 29 survey by Quinnipiac University found Mamdani holding a 10% lead in his battle with Cuomo overall, and a commanding 28% lead among Democratic voters. But among independents the two were tied at 34%.\n\nCalifornia enters redistricting wars as 2028 jockeying begins\n\nOutside of the candidate-versus-candidates horserace, California's entry into the redistricting battle carries a much wider ramification going forward.\n\nVoters in the Golden State are set decide on a Nov. 4 ballot initiative, known as Proposition 50, that would allow legislators to redraw their 52-member congressional boundaries instead of a nonpartisan commission. Democrats are hoping to create five new seats out of California that would be in their favor.\n\nCalifornia Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom has spearheaded the fight, which makes this a national test of his political might that has been set up as a daring challenge against Trump and his allies as they pressure several GOP-controlled states to redo their maps in order to keep a majority in Congress.\n\nRecent polling gives Proposition 50 the edge heading into Election Day, but political experts say the California governor will have to win big or risk losing some luster as he traverses through a shadow 2028 presidential primary that so far lacks a clear favorite.\n\nOther would-be White House contenders are also already making their own moves in the fall elections that could help set up possible 2028 bids.\n\nFormer Vice President Kamala Harris, a fellow Californian, hasn't ruled out another White House run amid her book tour, but like Trump she's been off the 2025 campaign trail as Democrats still digest last year's loss.\n\nOthers such as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, are taking more visible roles that add to their profile. Ocasio-Cortez has been rallying for Mamdani in the New York City mayoral race and Beshear, who will be leading Democratic Governor's Association in 2026, has lent his voice to Spanberger in Virginia.\n\nThen there is Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, one of the highest profile contenders rumored to be running for president who faces a reelection bid of his own in 2026. He holds a 60% approval rating in his state, according to surveys, and has been wielding that popularity in state Supreme Court races this November that national Democrats have put their weight behind to protect Pennsylvania's 5-2 liberal majority.\n\nKeystone State voters will decide on Nov. 4 whether to extend the terms of three Democratic-leaning justices in a race that Shapiro has pitched as a referendum on \"the threats to our freedoms.\"\n\n\"They've proven we can count on them to protect a woman's access to abortion and birth control -- and stand up for all our freedoms,\" Shapiro said in a 30-second spot supporting the justices.",

        "title": "A Guide to the California Special Election and Prop. 50 Ballot Measure",
        "description": "Kevin Yamamura reported from Sacramento, and Soumya Karlamangla from San Francisco.\n\nMillions of Californians will vote Tuesday in a special election to decide only one question: whether the state should redraw its voting district maps to help Democrats flip as many as five House seats in the 2026 midterms.\n\nThe measure, Proposition 50, came together at a breakneck pace this summer as the brainchild of Gov. Gavin Newsom, House Democrats and state lawmakers. They wanted to counter Republicans in Texas and other states who were gerrymandering maps at the request of President Trump, who has engaged in a national redistricting effort aimed at keeping his party in control of Congress during the second half of his term.\n\nThe California ballot measure asks voters whether the state should suspend its independent process and adopt new congressional districts that are expected to favor Democrats, starting next year.\n\nWith recent polls indicating that the measure was likely to pass, Republicans all but abandoned the airwaves in the last stretch of the campaign. But turnout in California can be difficult to predict, especially in a so-called off-year contest like this one.\n\nHere's what you should know about the election:\n\nHow do I vote?\n\nPolls will be open Tuesday between 7 a.m. and 8 p.m. Pacific time. Voters who arrive by 8 p.m. should stay in line even after polls close because they still have the right to vote.\n\nYou can still mail in your ballot, but you have to make sure that it gets a Tuesday postmark for it to count. For that reason, election officials have advised last-minute voters to head to vote centers or election offices to be certain that their ballots are cast in time. That is particularly the case in rural areas, where changes at the U.S. Postal Service have slowed postmarking.\n\nYou can find your closest polling place through the California Secretary of State website.\n\nAs of Sunday, more than 6 million of California's 23 million voters had already submitted a ballot, according to the California Secretary of State's office.\n\nWhat if I did not receive a ballot?\n\nCalifornia still offers same-day registration, which allows you to use a provisional ballot to vote on Tuesday. You must head to your local elections office or a vote center to use this option.\n\nAfter a provisional ballot is submitted, registrars check to make sure that you are eligible to participate and have not already voted.\n\nWhen will we know the results?\n\nPolls will close at 8 p.m. local time. If the contest is lopsided, the outcome should be known on election night. If the results are close, it could be weeks before the race is called.\n\nWhat's on the ballot?\n\nProposition 50 asks voters whether the state should temporarily approve redrawn House districts for the next three election cycles. The proposed boundaries have been drawn in a way that would most likely lead to more Democrats being elected to Congress.\n\nThe state has 43 Democrats and nine Republicans in the House. Proposition 50 could help Democrats flip as many as five of the Republican-held seats. It could also help Democrats make several swing seats easier to win.\n\nThe ballot measure would restore California's independent redistricting process in 2031, when a commission would draw boundaries based on the 2030 census results and the criteria set forth in the State Constitution.\n\nWho supports the measure?\n\nMr. Newsom and Democratic state lawmakers placed Proposition 50 on the ballot in August to counter gerrymandering efforts in Texas and other states. Texas leaders enacted new maps at the request of Mr. Trump, who wanted to find ways for Republicans to retain control of the House and pass his agenda over the last two years of his term.\n\nMr. Newsom has argued that Democrats needed to respond by gerrymandering their own districts and giving their party a fighting chance in the 2026 midterms. Besides the governor and Democratic state lawmakers, supporters include labor unions, the progressive donor George Soros, House Democrats, former Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Barack Obama.\n\nWho opposes the measure?\n\nRepublicans oppose Proposition 50 and say that the state should retain the boundaries already drawn by its independent commission. Among the most notable opponents are former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a moderate Republican who championed independent redistricting in California; the state's Republican Party; House Republicans; and Kevin McCarthy, a former speaker of the House.\n\nThe opposition campaign received the bulk of its funding from Charles Munger Jr., who is a physicist and a wealthy heir of Charles T. Munger, partner of Warren E. Buffett at Berkshire Hathaway.\n\nThe younger Mr. Munger was a prominent backer of independent redistricting in California when voters installed it in two separate elections in 2008 and 2010.\n\nMr. Schwarzenegger and Mr. Munger have argued for years that voters should not allow politicians to draw their own boundaries or create extreme districts that benefit the party in power. They have made the case that competition in each district is healthy for democracy.\n\nRepublicans have already challenged Proposition 50 in court and have vowed to file more lawsuits if voters approve the measure.\n\nIs it as simple as voting with my party?\n\nMr. Newsom has argued that voting for Proposition 50 is the best way for Californians to stop Mr. Trump. Republicans have made it less about Mr. Trump and focused on calling it a \"power grab\" by California Democrats who want to draw their own district lines.\n\nSome groups have had a difficult time deciding which way to go.\n\nThe state's League of Women Voters branch and California Common Cause, two nonpartisan groups, initially opposed Mr. Newsom's gerrymandering idea because it bucked the principle of independent redistricting. But both groups later went neutral on Proposition 50. Common Cause's national board determined that Mr. Newsom's approach was acceptable because he was countering partisan redistricting in Texas.\n\nMr. Newsom has said that he supports independent redistricting in principle. But he argues that Democrats must fight fire with fire by gerrymandering districts where they can, even if it means suspending California's rules until the next census.\n\nSome California Republicans have said that they oppose mid-decade gerrymandering in all states, including the effort Mr. Trump instigated in Texas. For instance, Representative Kevin Kiley, whose district includes a long stretch of rural Sierra Nevada counties, has proposed legislation in the House that would block mid-decade redistricting across the country. If Proposition 50 were approved, Mr. Kiley would be among the most vulnerable House Republicans.\n\nMid-decade redistricting efforts have gone beyond Texas and California. Other states are pursuing changes that could benefit Republicans in House races, while Democratic-led states generally have a more difficult path to redrawing their boundaries before the midterms.\n\nLaurel Rosenhall contributed reporting from Sacramento.",

        "title": "Five big questions for Trump and Democrats on Election Day 2025",
        "description": "Voters are casting ballots Tuesday in several off-year elections, including bruising governor's contests in Virginia and New Jersey, a competition full of plot twists to be mayor of New York, and a referendum in California on whether to redraw congressional lines to help Democrats in a broader fight over redistricting.\n\nThe races will offer a snapshot of voter attitudes one year after President Donald Trump won a second term and Democrats were shut out of power in Washington. While only a handful of mostly Democratic-leaning states are voting, strategists in both parties will be looking for clues about how people feel about Trump's agenda and Democrats' rebuilding efforts before the country votes in the 2026 midterms.\n\nHere are five big questions for Election Day 2025:\n\nIn this article\n\nWhat message will voters send about Trump?\n\nReturn to menu\n\nWhile Trump is not on the ballot, Democrats have sought to turn the marquee races in part into referendums on his presidency, with polls showing his approval rating in negative territory.\n\nA large portion of pro-Democrat ads in the 2025 general election in New Jersey and Virginia mentioned Trump, according to data from AdImpact. Democrats spent nearly $18 million on general election ads there mentioning Trump, investing $34.4 million on ads that did not. By comparison, Republicans spent $1.3 million on ads in those states mentioning Trump and $37.7 million on ads that did not.\n\nThe Democratic gubernatorial nominee in Virginia, Abigail Spanberger, has argued that the cost of living for voters in her home state is too high, pointing in part to the president's trade agenda, U.S. DOGE Service cuts and the ongoing government shutdown. New Jersey Democratic gubernatorial nominee Mikie Sherrill rarely misses an opportunity to tie her opponent to the president. In California, Democrats have focused heavily on Trump, hoping to capitalize on blue state anger with the president to pass a new congressional map.\n\nDemocrats have spent nearly a decade campaigning against Trump in a range of elections. If they are successful Tuesday in races where they ran heavily against the president, it could fuel efforts to reprise the strategies in the midterms. If not, the outcomes might prompt calls in the party to focus their energy on other matters.\n\nThe election will also test Republicans' ability to overcome Trump's low approval ratings and appeal to his loyal political base. New Jersey GOP gubernatorial nominee Jack Ciattarelli, for example, has aligned himself with Trump but downplayed the president's role in the contest.\n\nThere are also questions about whether Trump's supporters -- which included an expanded coalition in 2024 after he made inroads with Latino voters, first-time voters and others -- will show up for Republicans when he is not on the ballot. Trump himself has not been especially active in this year's campaigns.\n\nWill Mikie Sherrill hang on in New Jersey, or will Republicans spring an upset?\n\nReturn to menu\n\nThe open race for governor of New Jersey has narrowed in recent weeks, with polls showing Sherrill leading Ciattarelli by single digits. Democrats have long hoped for a clean sweep of this year's governor's races. They hold a clear advantage in Virginia, but New Jersey is not a sure bet.\n\nThough New Jersey is blue-leaning, Ciattarelli has returned as a competitive candidate in the gubernatorial race. He outperformed pre-election polls and fell three points short of winning the race against incumbent Gov. Phil Murphy (D) four years ago.\n\nThis time around, Democrats are feeling the squeeze from voters who have soured on Murphy and the Democratic-controlled state legislature -- particularly over their handling of cost-of-living issues. In addition, their gubernatorial candidate in the open race, Sherrill, has been scrutinized for being too buttoned up on the campaign trail.\n\nCiattarelli, a businessman and former state lawmaker, is a former Trump critic turned supporter who is running with the president's endorsement. Sherrill, a Navy veteran who in 2018 flipped a House district held by Republicans for decades, is attempting to convince voters that she would be a change agent as governor, making an ambitious pledge to put a freeze on electric utility rates and stand up to Trump.\n\nIn the final stretch of the contest, both candidates have focused on the cost of living, deploying television ads highlighting their efforts to combat high costs in the Garden State. Sherrill pledged in a final ad of the campaign to drive costs down. And Ciattarelli similarly vowed to tackle unaffordability, saying, \"housing, tax and electricity bills are crushing the middle class.\"\n\nRepublicans are hoping Ciattarelli can capitalize on the inroads Trump made in the blue state in 2024. No state besides New York shifted more toward Trump than New Jersey. He lost by about six percentage points, compared to his roughly 16-point defeat in 2020. However, Trump's endorsement doesn't clearly spell good news for Ciattarelli's gubernatorial prospects, given that the president's approval rating is now underwater in New Jersey.\n\nHow much of a problem will Jay Jones pose for Virginia Democrats? Will Republicans capitalize?\n\nReturn to menu\n\nThe other high-profile contest Republicans are hopeful about is the race for attorney general in Virginia.\n\nRepublicans in the state have seized on the recent revelation that the Democratic nominee for attorney general, Jay Jones, sent text messages to a lawmaker in 2022 describing a hypothetical scenario of shooting the Republican speaker of the Virginia House and discussing urinating on the future graves of other political opponents. Jones has since apologized, but Republicans -- including Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, the nominee for governor -- have released ads seeking to tie Democratic campaigns to Jones's controversy.\n\nDemocrats have largely stood behind Jones, even as they condemned his texts -- worrying some in the party who want to draw a firm line against political violence and violent rhetoric, and prompting accusations of hypocrisy from Republicans.\n\nThe incumbent, state Attorney General Jason Miyares (R), has Trump's explicit endorsement. Miyares has been sharply critical of Jones.\n\nWhile Spanberger has held a 12-point lead over Earle-Sears in the latest Washington Post-Schar School poll, support for Jones dropped by five percentage points compared with last month, leaving him tied with Miyares.\n\nWill democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani cement his meteoric rise in New York?\n\nReturn to menu\n\nNo other politician this year has catapulted from relative obscurity to the national radar like Zohran Mamdani, a left-wing State Assembly member who polls show is favored to be elected the next mayor of New York on Tuesday.\n\nIn a race that also includes former New York governor Andrew M. Cuomo and Republican Curtis Sliwa, Mamdani, 34, has embraced social media to build a movement around his candidacy, zeroing in on affordability as a core message. He has championed ideas such as free public transportation, city-run grocery stores and universal child care, while also pursuing higher taxes on wealthier residents.\n\nIf he wins, party establishment figures who were slow to endorse Mamdani's candidacy are likely to face more questions about his governance. And his dynamic with Trump, who has suggested Mamdani would face \"problems with Washington like no Mayor in the history of our once-great city,\" while Mamdani has called himself \"Donald Trump's worst nightmare,\" will also be under the spotlight. Trump endorsed Cuomo on Monday.\n\nIn a Democratic Party desperate to elevate new and compelling voices, Mamdani's rise has been a refreshing development for some who see him as a strong communicator. But it's been cause for concern for others, who worry that GOP attempts to cast Democrats as extremists will be more effective with a prominent democratic socialist elected to lead the country's most populous city. Some have also been troubled by Mamdani's comments about Israel. Mamdani, who would become the first Muslim mayor of a city that has the largest Jewish and Muslim populations in the country, has said he does not believe Israel should exist as a Jewish state.\n\nAt the same time, Mamdani, an Indian American born in Uganda, has faced Islamophobic attacks from Republican lawmakers and commentators.\n\nWill Democrats land their most significant counterpunch against Trump on redistricting?\n\nReturn to menu\n\nCalifornia voters are set to decide on Proposition 50 on Tuesday -- a statewide ballot measure Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) is pushing that could serve as Democrats' first concrete counterpunch against Republican efforts in several states to redraw congressional district maps in their favor. Polls show it is favored to succeed. If it does, the state can bypass its independent redistricting commission and adopt a new map that could add up to five Democratic U.S. House seats.\n\nThe battle over redistricting in California has attracted massive spending and big-name surrogates, with Newsom's committee bringing in former president Barack Obama and other nationally known Democrats to star in ads supporting Prop 50 and framing the campaign as a way to fight Trump directly.\n\nThe strategy marked a shift for many Democrats, including Obama, who had previously advocated against partisan gerrymandering.\n\nWhile some opponents, including Charles Munger Jr., a Stanford physicist and Berkshire Hathaway heir, have spent considerable sums trying to defeat the measure, the money chase has been one-sided, favoring Newsom and his allies.\n\nThe election has no recent precedent, leaving open the possibility of a surprise. But Prop 50's advocates, including Newsom, have sounded confident notes. For Newsom, a win would also be a welcome accomplishment ahead of a 2028 presidential campaign many Democrats expect him to launch.",

        "title": "Trump looms large over key Election Day 2025 contests despite not being on ballot",
        "description": "Jack Ciattarelli, the Republican nominee for governor in New Jersey, tells Fox News Digital that President Donald Trump's efforts to energize the GOP base ahead of Tuesday's election are appreciated.\n\nNearly ten months into President Donald Trump's second term in the White House, voters in contests from coast-to-coast head to the polls on Tuesday in statewide and local elections.\n\nAnd the key showdowns, including gubernatorial elections in New Jersey and Virginia, are viewed, in part, as the first major ballot box test of Trump's unprecedented and explosive second-term agenda.\n\n\"FAILING TO VOTE TOMORROW IS THE SAME AS VOTING FOR A DEMOCRAT,\" the president charged in a social media post on Election Eve as he urged Republicans to head to the polls.\n\nGrabbing top billing are New Jersey and Virginia, the only two states to hold contests for governor in the year after a presidential election. Their gubernatorial races typically receive outsized national attention and are seen as a key barometer ahead of next year's midterms when the GOP will be defending its slim House and Senate majorities.\n\nTRUMP MAKES LAST MINUTE PITCH FOR REPUBLICANS ON EVE OF 2025 ELECTIONS\n\nAlso in the political spotlight on Election Day 2025 is New York City's high-profile mayoral showdown, where 34-year-old democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani is on the verge of making history, the blockbuster ballot box proposition over congressional redistricting in California, the nation's most populous state and three state Supreme Court contests in battleground Pennsylvania.\n\nHere's what's at stake.\n\nRepublican Jack Ciattarelli, who's making his third straight run for Garden State governor and who nearly upset Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy four years ago, is optimistic he can pull off a victory in blue-leaning New Jersey.\n\nIn a state where registered Democrats still outnumber Republicans despite a GOP surge in registration this decade, Ciattarelli appeared to be closing the gap in recent weeks with Democratic rival Rep. Mikie Sherrill.\n\nTRUMP-BACKED CIATTARELLI GETS MAJOR SURPRISE ON ELECTION EVE\n\nWhile Democrats have long dominated federal and state legislative elections in New Jersey, Republicans are very competitive in gubernatorial contests, winning five out of the past 10 elections.\n\nAnd Trump made major gains in New Jersey in last year's presidential election, losing the state by only six percentage points, a major improvement over his 16-point deficit four years earlier.\n\nThe president, whose poll numbers are underwater among New Jersey voters, headlined two tele-rallies for Ciattarelli in the final stretch of the campaign in hopes of energizing MAGA supporters, many of whom are low propensity voters who often skip casting ballots in non-presidential election years.\n\n\"We appreciate what the president is doing to get the base excited, and remind them that they got to vote, as do all New Jerseyans. The future of our state hangs in the balance. Get out and vote,\" Ciattarelli told Fox News Digital on Monday after a campaign stop in this northern New Jersey borough.\n\nTRUMP TAPS MASSIVE WARCHEST TO ENERGIZE MAGA VOTERS IN ELECTION 2025 FINAL PUSH\n\nBut in a state where Trump's poll numbers are underwater, Sherrill has regularly linked Ciattarelli to the president, charging that her GOP rival \"has really gone in lockstep with the president, giving him an A.\"\n\nThe race in New Jersey was rocked earlier this autumn by a report that the National Personnel Records Center, which is a branch of the National Archives and Records Administration, mistakenly released Sherrill's improperly redacted military personnel files, which included private information like her Social Security number, to a Ciattarelli ally.\n\nBut Sherrill's military records indicated that the United States Naval Academy blocked her from taking part in her 1994 graduation amid a cheating scandal.\n\nSherrill, who was never accused of cheating in the scandal, went on to serve nearly a decade in the Navy.\n\nThe showdown was jolted again during last month's final debate after Sherrill's allegations that Ciattarelli was \"complicit\" with pharmaceutical companies in the opioid deaths of tens of thousands of New Jerseyans, as she pointed to the medical publishing company he owned that pushed content promoting the use of opioids as a low-risk treatment for chronic pain.\n\nExplosive revelations in Virginia's attorney general race that the GOP aimed to leverage up and down the ballot recently shook up the state's race for governor, forcing Democratic Party nominee, former Rep. Abigail Spanberger, back on defense in a campaign where she was seen as the frontrunner against Republican rival Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears.\n\nVirginia attorney general Democratic nominee Jay Jones was in crisis mode after controversial texts were first reported earlier this fall by the National Review.\n\nJones acknowledged and apologized for texts he sent in 2022, when he compared then-Virginia House Speaker Todd Gilbert to mass murderers Adolf Hitler and Pol Pot, adding that if he was given two bullets, he would use both against the GOP lawmaker to shoot him in the head.\n\nBut he faced a chorus of calls from Republicans to drop out of the race.\n\nEarle-Sears didn't waste an opportunity to link Spanberger to Jones. And during last month's chaotic and only gubernatorial debate, where Earle-Sears repeatedly interrupted Spanberger, the GOP gubernatorial nominee called on her Democratic rival to tell Jones to end his attorney general bid.\n\nFOR THE LATEST FOX NEWS REPORTING ON THE VIRGINIA SHOWDOWN, HEAD HERE\n\n\"The comments that Jay Jones made are absolutely abhorrent,\" Spanberger said at the debate. But she neither affirmed nor pulled back her support of Jones.\n\nThe winner will succeed term-limited GOP Gov. Glenn Youngkin.\n\nThe mayoral election in the nation's most populous city always grabs outsized attention, especially this year as New York City may elect its first Muslim and first millennial mayor.\n\nMamdani's victory in June's Democratic Party mayoral primary in the deep blue city sent political shock waves across the country. And he's come under attack from Republicans and from his rivals on the ballot over his far-left proposals.\n\nMamdani is facing off against former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who came in a distant second in the primary and is now running as an independent candidate. Cuomo is aiming for a political comeback after resigning as governor four years ago amid multiple scandals.\n\nTHE LATEST FOX NEWS REPORTING ON THE NEW YORK CITY MAYORAL ELECTION IS RIGHT HERE\n\nAlso running is two-time Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa, a co-founder of the Guardian Angels, the non-profit, volunteer-based community safety group.\n\nEmbattled Mayor Eric Adams, a Democrat who was running for re-election as an independent, dropped out of the race last month. He recently backed Cuomo, but his name remains on the ballot.\n\nVoters in heavily blue California will vote in November on whether to set aside their popular nonpartisan redistricting commission for the rest of the decade and allow the Democrat-dominated legislature to determine congressional redistricting for the next three election cycles.\n\nHEAD HERE FOR THE LATEST FOX NEWS REPORTING ON THE 2025 ELECTIONS\n\nThe vote will be the culmination of an effort by Gov. Gavin Newsom and California Democrats to create up to five left-leaning congressional seats in the Golden State to counter the new maps that conservative Gov. Greg Abbott signed into law a couple of months ago, which will create up to five more right-leaning U.S. House districts in the red state of Texas.\n\nThe redistricting in Texas, which came after Trump's urging, is part of a broader effort by the GOP across the country to pad their razor-thin House majority to keep control of the chamber in the 2026 midterms when the party in power traditionally faces political headwinds and loses seats.\n\nTrump is aiming to avoid a repeat of the 2018 midterms, during his first term in office, when Republicans lost control of the House.\n\nDemocrats currently hold a 5-2 majority on the Supreme Court in the northeastern battleground of Pennsylvania.\n\nBut three Democrat-leaning justices on the state Supreme Court, following the completion of their 10-year terms, are running this year to keep their seats in \"Yes\" or \"No\" retention elections.\n\nThe election could upend the court's composition for the next decade, heavily influence whether Democrats or Republicans have an advantage in the state's congressional delegation and legislature, and impact crucial cases including voting rights and reproductive rights.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nWhile state Supreme Court elections typically don't grab much national attention, contests where the balance of a court in a key battleground state is up for grabs have attracted tons of outside money.\n\nThe state Supreme Court showdown this spring in Wisconsin, where the 4-3 liberal majority was maintained, drew nearly $100 million in outside money as both parties poured resources into the election.",

        "description": "The biggest contests are in Virginia and New Jersey, the only states electing governors this year.\n\nBy STEVE PEOPLES and WILL WEISSERT, Associated Press\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Tuesday marks the nation's first major Election Day since President Donald Trump returned to the White House, and his leadership and policies dominated the debate in almost every race -- even though the Republican was absent from the campaign trail.\n\nThe biggest contests are in Virginia and New Jersey, the only states electing governors this year. Trump lost both last fall, but voters in each have a history of electing Republicans for statewide office. The GOP candidates have closely aligned themselves with the president, betting that his big win last year can still provide a path to victory this time, even if the party occupying the White House typically suffers in off-year elections.\n\nStrong Democratic showings, meanwhile, could provide the party a pathway back to national relevance -- even if its top candidates have taken very different approaches, from adhering to a moderate line to wholeheartedly embracing government spending to improve voters' lives.\n\nIn New York City, a self-described democratic socialist who already has been a target of Trump's criticism could emerge as a national star if elected mayor. And California voters will decide whether to redraw the state's House map, as Democrats look to counter a push by Trump to reshape the balance of congressional power.\n\nHere's what to watch:\n\nThe president did not set foot in either Virginia or New Jersey to campaign with Republican gubernatorial candidates Winsome Earle-Sears or Jack Ciattarelli, but both contests will likely be viewed as a referendum on Trump's job so far.\n\nOver the last year, his tariffs rocked the global economy, his \"big, beautiful\" budget bill threatened rural hospitals and health insurance coverage for millions, he enacted massive cuts to the federal workforce and he sent the National Guard to multiple American cities.\n\nThe president endorsed Ciattarelli in New Jersey's governor's race, but held only a pair of tele-town halls on his behalf, including one Monday night. Trump also did an Election Night eve tele-town hall for Virginia Republican candidates, but he did not mention Earle-Sears, speaking mostly in favor of the GOP candidate for attorney general. Earlier in the campaign, Trump gave Earle-Sears only a half-hearted endorsement, saying he supported the GOP candidate for governor though he did not use her name. Earle-Sears was nonetheless a fierce defender of Trump and his policies, just as Ciattarelli was in New Jersey.\n\nDespite Trump's distance, a good night for Republicans would almost certainly be viewed as a political victory for Trump and his \"Make America Great Again\" policies. A bad night for the GOP would give Democrats a strong -- though perhaps fleeting -- start heading into midterms that are still a year away.\n\nTuesday offers a test of two very different Democratic philosophies on display from candidates: toeing a moderate line or fully embracing far-left progressivism. But it also presents a scenario where both, or neither, could be successful -- making drawing conclusions going forward more difficult.\n\nThe party's candidates for governor, New Jersey Rep. Mikie Sherrill and former Rep. Abigail Spanberger of Virginia, have focused largely on the economy, public safety and health care, distancing themselves from some of the Democratic Party's far-left policies.\n\nA growing collection of Democratic leaders believe the moderate approach holds the key to the party's revival after the GOP won the White House and both congressional chambers last year. Tuesday could be a key indicator of whether they're right.\n\nBoth Sherrill and Spanberger have downplayed their support for progressive priorities, including LGBTQ rights and resistance against Trump's attack on American institutions. Spanberger rarely even mentions Trump's name on the campaign trail.\n\nBoth also have resumes that might appeal to the middle.\n\nSherrill spent a decade as an active-duty helicopter pilot for the Navy before entering Congress, while Spanberger is a former CIA case officer who spent years abroad working undercover. They have played up their public safety backgrounds as a direct response to the GOP's attack that Democrats are soft on crime.\n\nAbove all, the Democrats have focused on rising costs such as groceries, energy and health care, which Trump has struggled to control.\n\nThat approach is far different from New York City's mayoral race, where progressives are energized by Zohran Mamdani, a 34-year-old Muslim state legislator who identifies as a democratic socialist and backs radical changes to address economic inequality.\n\nHis bold agenda and inspirational approach have attracted thousands of volunteers in New York and brought the likes of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to campaign on his behalf. It has also spooked some business leaders and voices in the Jewish community, who otherwise support Democrats but oppose some of Mamdani's past statements about personal wealth accumulation and Israel.\n\nMamdani has been locked in a caustic race against former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who is running as an independent after losing the Democratic primary to Mamdani. Republican Curtis Sliwa is looking for a huge upset.\n\nAnd while many progressives are thrilled, some Republicans in Washington are also quietly rooting for a Mamdani victory. Republican campaign committees have already launched attack ads against more than a dozen vulnerable House Democrats in New York and New Jersey linking them to Mamdani and his far-left politics.\n\nTrump endorsed Cuomo, posting online Monday evening: \"Whether you personally like Andrew Cuomo or not, you really have no choice. You must vote for him, and hope he does a fantastic job. He is capable of it, Mamdani is not!\"\n\nThat's after Trump derided Mamdani nearly every day. GOP operatives are also giddy about the opportunity to use him to attack many more Democrats closer to next year's midterm elections -- just as they have done with progressive Democrats such as House \"squad\" members like Ocasio-Cortez and Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar.\n\nElection Day comes in the midst of a federal government shutdown that has already spanned more than a month. Both parties in Congress blame each other, and there is no end in sight.\n\nWill it matter?\n\nVirginia is home to more than 134,000 federal workers, many of whom have been furloughed or are being forced to work without pay. New Jersey has nearly 21,000 federal employees, according to the nonprofit Partnership for Public Service, out of a total of more than 2 million such government employees nationwide.\n\nEither number is more than enough to swing a close election.\n\nAt the same time, millions of people may be losing critical food assistance from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, offering voters another urgent reason to express their displeasure.\n\nPolling shows that Republicans, who control Congress and the White House, are getting slightly more blame than Democrats -- though there is plenty of frustration aimed at both sides.\n\nTrump has taken the extraordinary step of calling on the Senate to scrap filibuster rules requiring a 60-vote minimum on major legislation to try and force the government to reopen -- even though his party's leadership considers that a nonstarter.\n\nWhile Trump lost Virginia and New Jersey last fall, there were significant shifts to the right in both states. In New Jersey, Trump's 16-point loss in 2020 shrunk to less than 6 points in 2024.\n\nThose shifts were fueled by Trump's increasing popularity among traditional Democratic loyalists: labor union members, Black men, Hispanic voters and younger people. Democrats are particularly vulnerable in New Jersey, which has among the largest percentage of labor union households in the nation.\n\nIf those pro-Trump trends continue this week, Democrats could be in trouble.\n\nBut Trump is not on the ballot, of course. And the Trump coalition -- especially lower-propensity voters -- has not typically shown up in the same numbers in non-presidential years.\n\nDemocrats are cautiously optimistic given that Trump did not campaign aggressively in either state, a move driven both by the president's weak standing and his allies' concerns about the Republican candidates' viability -- especially in Virginia.\n\nAt the same time, the biggest star in Democratic politics, former President Barack Obama, rallied voters in New Jersey and Virginia over the weekend.\n\nPennsylvania voters will decide whether three state Supreme Court justices supported by Democrats will serve another term.\n\nThe outcome may shape the seven-member high court in the nation's most populous swing state, and may have implications for key cases involving redistricting and balloting for midterm elections and the 2028 presidential race.\n\nThe incumbents aren't listed by party affiliation. The ballot merely asks voters to cast a yes-or-no vote. But spending on the race is likely to exceed $15 million, indicating how important it is to Democrats and Republicans in Pennsylvania and beyond.\n\nIn California, Gov. Gavin Newsom, frequently mentioned as a 2028 presidential hopeful, is leading a charge to redraw congressional maps to give Democrats as many as five more House seats in upcoming elections.\n\nThe push is the centerpiece of a Democratic effort to counter new Republican maps in Texas and elsewhere that were drawn to boost the GOP's chances in next year's fight to control Congress. In order for the new maps to count in 2026, however, voters will first have to approve a yes-or-no ballot question known as Proposition 50.",

        "title": "California voters take up Democrats' push for new congressional maps that could shape House control",
        "description": "The outcome will reverberate into next year's midterm elections and beyond.\n\nBy JONATHAN J. COOPER, MICHAEL R. BLOOD and TR\u00c2N NGUY\u1ec4N, Associated Press\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) -- The national battle to control the U.S. House shifts to California on Tuesday as voters consider a Democratic proposal that could erase as many as five Republican districts and blunt President Donald Trump's moves to safeguard his party's lock on Washington power.\n\nThe outcome will reverberate into next year's midterm elections and beyond, with Democrats hoping a victory will set the stage for the party to regain control of the House in 2026. A shift in the majority would imperil Trump's agenda for the remainder of his term at a time of deep partisan divisions over immigration, health care and the future direction of the nation.\n\n\"God help us if we lose in California,\" Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom says.\n\nDemocrats need to gain just three seats in the 2026 elections to take control of the House.\n\nHeavily Democratic California and its 52 congressional districts represent by far the Democrats' best opportunity in an unprecedented state-by-state redistricting battle, which started when Texas Republicans heeded Trump's demand that they redraw their boundaries to help the GOP retain its House majority. Democrats hold 43 of the state's seats and hope to boost that to 48.\n\nTrump is fighting not just the Democrats but history. Midterm elections typically punish the party in the White House, but four GOP-led states so far have adopted new district maps to pack more Republican voters into key districts.\n\nCalifornia's Proposition 50 asks voters to suspend House maps drawn by an independent commission and replace them with rejiggered districts adopted by the Democratic-controlled Legislature. Those new districts would be in place for the 2026, 2028 and 2030 elections.\n\nThe recast districts aim to dilute Republican voters' power, in one case by uniting rural, conservative-leaning parts of far northern California with Marin County, a famously liberal coastal stronghold across the Golden Gate Bridge from San Francisco.\n\nThe measure has been spearheaded by Newsom, who has thrown the weight of his political operation behind it in a major test of his mettle ahead of a potential 2028 presidential campaign. Former President Barack Obama has urged voters to pass it as well.\n\nNewsom has sought to nationalize the campaign, depicting the proposal as a counterweight to all things Trump.\n\n\"Republicans want to steal enough seats in Congress to rig the next election and wield unchecked power for two more years,\" Obama says in one ad. \"You can stop Republicans in their tracks.\"\n\nCritics say two wrongs don't make a right. They urge Californians to reject what they call a Democratic power grab, even if they have misgivings about Trump's moves in Republican-led states.\n\nAmong the most prominent critics is Arnold Schwarzenegger, the movie star and former Republican governor who pushed for the creation of the independent commission, which voters approved in 2008 and 2010. It makes no sense to fight Trump by becoming him, Schwarzenegger said in September, arguing that the proposal would \"take the power away from the people.\"\n\nAfter an early burst of TV advertising, opponents of the plan have struggled to raise cash in a state with some of the nation's most expensive media markets. Data compiled by advertising tracker AdImpact last week showed Democrats and other supporters with over $5 million in ad buys booked on broadcast TV, cable and radio. But opponents had virtually no time reserved, though the data didn't include some popular streaming services like Hulu and YouTube or mail advertising.\n\nTotal spending on broadcast and cable ads topped $100 million, with more than two-thirds of it coming from supporters. Newsom told people to stop donating in the race's final weeks.\n\nTrump, who overwhelmingly lost California in his three presidential campaigns, largely stayed out of the fray. A week before the election, he urged voters in a social media post not to vote early or by mail -- messaging that conflicts with that of top Republicans in the state who urged people to get their ballots in as soon as possible.\n\nDemocrats hope to pick up as many as five seats in California if voters approve the new boundaries, offsetting the five that Republicans hope to pick up through their new Texas maps. Republicans also expect to gain one seat each from new maps in Missouri and North Carolina, and potentially two more in Ohio.\n\nCongressional district boundaries are typically redrawn every 10 years to reflect population shifts documented in the census. Mid-decade redistricting is unusual, absent a court order finding fault with the maps in place.\n\nFive other GOP-led states are also considering new maps: Kansas, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana and Nebraska.\n\nOn the Democratic side, Illinois, Maryland, New York and Virginia have proposals to redraw maps, but major hurdles remain.\n\nA court has ordered new boundaries be drawn in Utah, where all four House districts are represented by Republicans, but it remains to be seen if the state will approve a map that makes any of them winnable for Democrats.",

        "title": "The First Big Elections of the New Trump Era Are Today. Here's What to Look For.",
        "description": "Voters on Tuesday will deliver an early judgment on President Trump's administration in the first set of coast-to-coast elections since he began his turbulent second term.\n\nContests for mayor of New York, governor of New Jersey and Virginia, and a redistricting ballot measure in California have revolved to varying degrees around how the Democratic Party should rebuild itself and respond to Mr. Trump's power play in Washington.\n\nThe elections are predominantly in Democratic areas and battleground states, where the party's candidates have sought to harness anger about Mr. Trump while deflecting discontent about the state of the Democratic brand.\n\nWith the 2026 midterm elections set to decide control of Congress for the final two years of Mr. Trump's term, both parties will look to Tuesday's results to guide how they campaign for the next year.\n\nHere are five questions about the elections -- though given the pace of vote counting in some areas, not all of the answers may be available by the end of the night.\n\nCan Mamdani get to 50 percent?\n\nZohran Mamdani, the 34-year-old State Assembly member who in eight months has transformed from a political unknown to one of the nation's tentpole figures in Democratic politics, does not need a majority of the vote to become New York City's mayor.\n\nBut it sure would help his argument that the city is hungry for his progressive politics.\n\nThe latest polling shows Mr. Mamdani with support from just under half of the city's likely voters while holding a healthy lead over Andrew M. Cuomo, the former governor who is running as an independent after losing the Democratic primary, and Curtis Sliwa, the longtime civic gadfly running as the Republican nominee.\n\nMr. Trump on Monday endorsed Mr. Cuomo, a nod that may not help the former governor, given that New York City last year backed Vice President Kamala Harris over Mr. Trump by 36 percentage points.\n\nA decisive, majority victory by Mr. Mamdani would provide an electoral mandate for the progressive vision he and his democratic socialist compatriots have supported for years. They have called for tax increases for the wealthy to subsidize transportation and social programs aimed at lowering the cost of living.\n\nWinning big would also help Mr. Mamdani and progressive Democrats fight the argument within their party that his brand is toxic for the sort of voters who are expected to decide congressional majorities in the midterms.\n\nNew York City may have little in common with the suburban districts that will make up the political battlefields in 2026, and Republicans have already begun to try to make Mr. Mamdani the face of the Democratic Party and yoke him to candidates elsewhere. His margin on Tuesday may determine how much the party outside New York embraces him going forward.\n\nWill New Jersey and Virginia provide a rebuke to Trump?\n\nEvery four years, a year after the presidential election, voters in New Jersey and Virginia offer a test of how the newly elected president is doing.\n\nRecent history says they tend to not like what they see.\n\nOnly once since the Nixon administration have Virginians picked a governor of the same party as the president. And New Jersey, a reliably Democratic state in presidential races since 1992, elected Chris Christie a year into Barack Obama's first term and nearly ousted Gov. Philip D. Murphy four years ago.\n\nNow with Mr. Trump in the White House again, Representative Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey and former Representative Abigail Spanberger of Virginia are trying to ride Democratic anger about Mr. Trump to become their states' governors.\n\nIt is a playbook Democrats have used to great effect since Mr. Trump first took office in 2017 and again in the 2018 midterms. This year, predicted former Gov. Terry McAuliffe of Virginia, \"will be like 2017 on steroids.\"\n\nIs California the first major Democratic redistricting domino to fall, or the last?\n\nMr. Trump's summer demand that Texas redraw its congressional map to shift five districts from Democrats to Republicans handed Gov. Gavin Newsom of California a political gift.\n\nClearly itching to run for president in 2028, Mr. Newsom suddenly had a big issue to push in 2025: engineering California's own congressional redraw, aimed at flipping five Republican seats to Democrats while positioning his state -- and himself -- as the leader of his party's off-year resistance.\n\nPolls show that the ballot measure authorizing new maps is likely to pass, and Mr. Newsom has taken victory laps in the form of telling liberal donors to stop giving money. The question may be how many more blue states will answer the governor's August call that \"blue states need to stand up.\"\n\nLast week, Virginia Democrats voted to take the first step toward a spring redraw that could flip a few of the state's five Republican seats. There are moves afoot in Illinois, Maryland and New York, though the degrees of difficulty vary by state.\n\nThe margin in California's ballot measure -- which owing to the state's slow counting of votes may not be known for days or weeks -- will serve as a test of how much blue-state voters want to engage in the extraordinary mid-decade redistricting battle Mr. Trump instigated.\n\nThe answer will certainly be heard by Democratic legislators in states still weighing their options.\n\nWill the Trump administration intervene at polling sites?\n\nDemocrats like Gov. JB Pritzker of Illinois have warned that Mr. Trump could send troops to polling places to intimidate voters. Gov. Gavin Newsom of California floated the idea, disputed by ICE, that immigration agents might show up at precincts on Election Day. The Justice Department has said it will send election monitors to California and New Jersey.\n\nAs much as Tuesday's elections are a dry run for the midterms politically, they may also serve as a test for how a federal government bent on serving the president's political desires might work to tilt elections in his favor.\n\nOf course, recent voting patterns have shown that Democrats are far more likely than Republicans to vote early or by mail, so a broad effort by the federal government to scare Election Day voters could backfire -- though it seems unlikely to take place in deeply Republican areas.\n\nWho will control the Pennsylvania Supreme Court for 2028?\n\nThree justices who ran with the backing of Democrats are up for retention in Pennsylvania in an election that will determine the balance of the State Supreme Court through 2028 in the biggest swing state in the nation.\n\nThe state court has a 5-to-2 Democratic lean, and it has decided some major election-related cases in recent years. In 2022, it upheld the state's mail-in voting law. In 2020, the Democratic justices ruled that ballot drop boxes were permitted in the state. And in 2018, the court ruled that the state's congressional district map was a partisan gerrymander that \"clearly, plainly and palpably\" violated the state's Constitution.\n\nBut the election in Pennsylvania, known as a retention election, is a bit quirky.\n\nThe justices -- Kevin M. Dougherty, Christine Donohue and David N. Wecht -- campaign on their own, but they're confined to discussing only their judicial philosophy, and they cannot make political pledges or discuss cases before the court. And there are no opponents. Instead, voters in Pennsylvania simply vote \"yes\" or \"no\" on whether to retain the justices for 10 more years.\n\nIf the justices are not retained, Gov. Josh Shapiro, a Democrat, would nominate their replacement, but they would have to be approved by the State Senate, which Republicans control.\n\nThis could mean that the court remains deadlocked at 2-to-2 until 2027, when the three seats would again come up for election. That scenario would leave Democrats without a critical check on election litigation during the midterms, when Pennsylvania will host a key governor's race and several close congressional elections.\n\nWill the progressives prevail in other races for mayor?\n\nAlong with New York, a host of major cities will elect mayors on Tuesday. Incumbents are expected to coast to re-election in Atlanta, Boston, Cincinnati, Pittsburgh and Charlotte, N.C.\n\nNew mayors will be elected in Detroit, Buffalo and Jersey City, N.J., where former Gov. Jim McGreevey is vying to make a Cuomo-like return to public office.\n\nThe most interesting mayoral contests are in Minneapolis and Seattle, where mainstream Democratic incumbents are trying to fend off challenges from left-wing rivals in elections that will serve as a gauge for the mind-set of urban liberal voters outside New York.\n\nMinneapolis Democrats spurned two-term incumbent Mayor Jacob Frey in July, endorsing a democratic socialist, State Senator Omar Fateh. A month later, the party revoked its endorsement, citing \"substantial failures\" during its convention.\n\nIn Seattle, Mayor Bruce Harrell faces a challenge from Katie Wilson, a left-wing community organizer who placed first in the August primary.\n\nMr. Harrell is trying to become the first Seattle mayor to win re-election since 2005 while Ms. Wilson is vying to harness the progressive energy and anti-establishment anger coursing through the Democratic Party.\n\nAnd in Miami, 13 mayoral candidates, including former mayors and members of local political dynasties, are vying to make to make a Dec. 9 runoff, provided none of them win outright by receiving more than 50 percent of Tuesday's vote.",

        "description": "Richard Ramos is a web producer for CBS Sacramento who was born and raised in Sacramento. He graduated with a BA in Journalism from CSUS.\n\nIt's the final push for California's Proposition 50, a ballot measure backed by Gov. Gavin Newsom and other legislative Democrats that aims to redraw the state's congressional districts.\n\nOn Monday, Gov. Newsom spoke at a rally in San Francisco on the eve of Election Day, rallying supporters.\n\n\"We're going to get out there and win,\" Newsom said, \"and send a powerful message not only to the people of the state of California, but the people all over the United States of America.\"\n\nThe No on 50 campaign is seeking a late surge of support. A recent poll from CBS News shows that approximately 62% of likely voters will vote yes on Proposition 50.\n\nChristian Forte is chair of the Sacramento County Republican Party.\n\n\"You take everything with a grain of salt,\" Forte said. \"Sure, you feel like, 'Oh my God, we're losing,' but you just keep fighting. Donald Trump was supposed to lose in '16.\"\n\nThe two Proposition 50 campaigns have bombarded viewers with political ads. The \"no\" side focused on independent redistricting, while the \"yes\" side focused on President Trump.\n\nRepublican strategist Mike Madrid, who has campaigned against Mr. Trump, said this election has become a referendum on Trump.\n\n\"I don't think that 99% of the voters who voted and have shown up or will show up have looked at the maps,\" Madrid said. \"In many ways, a lot of voters have been waiting since November of 2024 to vote with their middle fingers against Donald Trump, and Prop. 50 is the best way to do it.\"\n\nNewsom and supporters of Proposition 50 said the measure is a counter to congressional redistricting in states like Texas that favors Republicans in next year's midterms. Proposition 50, if approved by voters, would mean that California adopts new legislatively drawn congressional maps that make five GOP-held U.S. House seats in the state more favorable for Democrats in next year's midterm elections.\n\nThe race has quickly become one of the most expensive ballot measures in state history, with more than $253 million raised, as of November 3, across both sides and supporters out-raising opponents by a 2-to-1 margin, according to the California Secretary of State website. The race has also cemented Newsom's status as the leading voice of opposition to Mr. Trump.\n\nAbout a quarter of registered voters have already cast their ballots in early voting as of Monday. That matches early voting totals for the last Governor's race in 2022.",

        "description": "Don't miss the full story from our staff writers, whose reportage is the basis of this article.\n\nVoters in Virginia, New Jersey, and other states are heading to the polls Tuesday in high-stakes elections that could provide early indicators of the national political climate ten months into President Trump's second term and one year before the 2026 midterms. While most races are in Democrat-friendly territory, the outcomes could signal warning signs for both parties.\n\nIn Virginia's governor's race, former Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger holds a steady polling lead over Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears. Spanberger has positioned herself as a pragmatic problem-solver focused on energy, housing, and health care costs, while tying Earle-Sears to Trump's federal agency cuts that have affected Virginia's 140,000 government workers. Earle-Sears has countered by attacking Spanberger on transgender issues and pressuring her over Democratic attorney general candidate Jay Jones, who reportedly sent 2022 text messages about killing the then-Republican House speaker. The revelations have boosted Republican attorney general Jay Miyares's re-election chances. All 100 Virginia House of Delegates seats are contested, with Democrats hoping to expand their majority to enable congressional redistricting.\n\nNew Jersey's governor's race offers Republicans their most attractive pickup opportunity. Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill, a former Navy helicopter pilot, faces Republican businessman Jack Ciattarelli in his third gubernatorial run. Sherrill has branded Ciattarelli as the \"Trump of Trenton\" and vowed to resist White House policies on tariffs and abortion, though critics say she appears too choreographed. Ciattarelli argues New Jersey needs a governor who can work with Washington and has pledged to roll back sanctuary policies and lower property taxes. Recent polls show Sherrill leading by just 3 points as Ciattarelli gains momentum.\n\nIn New York's mayoral race, Democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani shocked the political world by defeating former Gov. Andrew Cuomo by nearly 13 points in the Democratic primary. The 34-year-old state assemblyman is running on an ambitious platform including free child care, city-run grocery stores, and a four-year rent freeze, funded by higher taxes on the wealthy. Cuomo is now running as an independent, while Trump called Mamdani a \"communist\" and threatened to withhold federal funds if he wins. Mamdani has divided Democrats, earning endorsements from Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez but not Chuck Schumer.\n\nCalifornia voters will decide on Proposition 50, Gov. Gavin Newsom's referendum to replace independent redistricting with Democratic-friendly congressional maps, responding to Republican gerrymandering in Texas.",

        "title": "Voter ID measure violates California law, appeals court says",
        "description": "SANTA ANA, Calif. -- A California appeals court ruled Monday that a Huntington Beach measure requiring voter identification at the polls violates state law.\n\nThe Fourth District Court of Appeal in Santa Ana determined that the measure passed by voters in the seaside city of 200,000 people should be struck down because it conflicts with state election law, said Lee Fink, a lawyer for Huntington Beach resident Mark Bixby, who challenged the city's measure. California Attorney General Rob Bonta also sued over the Huntington Beach law contending it would disenfranchise voters.\n\n\"Voting is the fundamental right from which all other rights flow, and no matter where threats to that right come from -- whether from Washington D.C. or from within California -- we will continue holding the line,\" Bonta said in a statement. \"California's elections are already fair, safe, and secure.\"\n\nCorbin Carson, a Huntington Beach spokesperson, said the city is reviewing the appeals court's ruling.\n\nResidents of Huntington Beach voted last year to let local officials require voter identification at the polls starting in 2026. The measure also allows the city to increase in-person voting sites and monitor ballot drop boxes in local elections.\n\nBonta filed a lawsuit saying the measure conflicts with state law and could make it harder for poor, non-white, young, elderly and disabled voters to cast ballots. California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, then signed into state law a measure barring local governments from establishing and enforcing laws that require residents provide identification to vote in elections.\n\nHuntington Beach, which is known as \"Surf City USA\" for its scenic shoreline dotted with surfers, has a history of sparring with state officials over the measures it can take under its city charter on issues ranging from immigration to housing. The GOP is dominant in Huntington Beach with nearly 57,000 registered voters versus 41,000 Democrats, county data shows.",

        "title": "ICE Altercation With Protester in Colorado Prompts a Police Chief to Push Back",
        "description": "Brice Current, the police chief in the Durango, Colo., knew there was a problem the moment he saw the video of an immigration agent putting a protester into what the chief saw as a chokehold and throwing her down an embankment.\n\nImmigration agents had arrested a Colombian man and his two children on their way to school last week, provoking a furious response from this liberal college town of 20,000 in the mountains of southwest Colorado. Dozens of residents -- many with their arms linked -- descended on the small Immigration and Customs Enforcement building where the family was being held, set up camp outside the razor-wire gates and tried to block authorities from removing the family from Durango.\n\nWhat set the protest apart from similar clashes between residents and immigration agents in Chicago, Los Angeles and other cities was Chief Current's determination that the masked federal agent involved in the scuffle had crossed a line and his request for an investigation. He said he even considered filing criminal charges himself against the agent.\n\n\"It appeared to be an out-of-policy and possibly illegal use of force,\" he said in an interview at police headquarters.\n\nThe scene from Durango, captured by fellow protesters and put on social media, was violent and jarring, but no more so than many others across the country. Several protesters, including elected officials and a Democratic congressional candidate, have been arrested or charged with federal crimes at immigration detention centers. American citizens have been whisked into unmarked vehicles and charged with resisting arrest or attacking officers, though the people arrested have maintained they did no such thing.\n\nProtesters, journalists and clergy have sued over federal agents' use of tear gas and crowd-control munitions against protesters. A U.S. citizen who was violently thrown to ground in Chicago has vowed to \"pursue all legal avenues\" against the agents involved.\n\nBut so far, no local prosecutors are known to have filed criminal charges against immigration agents.\n\nThat might change. At Chief Current's request, the Colorado Bureau of Investigation has opened an investigation into the incident in Durango, putting Democratic-led Colorado on a potential collision course with the Trump administration, which has threatened to prosecute any local officials if they charge federal agents carrying out President Trump's immigration crackdown.\n\nIn an interview, Chief Current said that rather than bring charges himself, he decided that state investigators were better equipped to handle thorny legal questions of whether the agent had broken any laws, or could even be prosecuted in Colorado.\n\nFederal agents have broad legal protections, and the Trump administration has argued that the Constitution puts federal officers out of reach of state laws when they are carrying out their duties.\n\nStill, the Colorado Bureau of Investigation said it was investigating any \"state criminal law violations during the incident,\" and would send its findings to local prosecutors to make a decision about whether to file any charges.\n\nThe Colorado Bureau of Investigation declined to comment further. The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nSean Murray, the district attorney in Durango, said that before he made a decision about filing any charges, he would have to weigh whether laws were violated and whether the agent had immunity. If he did file a charge, he said he expected it would prompt reams of litigation.\n\nLast month, when Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the former House Speaker, said local police could arrest federal agents who broke California law Ms. Pelosi's assertion provoked a furious response from the Justice Department. Todd Blanche, the deputy attorney general, called such an arresting \"illegal and futile,\" and fired off a letter to Gov. Gavin Newsom of California and Ms. Pelosi warning them to \"stand down or face prosecution.\"\n\nIn Durango, Franci Stagi, 57, the protester who was involved in the altercation with the masked immigration agent, said she supported Colorado's decision to investigate. The Times obtained videos which showed how the events unfolded from people on the ground, seen from multiple different angles.\n\n\"You can't go around and just do that indiscriminately,\" Ms. Stagi said. \"You can't pull somebody by their head.\"\n\nMs. Stagi, a retiree who lives a mountain life of hiking, skiing and van camping, had driven to the ICE building after she saw social-media posts last Monday about the arrest of the Colombian father, Fernando Jaramillo-Solano, 45, and his 12-year-old daughter, Jana, and 15-year-old son, Kewin.\n\nMr. Solano, his wife and their children landed in Durango about 18 months ago after fleeing political violence in Colombia, and applied for asylum, according to Enrique Orozco-Perez, a co-director of Compa\u00f1eros, an immigrant resource center in Durango that worked with the family.\n\n\"They felt a sense of security because their case is active,\" Mr. Orozco-Perez said.\n\nMr. Solano worked three jobs, and his wife did cleaning work, made empanadas and cared for the children in a rundown trailer park outside Durango. The family had no run-ins with local law enforcement, officials said.\n\nMr. Solano was driving Jana and Kewin to school that Monday when immigration agents stopped him at about 7:30 a.m. and pulled him from his car. He shouted to passers-by that his children were in the car.\n\nHis arrest turned out to be a case of mistaken identity, an ICE official in Denver later said during a court hearing reported earlier by The Denver Post. In Durango, Chief Current said he pressed ICE officials to at least release the two children from custody to reunite with their mother, but he was rebuffed.\n\nMs. Stagi said she does not attend many protests, but as a mother, she was outraged that two children could be arrested and held for more than 24 hours inside the ICE office that operates in a former carwash on the edge of Durango.\n\n\"They're little kids,\" she said.\n\nMs. Stagi's confrontation with the immigration agent -- who has not been identified by local law enforcement -- occurred at about 6 a.m. Tuesday, according to videos from the protest.\n\nThe masked immigration agent was walking through a crowd of protesters when Ms. Stagi approached him, phone in hand, and asked, \"You won't even show your face?\"\n\nThe agent hit her hand, knocking away the phone and possibly grabbed it. Ms. Stagi ran after him, saying, \"Dude, you can't take my phone.\"\n\nMs. Stagi said she reflexively touched the agent's back to get his attention. The instant she did, she said, he wheeled around, grabbed Ms. Stagi by the hair, put her into a chokehold, dragged her through the street and threw her down a grassy embankment.\n\nMs. Stagi said she realized in that moment she should not have touched the agent -- an action that experts in police use of force said could be used to argue that the agent was acting reasonably.\n\n\"It was a knee-jerk reaction,\" Ms. Stagi said. \"I'm 5-2. I'm not assaulting him. I was just looking for my phone. He crossed the line.\"\n\nThe protest again spiraled out of control later that day when more than a dozen federal officers -- some in military-style gear -- arrived to clear away protesters so agents could remove Mr. Solano and his children.\n\nVideos show officers pulling the protesters away from the fence surrounding the ICE building and cutting through chains that protesters had put around the front gates. Officers pepper-sprayed protesters and fired crowd-control munitions at them. Some protesters appeared to push officers and throw water bottles.\n\nChief Current said the F.B.I. had opened an investigation into the clashes, raising the possibility that some demonstrators could face federal charges. An F.B.I. spokeswoman in Denver declined to comment, citing the government shutdown.\n\nThe protest broke up not long after the family was driven away, but a painful rift remains in Durango.\n\nChief Current blamed \"bad decisions\" by ICE for creating the unrest, but he also said that some demonstrators had turned the protest into a riot. Activists in Durango accused the police and city officials of not protecting the city's residents, a charge leveled at other police departments dealing with the president's immigration crackdown.\n\n\"They watched this community get brutally beaten,\" Jay Conlon, a demonstrator, said. \"They stood by and watched.\"\n\nMr. Solano and his children were taken to a family detention center in Texas. They remained there on Monday, as politicians and activists in Colorado continued to call for their release.",

        "title": "Off-year elections Tuesday to tap voter mood from coast to coast",
        "description": "After months of mudslinging, feisty debates, and relentless door-knocking, voters in Virginia and New Jersey head to the polls Tuesday to decide high-stakes races that could offer early clues about the national political mood ten months into President Trump's second term and one year out from the 2026 midterms.\n\nIn New York, voters are weighing whether state Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani's socialist vision fits the needs of the country's biggest -- and priciest -- city or whether they would rather turn back the clock with former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who's attempting a political comeback after resigning in 2021 because of sexual harassment allegations, which he denies.\n\nOut west, Gov. Gavin Newsom of California could get a boost in his march toward a likely bid for the 2028 Democratic presidential nomination. If voters approve the new congressional maps he's championing, it'll be a win for Mr. Newsom and Democrats against redistricting in Republican-led states. And in Pennsylvania, voters will decide whether to retain three Democratic justices on the state Supreme Court in contests that have drawn national attention.\n\nMr. Trump's influence looms over it all.\n\nWhile Tuesday's contests are unfolding on mostly Democrat-friendly turf, the contests could be a warning sign for both parties headed into the 2026 midterm elections.\n\n\"This is one of those things where you have to read between the lines as to the strength of the Democratic or Republican sentiment because all the elections are playing out in states where voters went for Kamala Harris,\" said John Couvillon, a pollster and political strategist. \"The question then becomes, are they near Democratic victories with Republican wins, or are they wipeouts?\"\n\nVirginia\n\nFormer Rep. Abigail Spanberger, a Democrat, has held a steady lead in the polls over Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears in the governor's race.\n\nThe winner will replace Republican Glenn Youngkin, who is barred from serving consecutive terms under Virginia's Constitution.\n\nMs. Spanberger has run as a pragmatic problem-solver, vowing to address the rising costs of energy, housing, and health care.\n\nMs. Spanberger has kept Mr. Trump front and center in the race, tying Ms. Earle-Sears to his policies, including the DOGE cuts to federal agencies and the firing of federal employees that have hit Virginia, home to over 140,000 government workers.\n\nMs. Earle-Sears has put Ms. Spanberger on her heels over thorny transgender issues, criticizing the Democrat for supporting biological men in women's sports and locker rooms.\n\nMs. Earle-Sears also has pressured Ms. Spanberger to demand Jay Jones drop out of the race for attorney general after reports surfaced that he mused in 2022 text messages about killing the then-Republican speaker of the Virginia House of Delegates.\n\nThe bombshell revelations have boosted Republican Jay Miyares's re-election bid and the GOP's hopes, as they look to avoid a statewide Democratic sweep and emerge with some bragging rights.\n\nIn the lieutenant governor's race, state Sen. Ghazala Hashmi has a slight polling lead over John Reid.\n\nPolitical insiders are also keeping close tabs on the Virginia House of Delegates.\n\nAll 100 seats are up for grabs. Democrats are hoping to expand their slim majority as they consider redrawing the state's congressional lines to make gains next fall.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nOf all the contests on the map Tuesday, the New Jersey governor's race might be the most attractive -- and attainable -- prize for Republicans. They're hoping to build on the gains Mr. Trump made in the traditionally deep-blue state during the 2024 election.\n\nOn the ballot: Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill, a former Navy helicopter pilot, and Republican Jack Ciattarelli, a businessman and former state lawmaker.\n\nBoth are pitching plans to tackle rising energy and housing costs -- but their visions, and their tone, couldn't be more different.\n\nMs. Sherrill has positioned herself as a center-left moderate.\n\nShe has been criticized for coming across as too choreographed and too canned on the stump, raising questions about whether the party's base, including minority communities, will turn out.\n\nMs. Sherrill has tried to harness the anti-Trump sentiment in the state by branding Mr. Ciattarelli as a Trump loyalist. She's called him the \"Trump of Trenton\" and warned that he's too weak to push back against what she describes as chaos and corruption from the White House. She's also promised to stand firm against Trump-era policies on tariffs and abortion.\n\nMr. Ciattarelli argues that New Jersey needs a governor who can work with the White House -- not against it.\n\nHe's pledged to roll back Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy's \"sanctuary\" policies and give local police more authority to cooperate with federal immigration agents, especially in targeting violent undocumented immigrants.\n\nHe also has vowed to lower property taxes and change the state's formula for funding K-12 schools.\n\nMr. Ciattarelli, who is running for governor for a third time, is carrying momentum into Election Day. The latest RealClearPolitics average of polls shows Ms. Sherill has a 3-point lead, but Mr. Ciattarelli has been steadying, gaining ground on her.\n\nAll 80 seats in the New Jersey General Assembly are also on the ballot.\n\nNew York City\n\nDemocratic socialist Zohran Mamdani has charted a far different and bolder course from Ms. Spanberger and Ms. Sherill, running a charismatic campaign centered on lifting the working class in a city that is home to more billionaires than anywhere else in the world.\n\nMr. Mandani's wishlist ranges from free child care to city-run grocery stores and a four-year rent freeze on roughly a million apartments. To pay for his vision, he unabashedly supports higher taxes on the wealthiest 1% and large corporations.\n\nThe little-known state assemblyman with a thin employment and legislative record shocked the political world by defeating Mr. Cuomo by almost 13 points in the Democratic primary.\n\nMr. Cuomo, in turn, announced he was running as an independent, and has been playing catch-up ever since. Republican Curtis Sliwa is also running in a long-shot bid.\n\nThe 67-year-old Mr. Cuomo has leaned into his executive experience, arguing that the 34-year-old Mr. Mamdani, born to Indian parents in Uganda, is not equipped to lead the city. He warns that Mr. Mamdani's socialist vision would harm the city.\n\nMr. Mamdani's rise has seized the attention of the political world. Mr. Trump, during an appearance on CBS's \"60 Minutes\" on Sunday, derided him as a \"communist, not a socialist.\"\n\n\"He is far worse than socialist,\" Mr. Trump said, warning it would be hard for him to release federal funds to New York if Mr. Mamdani is elected.\n\nMr. Mamdani has also divided the Democratic Party.\n\nHe notched early endorsements from fellow democratic socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders and \"Squad\" leader Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and, more recently, from Gov. Kathy Hochul and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries.\n\nYet key figures -- including Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer and other members of New York's congressional delegation -- have withheld their endorsements.\n\nOthers, including Mr. Jeffries, have pushed back against Mr. Trump and Republicans as they seek to cast Mr. Mamdani as the new leader of the Democratic Party.\n\nAsked over the weekend whether Mr. Mamdani embodies the party's future, Mr. Jeffries responded: \"No.\"\n\nProposition 50\n\nMr. Newsom is urging Democrats to fight fire with fire in California, arguing they must set aside traditional political norms to combat Mr. Trump.\n\nWith that as a backdrop, Mr. Newsom and Democrats are asking voters in California to pass a referendum that would replace the work of the state's independent redistricting commission with a more Democratic-friendly map.\n\nThe ballot question is Proposition 50 -- The Election Rigging Response Act.\n\nIt is a response to the Trump-inspired Republican push in Texas, where lawmakers broke with tradition earlier this year by adopting new congressional districts that could help the GOP net five seats and defend their slim House majority next fall.\n\n\"He is not screwing around,\" Mr. Newsom said of Mr. Trump on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\" \"He's changing the rules. He's rigging the game because he knows he'll lose if all things are equal. He did not expect California to fight fire with fire.\"\n\nSurveys show the referendum is likely to pass.",

        "title": "'Shockwaves': GOP pollster in awe as Republicans in for a 'bad day tomorrow'",
        "description": "An analyst Monday gave a stark warning ahead of the elections Tuesday, saying that voters are signaling they have had enough and are ready to say \"to hell with you all.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump's approval rating has hit a second-term low: dropping to 63% among Americans disapproving of him and 37% approving of him, according to a new CNN poll released Monday, just ahead of the off-year election day. Democrats are also showing an advantage when it comes to motivation ahead of the elections, with 67% of Democratic leaning voters saying they are highly motivated to vote vs. 46% of Republican leaning voters saying they are motivated to cast their ballots.\n\n\"Republicans are going to have a bad day tomorrow,\" Frank Luntz, pollster and communications strategist, told CNN anchors Boris Sanchez and Brianna Keilar.\n\nMany of the elections are local or statewide, he added. A key race on the West Coast has his attention.\n\n\"But the one that matters the most for the country is the vote in California, whether or not they're going to change the laws for redistricting,\" Luntz said. \"And that could mean as much as a five-seat Democratic gain, five-seat Republican loss if [Gov.] Gavin Newsom is successful in his ballot initiative. At this point, I think he will be. And that's going to send shockwaves across the country as people begin to look at what's going to happen a year from now. I do believe Democrats win the governorship in New Jersey and Virginia, a socialist is going to be elected mayor of New York [City]. But the one that I'm going to be watching most carefully is California.\"\n\nAs the government shutdown drags out into its second month, Americans are tired of it. And that could be reflected in the election outcome, he added.\n\n\"And this is the breaking point. When you don't pay our men and women in uniform and they have to go without their weekly paychecks. And you start to have people who cannot afford their food and fuel, then it starts to have an impact. And then people start to say, 'Why is this happening?'\" Luntz said.\n\n\"I believe that the shutdown is politically motivated,\" he added. \"I believe that if they wanted to, they could find common ground, but they choose not to. And that is hurting the Republican brand, the Republican reputation. Their numbers are down. As you point out in your own polling, with Donald Trump. But the numbers that have fallen the worst, to my surprise, are the Democrats. Everyone is being hurt by this. Everyone's credibility and respect and looking at the government and the public just looks at this and says, 'Why? Why can't you find some agreement? Why can't you give? Can you? Why can't you cooperate?' And that's going to be a very big question. Wednesday and Thursday when this election is over. It is hurting the Republicans, but it seems to be hurting the Democrats even more.\"\n\nAlthough it's difficult to predict what might happen next, redistricting is expected to impact the future.\n\n\"I'm going to be direct with you. The idea of changing the rules midway is abhorrent that these districts, the lines are drawn and they're supposed to sit for 10 years. And the fact that Republicans have changed the rules in Texas to change them in Ohio, they changed them in North Carolina. Democrats are trying to do the same. They filed lawsuits in New York. They're trying to win in California. It's going to undermine the faith and trust that we have in democracy. And I think it's one of the worst things that could be happening right now,\" Luntz said.\n\nIt's worrying to see the shifting attitudes towards government, especially amid a government shutdown, inflation, affordability and redistricting.\n\n\"And I look at this objectively as someone who measures public opinion and it is frightening how low these institutions, their credibility, how much they have fallen, and how the lack of belief and faith and trust in our democracy seems to be hitting an all-time low,\" Luntz said. \"And I am concerned, and I'm hoping that the people who engage in this process pay attention, because we're reaching a breaking point, and it's coming. And after that breaking point, who knows? Who can predict what happens when the public finally says, 'To hell with you all?' And that's where we're heading right now.\"",

        "description": "With the Republican Party in thrall to Donald Trump, assuming good faith on the other side is a luxury one can no longer afford.\n\nIt's possible that the most consequential election on Tuesday will not even elect a government official. You might have heard about California's Proposition 50, a statewide referendum that, if passed, will redraw the state's districts to give Democrats up to five more seats in the U.S. Congress.\n\nPolling indicates that Proposition 50 is expected to pass, and Republicans have all but thrown in the towel.\n\nBut, of course, this Democratic redistricting is not happening in a vacuum. It's a response.\n\nRight now, Congress is closely divided, and the upcoming midterms are a chance for Democrats to break the Republicans' unified grip on Washington. Earlier this year, Donald Trump fired the first shot when he pressed Texas Republicans to gerrymander their way to five more House seats in a rare, mid-decade redistricting shake-up.\n\nIt was an overt attempt to skew the midterms toward Republicans and prevent Trump from paying a political price for an agenda that on a single day last month inspired millions of Americans to take to the streets to protest.\n\nSince then, Republicans in Missouri and North Carolina have bowed to Trump's call and redrawn their maps. The president has also been pressuring more states, including Florida, Indiana, Kansas and Nebraska, to follow suit.\n\nIn response to Texas, California Gov. Gavin Newsom led the charge to create a ballot initiative that would fully counter those congressional losses in Texas.\n\n\"Donald Trump does not play fair,\" Newsom told reporters in August. \"You've seen that happen over and over again, and I'm just not going to sit back and be complicit. I don't think the people in the state of California are going to be complicit.\"\n\nNewsom has told his fellow Democrats it's time to \"meet fire with fire,\" calling it a \"break-the-glass moment for our democracy.\" Newsom added, \"Look, identifying a problem is one thing. You gotta do something about it. This is about action.\"\n\nIt's exactly what we've been talking about on \"Velshi\" for months: fighters versus folders. Assuming good faith on the other side is a luxury one can no longer afford with the Republican Party in thrall to Trump.\n\nIt's important to note that Newsom's strategy here is aggressive, but it is not corrupt in the same way that Trump's partisan redistricting efforts have been. Newsom is not asking Democrats to go into a backroom and redraw the maps. He's putting it to a vote.\n\nThis is a referendum that will be decided by the voters of California, not a state legislature submitting to the fearful impulse of a ruler. It's also not permanent.

        "title": "Matthew Lillard drops f-bombs on ICE at Los Angeles 'Scream' screening event while promoting ballot measure",
        "description": "Fox News senior correspondent Claudia Cowan reports on the latest incident of violence against I.C.E. agents on 'America Reports.'\n\nOriginal \"Scream\" actor Matthew Lillard condemned Immigration and Customs Enforcement during a fan screening of the 1990s horror film on Friday.\n\nMaking an appearance at a Los Angeles theater for a Halloween \"Scream\" event, Lillard took a moment to criticize the Trump administration's immigration enforcement and urged Angelenos to respond with love.\n\n\"F--- ICE. In this time, in this city, we need to lead with love. Do not forget that s--- in this moment. Not to be political, but to be political as s---,\" Lillard said.\n\nICE OFFICERS IN ILLINOIS TARGETED BY ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS WHO USED 'VEHICLES AS WEAPONS,' OFFICIALS SAY\n\nLillard, who is set to reprise his original \"Scream\" role in the upcoming \"Scream 7,\" also urged the crowd to vote for Proposition 50 in California's upcoming special election.\n\n\"Yes to 50. You have to vote. If you don't vote, we are going down. So, it's on us. And if you don't like that, I'm so not sorry.\"\n\nThe ballot measure would allow state lawmakers to temporarily redraw California's congressional map -- a move Democrats say could help them gain additional seats in Congress.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom, D-Calif., and other state Democrats have been promoting the effort, which could create five more Democratic-leaning congressional districts, to counter the passage of a new Texas redistricting map that aims to create up to five Republican-leaning House seats.\n\nICE CHIEF FIRES BACK AT CHICAGO-AREA MAYOR, CITES 'VIOLENT RIOTERS' AFTER WEEKS OF BROADVIEW UNREST\n\nOther celebrities have criticized ICE and President Donald Trump's immigration agenda in recent months, as the law enforcement agency has ramped up its efforts to deport illegal immigrants throughout the country.\n\nLatin music star Bad Bunny slammed ICE during an interview in September, saying one reason he skipped U.S. tour dates on his \"Debi Tirar Mas Fotos World Tour\" was so there was no risk his fans could be picked up by ICE agents.\n\nWhile performing at Portland's Moda Center in October, pop star Rene\u00e9 Rapp denounced the recent ICE raids there, saying, \"So let's just f------ make it abundantly f------ clear -- F--- ICE. F--- this administration. F--- Trump.\"\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE LATEST MEDIA AND CULTURE NEWS\n\nCountry artist Zach Bryan stirred controversy when a snippet of his song \"Bad News\" went viral in October for its anti-ICE lyrics.\n\nThe debate drew a response from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who publicly criticized the singer.\n\n\"I hope he understands how completely disrespectful that song is - not just to law enforcement, but to this country,\" she said in an interview with conservative commentator Benny Johnson.\n\nIn a statement to Fox News Digital, DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin called Lillard's statements, \"More boring garbage from Hollywood elites who are completely out of touch with the American people. Forget scary movies - the true horror is the violent criminal illegal aliens including pedophiles, murderers, and rapists who Joe Biden let into our country and are now preying on innocent Americans.\"\n\nShe added, \"The media, sanctuary politicians, and Hollywood elites must stop demonizing our brave law enforcement who are facing an 8,000% increase in death [threats] against them and having terrorists shoot at them, cars being used as weapons against them, online doxing of their families, and even bounties placed on their heads by criminal gangs. Lillard and his Hollywood friends should try thanking a law enforcement officer.\"",

        "title": "George Clooney says Kamala Harris replacing Joe Biden in 2024 election was a 'mistake'",
        "description": "After urging Joe Biden to exit the 2024 race in a New York Times op-ed, George Clooney says he feels Kamala Harris' presidential campaign was a \"mistake.\"\n\nGeorge Clooney is looking back on the \"mistake\" Democrats made in the 2024 election.\n\nDuring an interview on \"CBS Sunday Morning,\" the \"Jay Kelly\" star, who wrote a New York Times op-ed in 2024 calling on Democrats to replace Joe Biden as their presidential nominee, reflected on former Vice President Kamala Harris' election loss to President Donald Trump.\n\nClooney told CBS that he wishes Democrats would have had a competitive primary to decide on the best candidate to replace Biden, rather than quickly anointing Harris as his successor.\n\n\"I wanted there to be, as I wrote in the op-ed, a primary,\" Clooney said. \"'Let's battle test this quickly and get it up and going.' I think the mistake with it being Kamala is that she had to run against her own record. If the point of running is to say, 'I'm not that person,' it's hard to do. And so she was given a very tough task.\"\n\nClooney added, \"I think it was a mistake, quite honestly. But we are where we are.\"\n\nIn a New York Times essay published in July 2024, Clooney said he personally witnessed Biden's cognitive decline at a fundraiser and argued that Democrats were \"not going to win in November with this president.\" In the piece, the actor suggested that if Biden were to drop out of the 2024 race, \"a group of several strong Democrats\" could step forward \"and tell us why they're best qualified\" to be the nominee.\n\n\"Let's hear from Wes Moore and Kamala Harris and Gretchen Whitmer and Gavin Newsom and Andy Beshear and J.B. Pritzker and others,\" Clooney wrote. \"Let's agree that the candidates not attack one another but, in the short time we have, focus on what will make this country soar. Then we could go into the Democratic convention next month and figure it out.\"\n\nBiden ultimately dropped out of the presidential race later that month. But after Biden endorsed Harris as his successor, the Democratic Party quickly rallied around her as his replacement in the race. Just one day after Biden ended his campaign, Harris had secured the support of enough delegates needed to become the nominee.\n\nWhile speaking on \"CBS Sunday Morning,\" Clooney also responded after Hunter Biden slammed the actor for his New York Times op-ed in an expletive-laden rant. Appearing on \"Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan,\" the president's 55-year-old son slammed Clooney for undermining his father with the essay, asking the actor, \"What right do you have to step on a man who's given 52 years of his ... life to the service of this country?\"\n\nClooney told CBS he could \"spend a lot of time debunking\" the \"outright lies\" that Hunter Biden said about him, including the claim that former President Barack Obama told him to write the essay. \"Obama didn't put me up to it,\" Clooney said.\n\nBut the \"Ocean's Eleven\" star added, \"I don't think looking backwards like that is helpful to anyone, particularly to him. I don't think it's helpful for the Democratic Party.\"\n\nClooney has previously defended publishing his New York Times essay in the wake of Harris' 2024 election loss. In April, he told CNN it was his \"civic duty\" to write the piece.\n\nOn \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\" in February, Clooney reacted to Trump's election win, saying he has the same attitude about the Democrats' loss that he encourages his son to have when he loses games of chess.\n\n\"He gets upset, and I (tell him), listen, you shake the guy's hand, you say, 'Good game, I'll get you next time,'\" Clooney said. \"You've got to live by those rules, which is, 'Alright, good. Good for you. Go. I hope you do well, because our country needs it, and then we'll meet you in three-and-a-half years and see where we go next.'\"",

        "title": "Can Trump move the Olympics out of LA?",
        "description": "LOS ANGELES -- Since Donald Trump has returned to the White House, Olympics, LA 28 and FIFA officials have lavished the president with praise, attention and gifts, and contributed hundreds of thousands of dollars to the campaign war chests of the Republican Party and Trump's political allies amid rising concerns that Trump could seriously undermine the 2026 World Cup and the 2028 Olympic Games or even prevent the two most watched events on planet from even taking place.\n\nLA 28 chairman Casey Wasserman even made a pilgrimage to Mar-a-Lago, Trump's Palm Beach estate, in January, just days before the inauguration. FIFA president Gianni Infantino brought along the World Cup trophy on a visit to the Oval Office.\n\nOnly the \"winners\" are allowed to hold it, Infantino told Trump as he handed the trophy to the president.\n\nYet the fawning has not prevented Trump from threatening to move the Olympic Games out of Los Angeles and relocate World Cup matches from Blue State strongholds such as the Boston area, Seattle and the Bay Area.\n\n\"If I thought LA was not going to be prepared properly, I would move it to another location,\" Trump told reporters earlier this month. \"(California governor) Gavin Newsom, he's got to get his act together.\"\n\nTrump cannot legally remove the Olympic Games from Los Angeles but the administration's control over federal funding and visas could be used as leverage against Olympic and World Cup organizers to extract concessions that could threaten the integrity and success of the global events, according to current and former IOC members, Olympic historians and experts and current and former Los Angeles city and county officials told the Southern California News Group, and according to contracts and other documents related to the Olympics and World Cup.\n\n\"He's the president of the United States and that's the host nation, so you have to pay some attention to him,\" said Dick Pound, a former IOC vice president from Canada. \"But he does not own the Games, notwithstanding creating himself as chairman of whatever that committee is, the task force. He's not in charge of the Games. The IOC would have to consent to any change. Not only the venues but the Olympic city. \"\n\n\"There are a number of ways he can gum up the works,\" said Zev Yaroslavsky, a long-time Los Angeles County board of supervisors member who was on the Los Angeles city council during the 1984 Olympic Games.\n\nWhen asked if Trump could move the Summer Games out of Los Angeles, Penn State professor Mark S. Dyreson said, \"Well, in a technical sense, no. The IOC controls the hosting of the Olympic Games. But he's got a lot of power to make things miserable for the IOC if he wants to.\n\n\"He could just bar athletes from outside the U.S. from coming into the U.S. so it wouldn't be much of an Olympics,\" continued Dyreson, author of \"Crafting Patriotism for Global Domination: America at the Olympic Games. \"So I'm sure the IOC is pulling their hair out, wondering what's going to happen.\n\n\"That image of him grabbing the World Cup trophy is scaring a lot of people.\"\n\nA trepidation toward Trump, if not outright fear, is evident in the hallways of FIFA and IOC's Zurich and Lausanne headquarters and the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee's Colorado Springs offices.\n\nIOC, FIFA, U.S. Olympic and Paralympic and LA 28 officials, concerned about upsetting the president and his staff, have gone to great lengths to avoid or not directly answer questions about the potential Trump impact on Los Angeles hosting its third Olympic Games and the World Cup, newly expanded to 48 teams and played in 11 U.S. cities including Inglewood and Santa Clara as well as venues to Canada and Mexico.\n\nIOC vice president Nicole Hoevertsz, who is overseeing Los Angeles' preparations for the Games, referred questions about Trump to an IOC spokesperson who issued a statement on behalf of the organization: \"The Olympic Games LA28 have the full support of the President of the United States, the Governor of California and the Mayor of Los Angeles. All of them are being extremely helpful in the preparations for these Games. This is mirrored on the operational level of the administration. There are three years to go, and we are confident that LA28 will be a great Olympic Games.\"\n\nThe USOPC declined comment for this story.\n\n\"The President is doing everything to make the upcoming World Cup and Olympics the safest ever,\" a White House official said in a statement to the SCNG.\n\n\"I try and keep really focused on doing our job,\" Wasserman said during a recent conference at USC. \"I try not to get caught up in the noise, because if you get caught in the noise, I think you lose your way a little bit.\"\n\nBut it's hard to tune out the noise when Trump continues to make statements threatening to send federal troops to Los Angeles during the Games, relocate the Games and move World Cup matches.\n\n\"We'll do anything necessary to keep the Olympics safe, including using our National Guard or military,\" Trump said during an August 5 ceremony in which he signed an executive order creating a federal task force on the Olympics, which he will head. Trump also created a federal task force for the World Cup in May. He will serve as the chairman of the World Cup task force as well.\n\nDuring the August ceremony, which was attended by Wasserman and Gene Sykes, the USOPC chairman and an IOC member, Trump referred to Mayor Karen Bass as \"not very competent.\"\n\n\"I think it's part of the theater that is part of the Trump administration, unfortunately, and I just think we have to go about our business putting on the finest summer Games that the world has ever seen,\" said Marqueece Harris-Dawson, Los Angeles City Council president and chairman of the council's ad hoc committee on the Olympics, said in an interview with SCNG.\n\n\"Unfortunately, it causes a lot of insecurity and anxiety among our residents and businesses, especially. We've got businesses that are preparing and have been preparing for years to do business with the Olympics, with FIFA. So when you get a statement like that, obviously they get worried that perhaps their investment can be invalidated by the whims of one individual. But in terms of individuals on the city side doing the work, we continue to press ahead.\n\n\"My read on all of this, and it's impossible to read the minds of people in the Trump administration, but all of this to me is just slow drip fascism. I think he's trying to get the country to adjust to fascism. And if you study the history of fascism, this is what leaders do. That is what I see happening . Fortunately for all of us, not just for Angelenos, we see a great deal of resistance to that, whether it's Chicago, Portland, here and Los Angeles and beyond, I think this will go on for some time.\"\n\nSome of that anxiety was also visible during the Los Angeles City Council's ad hoc Olympic committee meeting on Wednesday.\n\n\"The president wants these Games to succeed,\" LA 28 CEO Reynold N. Hoover said during the meeting.\n\n\"I think the administration is committed to a great Games, and I think, you know, as I've said before and said to members of Congress, there's no better place than the city of LA to host the Games, and nobody else can do it to this size,\" Hoover said later in a brief interview with SCNG.\n\nBut city council member Bob Blumenfield did not appear to share Hoover's confidence in Trump.\n\n\"What I'm concerned about is, while they're being cooperative now, at some point, they're going to do what they've done with funding to universities and others, and they're going to create a condition that we cannot meet,\" Blumenfield told Hoover and LA 28 chief operating officer John Harper. \"You know, they're going to have a social issue, they're going to trans issues or immigration issues or something like that. They have a history of doing (that) and make our money contingent or our security contingent on such a policy. What protections do we have in place to protect us against that kind of last-minute extortion?\"\n\n\"What I can tell you is that up to this point, no one in the federal government, no one in the White House, and no one at the departments of agencies that we've met with has put a condition on any support for the Games,\" Hoover responded. \"I've spoken directly with FEMA leadership on the money, the billion dollars, and there are no conditions attached to those dollars.\n\n\"What the administration will do later?\" Hoover continued, \"I wouldn't sit here and say or predict what they will do.\"\n\nBlumenfield was unmoved.\n\n\"You may be prepared,\" he said. \"I don't trust this President to not do that. And yeah, so just just, we don't need to vet a strategy here, but just please be vetting strategies about contingencies and ways we can protect ourselves.\"\n\nThe Olympic Games are projected to generate $6.88 billion in revenue. Hoover said LA 28 has already secured $1.7 billion of its targeted goal of $2.5 billion in sponsorship revenue.\n\nThe World Cup will generate $8.9 billion in revenue, according to FIFA projections. The eight matches played at SoFi Stadium are projected to have a $594 billion economic impact on the Southern California market and generate $34.9 million in tax revenue within Los Angeles County, according to a study by an economic research and consulting firm commissioned by the Los Angeles World Cup host committee.\n\nThose revenues would be greatly reduced if LA 28 or local organizing committees had to fully cover the cost of providing security for those events. Trump's so-called One Big Beautiful Bill Act set aside $1 billion in federal funding for security at the 2028 Olympics.\n\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency announced this week it was allocating $625 million in security funding to the 11 U.S. World Cup host cities.\n\n\"We can't hide from the fact that you can't deliver an Olympics without the full engagement of the federal government,\" Wasserman said at the USC conference. \"Everything we've asked them to do, they have done, and they have done so without conditions placed on them. They deserve a ton of credit for delivering and understanding what we need and not placing conditions on it.\n\n\"We need to double the size of LA Metro for 30 days and that's only done with the Department of Transportation. We need the IRS to change tax laws so they don't tax athletes for winning gold medals.\"\n\nWhich gives Trump a lot of leverage, current and former IOC members and longtime Olympic and FIFA watchers maintain.\n\n\"Trump can really mess up some things, right?\" said Holy Cross professor Victor Matheson, co-author of \"Going for the Gold: The Economics of the Olympics.\" \"You know, he really does have a level of power in federal agencies like the State Department that are wildly problematic if the US government were to declare every single person coming in from a variety of World Cup countries to be national security threats. We seem to have given him pretty much carte blanche to do that sort of thing and impose billions of dollars of tariffs. If we're willing to do that, he certainly has the ability to block soccer players from a bunch of different countries from coming in, which, of course, destroys the tournament. So he's got that card to play.\"\n\nOne card Trump can't play is moving the Games out of Los Angeles, former and current IOC members and Los Angeles city and council officials said.\n\nThe Games were awarded to Los Angeles on September 13, 2017, by the IOC in an unprecedented move in which the 2024 Olympics were given to Paris at the same time. The IOC and the City of Los Angeles signed a host city contract in which any moving of venues requires approval of the IOC and the city. An agreement between the city and LA 28 also requires that any venue outside city be approved by the city council.\n\n\"LA won the Games fair and square based on our excellent proposal to the International Olympic Committee,\" said Janice Hahn, a Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors member. \"This has been quite literally a decade in the making. The President can't just move the Games.\"\n\nPound, one of the most influential figures in the Olympic movement in the past 50 years, agreed.\n\n\"He can ask for the Games to be canceled because of the perceived civil unrest or whatever the vocabulary will be at the time,\" Pound said, referring to Trump. \"But he can't say we're going to put them in Kansas City. The Games are awarded to a city, and the city and the national Olympic committee and the USOPC have to form an organizing committee for the purpose of making all the necessary arrangements. You can move venues around. You can have an accident in the stadium and it's no longer fit for the purpose, so you can say we're going to do the basketball in some other venue. But you're not at liberty to move the Games around from a city without the consent of the IOC and presumably the USOPC.\n\n\"In a sense, one of the things you have to do is separate what he says, because often it's a very undisciplined series of utterances, and instead look at what he actually does. And that has been somewhat less threatening than all of this. But I mean to say, Los Angeles is too dangerous to hold the Games, frankly, is silly.\"\n\nMoving World Cup matches out of Seattle, Santa Clara or Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts, outside of Boston, would be difficult but not impossible, Matheson said.\n\nFor one thing, the U.S. has a wealth of stadiums capable of hosting a World Cup match. The World Cup organizing committee had more than 40 stadiums on its initial list of candidate venues.\n\n\"I love the people of Boston. I know the games are sold out, but your mayor is not good,\" Trump said when asked recently by reporters if he was serious about moving World Cup matches out of Foxborough, referring to Boston Mayor Michelle Wu. \"I think she is hurting Boston. The answer is yes: If somebody is doing a bad job, and if I feel there's unsafe conditions, I would call Gianni, the head of FIFA, who's phenomenal, and I would say, let's move it to another location.\"\n\n\"It probably is possible to move games, certainly FIFA games, it can be done, but it's expensive, and it's especially as expensive now because they've already started to sell large numbers of tickets, right, right?\" Matheson said. \"Moving the Olympics out of LA to Dallas would be impossible. So there are some things that are possible and easy, and so you do that to placate Trump, but you got to be careful about whether he's going to follow through. And, you know, there are some things that are wildly expensive that you can't just say, \"OK, fine, we'll move all the games from Boston to, you know, to a city of more of my liking.'\n\n\"But the very suggestion that it should be moved (out of Foxborough) for national security reasons is simply untrue. It's a lie.\"\n\nBoston has the lowest murder rate for any major NFL market, according to the most recent FBI statistics.\n\nWhile Hoover said he and Wasserman have had talks with Secretary of State Marco Rubio about a pathway that would make it easier for foreign athletes, officials and other individuals with Olympic-related jobs or duties to enter the U.S., the visa process remains a major concern for Olympic, World Cup and local officials.\n\n\"Given what he's already doing with immigration and the State Department, you could see a scenario where he targets certain countries and just makes it almost impossible for the IOC to be willing to hold an Olympics in the U.S. in 2028,\" Dyreson said. \"He's certainly not fond of California, it seems. It would be a huge PR disaster for him, but who knows what his calculations are.\"\n\nTrump is hardly the first difficult head of state the IOC and FIFA have had to deal with. And both FIFA and the IOC have been besieged by bribery scandals involving top organization officials and prominent members of local organizing committees.\n\nWhile Trump cannot legally pull the Games from Los Angeles, under the terms of the host city contract, the IOC is \"entitled to terminate the HCC and to withdraw the Games from the Host City, the Host (national Olympic committee) and the (local organizing committee),\" although such a move would highly unlikely barring a natural disaster or pandemic.\n\nAmong the conditions for removing the Games, \"a state of war, civil disorder, boycott, embargo decreed by the international community or in a situation officially recognized as one of belligerence or if the IOC has reasonable grounds to believe that the health or safety of participants in the Games would be seriously threatened or jeopardized for any reason.\"\n\n\"The whole thing is a total and utter mess at the moment,\" Dyreson said. \"How much will the IOC bend? Will we be allowed to ban countries which oppose Trump's policies or he considers enemies? How much will the IOC give up on this notion that it's supposed to be a global celebration? It's not free of politics. No one buys that notion. But can he keep out Venezuela or Colombia or Denmark, whoever he's mad at at the moment? I think it has people's heads spinning at the moment, and they are hoping for the best but preparing for the worst and how much do you have to placate his ego?\"\n\nUltimately, the card the IOC, LA 28 and FIFA might have is playing to that ego.\n\n\"Trump desperately wants to be on TV in front of a billion people, and FIFA says, 'Well, guess what? You're not. You're no longer welcome at this event in any way,'\" Matheson said. \"That's a pretty powerful card to play against a president who desperately always wants to be in the center of attention. And this is literally the largest television audience of any single event on the planet in any given four-year period. That's the World Cup. And of course, the same thing about the Olympics. Trump desperately wants to be a part of those opening ceremonies and the closing ceremonies, and desperately wants to be a star in these sort of things. So again, that's what, obviously, what the IOC, that's their card to play again, the IOC.\"\n\n\"Would he really not let the Olympics come to the United States?\" Dyerson said, \"Because it's going to be such a grand stage for him to prance around on. I can't believe his ego would let him kill it.\"\n\nSaid Yaroslavsky, Trump \"craves attention. He craves to convince everyone that he's in charge of everything. He just wants to be the center of attention.\"\n\nAnd that's where Infantino and Wasserman have placed Trump.\n\nAt the ceremony announcing the Olympic task force, Wasserman presented Trump with a complete set of medals from the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles.\n\n\"Your support and the entire administration's support through this entire process has truly been extraordinary,\" Wasserman told Trump during the ceremony.\n\nWasserman referred to a December 2016 meeting with Trump, shortly after his election and nine months before IOC election that resulted in the 2028 Games being award to Los Angeles.\n\n\"You've been supportive and helpful every step of the way,\" Wasserman said, \"and we wouldn't be here without you.\"\n\nTrump's political allies haven't just received Wasserman's attention. Wasserman is a longtime and prominent financial backer of Democratic candidates nationwide. Since Los Angeles was awarded the Games in September 2017, he has contributed at least $3.68 million to candidates running for federal office, according to Federal Election Commission records.\n\nBut Wasserman has also contributed at least $182,000 to Republican candidates since October 2024. Since Trump's inauguration, he has contributed $50,000 to Speaker of the House Mike Johnson's PAC, $38,000 to the National Republican Congressional Committee and $50,000 to the National Republican Senate Committee.\n\nWasserman also co-hosted with former Paramount Pictures chairwoman Sherry Lansing a September fundraiser for Senator Susan Collins, a Maine Republican who is seen as one of the GOP's most vulnerable candidates in the 2026 election. Tickets for the event at Lansing's Bel Air home cost between $3,000 and $10,000.\n\nInfantino's courtship of Trump has led several publications to describe it as a \"Bromance.\" The FIFA president invited Trump to hand out medals to the winning players at the summer's FIFA World Club Cup final. FIFA opened an office in Trump Tower in New York City over the summer. FIFA also switched December's World Cup draw from the Sphere in Las Vegas to the Kennedy Center in Washington, a move suggested by the Trump administration and first announced by Trump in the Oval Office. Trump will be the guest of honor.\n\n\"Some people refer to it as the 'Trump Kennedy Center,' but we're not prepared to do that quite yet,\" Trump said. \"Maybe in a week or so.\"\n\nInfantino has been a frequent guest at the Oval Office. He has met with Trump at least eight times since January, five times in the Oval Office, according to White House records. The president was wearing a red baseball cap that read \"TRUMP WAS RIGHT ABOUT EVERYTHING\" when Infantino, during an August Oval Office visit, placed the World Cup trophy in Trump's hands.\n\nThe symbolism of the moment was not lost on IOC and FIFA officials.",

        "title": "California law to protect Jewish students faces challenge over free speech concerns",
        "description": "SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee is challenging a new California law designed to protect Jewish students from discrimination, arguing it is unconstitutionally vague and violates their free speech rights.\n\nThe federal complaint, filed Sunday in San Jose, seeks to invalidate legislation Gov. Gavin Newsom signed last month, creating an Office of Civil Rights to help schools identify and prevent antisemitism. State lawmakers approved the legislation as political tensions have flared in the U.S. over Israel's war in Gaza.\n\nThe new law, which takes effect Jan. 1, does not define antisemitism but gives educators the impression that they could be charged with discrimination \"if they expose their students to ideas, information, and instructional materials that may be considered critical of the State of Israel and the philosophy of Zionism,\" according to the complaint.\n\nJenin Younes, national legal director at the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, says the lack of guidance has a chilling effect on speech among educators.\n\n\"They censor themselves very broadly because they don't know what's going to get them into trouble,\" she said.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed on behalf of individual teachers and students in California public schools, and the Los Angeles Educators for Justice in Palestine.\n\nIn the complaint, middle school science teacher Jonah Olson, says students at his rural, largely Christian school district, often ask him what it means to be Jewish. He responds in part by saying that his Judaism does not include support for the State of Israel, and now he fears that might violate the law.\n\nParents who are part of the lawsuit say they fear their children will be prevented from learning about differing perspectives on Israel, Palestinians and the Middle East.\n\nStudents in public schools nationwide are generally protected against discrimination through state, federal and district policies, but supporters of the law say they needed to do more given a surge in harassment and bullying of Jewish and Israeli students.\n\nThe Anti-Defamation League, which supports the new law, said 860 antisemitic acts such as harassment, vandalism and assault were reported to the group last year at non-Jewish K-12 schools nationwide. The number is a 26% decrease from the previous year but much higher than the 494 reported in 2022.",

        "description": "Oscar-winning actor George Clooney said he regrets that Democrats tapped then-Vice President Kamala Harris to be the party's standard-bearer after Joe Biden ended his bid for a second term in July 2024.\n\nIn an interview with CBS News \"Sunday Morning,\" the \"Syriana\" and \"O Brother Where Art Thou?\" star stood by his blistering New York Times op-ed in which he stated bluntly that Biden could not defeat Donald Trump due to his cognitive decline.\n\n\"I wanted there to be, as I wrote in the op-ed, a primary,\" the 64-year-old said. \"Let's battle-test this quickly and get it up and going.\"\n\n\"I think the mistake with it being Kamala is that she had to run against her own record,\" Clooney went on. \"It's very hard to do if the point of running is to say, 'I'm not that person.' It's hard to do, and so she was given a very tough task. I think it was a mistake, quite honestly.\"\n\nFollowing Biden's fumbling June 27, 2024, debate performance against Trump, Clooney acknowledged in his Times piece that the 46th president exhibited the same feebleness at a star-studded Los Angeles fundraiser the actor co-hosted days earlier.\n\nIn their best-selling book \"Original Sin,\" co-authors Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson reported that Biden didn't recognize Clooney at the fundraiser, despite the two being friendly for more than two decades.\n\nIn the Times op-ed, the actor urged Democrats to hold a mini-primary ahead of the party's August national convention, to include Harris, California Gov. Gavin Newsom, and Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, among others.\n\nInstead, Biden dropped out and endorsed Harris almost immediately, ending any hope of an open competition.\n\nReflecting on the events of last summer and their effect on the Democratic Party, the \"Batman & Robin\" star told CBS: \"We are where we are.\"\n\n\"We were gonna lose more House seats, they say [if Biden had stayed in]. So I don't know. To not do it [the op-ed] would be to say, 'I'm not gonna tell the truth.'\"\n\nHowever, Clooney added that Biden should be praised for the \"selfless act\" of doing \"the hardest thing to do.\"\n\n\"It's very hard to let go of power,\" he said. \"We know that; we've seen it all around the world -- and for someone to say, 'I think there's a better way forward,' all the credit goes to him, and that's really the truth.\"\n\nOver the summer, the A-lister was criticized by former first son Hunter Biden during a foul-mouthed podcast interview.\n\n\"F -- k him and everybody around him, I don't have to be f -- king nice,\" Hunter fumed in an interview with YouTube personality Andrew Callaghan.\n\n\"Number one, I agree with [director] Quentin Tarantino, George Clooney is not a f -- king actor ... he is a brand,\" Hunter continued. \"He's great friends with [former President] Barack Obama. F -- k you. What do you have to do with f -- king anything? Why do I have to f -- king listen to you?\"",

Abigail Spanberger and Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears.\n\nThe New Jersey race pits Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill against Republican businessman and former state lawmaker Jack Ciattarelli.\n\nZohran Mamdani, the front-runner in polling to become mayor of New York City, laughed off Trump's criticism while stumping for votes. Mamdani is campaigning against Andrew Cuomo, the Democratic former governor, and Curtis Sliwa, the Republican founder of the anti-crime group Guardian Angels.\n\nHere are updates on last-minute campaigning before the Nov. 4 election:\n\nTrump to rally supporters in Virginia, New Jersey by phone\n\nTrump plans to hold tele-rallies Nov. 3 for the gubernatorial candidates.\n\nHe is scheduled to call Virginia supporters at 7 p.m. ET from the Oval Office. He is then set to call New Jersey supporters at 7:30 p.m.\n\nTrump said in a post on truth social Nov. 2 that voting for Republicans in either of the seats would lead to a drop in energy prices. He has promoted oil and gas development, in contrast to many Democrats promoting renewable fuels to curb climate change.\n\nMamdani laughs off Trump comments\n\nZohran Mamdani, the front-runner for New York mayor, laughed when asked what he thought of Trump saying he was the better looking of the two.\n\n\"My focus is on the cost of living crisis, bro,\" Mamdani told reporters.\n\nMamdani is campaigning as a democratic socialist. But Trump has blasted him as a communist and warned he wouldn't support federal funding for New York if Mamdani wins.\n\nDuring \"60 Minutes\" interview broadcast Nov. 2, Norah O'Donnell asked for Trump's reaction to comparisons that both politicians are charismatic and break rules.\n\n\"Well, I think I'm a much better looking person than him,\" Trump said.\n\nMamdani walks across Brooklyn Bridge for Manhattan rally\n\nMamdani walked across the Brooklyn Bridge early Nov. 3 with state Attorney General Letitia James and others before holding a news conference outside City Hall in Manhattan.\n\nCalifornians to vote on congressional redistricting\n\nCalifornians will be voting on a ballot measure to redraw congressional maps for the 2026 midterm election.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom pursued the changes with a goal of flipping five Republican seats to Democrats, to combat redistricting in Texas that favored Republicans in five seats now held by Democrats.\n\nRedistricting occurs every decade based on the Census but Trump has encouraged Republican-led states to redraw their maps to keep control of the House, where Republicans lead 219 to 213.",

        "title": "America, the Juvenile",
        "description": "The Trump administration is a regime of troubled grade-schoolers.\n\nIn 1949, the German historian and political philosopher Hannah Arendt visited Europe for the first time since fleeing to America during the war. A year later, she wrote an analysis of what she called \"the aftermath of Nazi rule.\" She found the Old World lacking in civic maturity and commitment compared with her new home, the then-booming United States, noting that \"the peoples of Western Europe have developed the habit of blaming their misfortunes on some force out of their reach.\" She believed that her adopted country, by comparison, enjoyed a kind of clarity of public vision: \"With the possible exception of the Scandinavians,\" she wrote, \"no European citizenry has the political maturity of Americans, for whom a certain amount of responsibility, i.e., of moderation in the pursuit of self-interest, is almost a matter of course.\" Arendt wasn't celebrating a perfect America; rather, she was lauding a people who approached political life with an adult sensibility and a reserve of self-control.\n\nArendt, and any judicious observer, could not make the same assessment of America today.\n\nThe United States is now a nation run by public servants who behave no better than internet trolls, deflecting criticism with crassness and obscenity. The White House press secretary answers a question from a member of the free press -- a serious question about who planned a meeting between the American and Russian presidents -- by saying, \"Your mom did.\" The secretary of defense cancels DEI and other policies by saying, \"We are done with that shit.\" The vice president calls an interlocutor on social media a \"dipshit.\" The president of the United States himself, during mass protests against his policies, responds by posting an AI-generated video of himself flying a jet fighter over his fellow citizens and dumping feces on their heads.\n\nAnne Applebaum: Why Trump turned to the sewer\n\nThese are not the actions of mature adults. They are examples of crude people displaying their incompetence as they flail about in jobs -- including the presidency -- for which they are not qualified.\n\nThe republic will not fall because Vice President J. D. Vance has decided that swearing is edgy, and the juvenility of American public life did not begin with the Trump administration. But the larger danger under all of this nastiness is that President Donald Trump and his courtiers are using crass deflection and gleeful immaturity as means of numbing society and wearing down its resistance to all kinds of depredations, including corruption and violence. When the U.S. military kills people at sea and Vance, responding to a charge that such actions might be war crimes, responds, \"I don't give a shit what you call it,\" the goal is not just to boost Vance's hairy-chest cred; it's also to grind others down into accepting the idea of extrajudicial executions.\n\nThe collapse of a superpower into a regime of bullies and mean girls and comic-book guys explains much about why American democracy is on the ropes, reeling from the attacks of people who in a better time would never have been allowed near the government of the United States.\n\nFor years, Trump has attracted acolytes by being the patron saint of the third string, gathering people who seem to feel, for various reasons, that they were iced out of national politics. Some hold opinions too extreme for any but a Trump administration. Stephen Miller's odious views, including his echoing of Adolf Hitler's rhetoric and his accusation that the president's critics are terrorists, would make him a liability not just in any other administration but even at a family dinner, as remarks from some of his own relatives have suggested.\n\nOther Trump appointees, however, have used personal loyalty as the bridge across the chasm that separates their lack of ability from the jobs they occupy. The experiences of prior Trump appointees suggest that many of the current crew know they are in over their head, which could explain much about their churlish and unprofessional behavior.\n\nConsider the candid admissions of Stephanie Grisham, a press secretary in Trump's first term who later walked away from Trump. In 2021, she explained to New York magazine why she took the job in the first place.\n\nTo be fair, many reasonable people have the same kind of awestruck moment when they arrive in Washington. (I certainly felt overwhelmed many years ago when I showed up for my first day of work in the Senate.) But Grisham admits to a deeper insecurity: \"I thought that they\" -- the Trump team -- \"were the only ones who would ever get me there. My lack of confidence in myself as a single mother and someone who has made mistakes in my past, I thought, Well, this is my only shot. Nobody's gonna ever want me, really, but these people did. So I'll stick around.\"\n\nThis kind of private insecurity can manifest in public life as childishness and trollishness. Or maybe such behavior is simply a reflection of the man at the top. Like all schoolyard bullies, Trump is crude and surrounds himself with people who will not challenge him. Thus his appointees, instead of rising to their responsibilities as public servants, emulate their boss's shallow swagger. Instead of advising the president, they seek to placate him. Instead of showing leadership, they replace their own dignity with loyalty to Trump and do whatever it takes to stay out of the Eye of Sauron.\n\nWhatever the reason for their immaturity, the effect is miserable policy and a corroded democracy. The public is poorly served and does not get answers to important questions. Tariffs? Inflation? Immigration? Peace or war? Who's responsible for these choices?\n\nYour mother, apparently.\n\nThe corruption, mendacity, and incompetence of those in charge are perhaps less astonishing than the willingness of Trump's most loyal supporters to tolerate them all. By now, any other president would have been restrained by Congress or, as happened in 2020, by voters. In Trump's second term, however, his base seems almost eager to forgive him for anything, with the possible exception of his involvement with the deceased sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nBut Trump's popular support (which is probably firmest in the range of some 35 to 40 percent of the U.S. population but much higher within the GOP) is not as much a mystery as it might appear. Americans of all political leanings have been poisoned for years by memes and disinformation. They have marinated in the nihilism of a culture that regards everything with a kind of post-ironic glib dismissal. (As usual, The Simpsons was ahead of its time: A 1996 episode shows two teens at a music festival, where one asks the other, \"Are you being sarcastic, dude?\" The other, crestfallen, says: \"I don't even know anymore.\")\n\nPerhaps Trump's voters have become like the members of the administration, delighting in the crassness and obscenity that pours out of the president and his circle whenever they are challenged. The White House's approach to social media in particular, as my colleague Ali Breland wrote recently, \"now resembles the polemical, trolling, vicious manner of posting\" pioneered by white supremacists such as Nick Fuentes and his fans, who have become more visible participants in the MAGA movement during Trump's second term.\n\nFriedrich Nietzsche created a concept that can help us understand this political moment. He imported a word from French to describe a kind of deep-seated anger that goes beyond transitory gripes: ressentiment, a feeling that comes from a combination of insecurity, an amorphous envy, and a generalized sense of resentment. Citizens engulfed by this emotion want to bring others down to what they think is their own underappreciated station and identify scapegoats to bear the blame for their misfortunes, real or imagined. They are driven by grievance and a continual, unfocused sense of injury. Accordingly, they see politics as a way to get even with almost everyone outside of their immediate circle. A Trump voter put out of work during the 2019 government shutdown captured this mentality when she exclaimed: \"He's not hurting the people he needs to be hurting.\"\n\nSociologists and political scientists have long been aware of the effects of ressentiment on entire nations, not least because it is often a red flag: a marker of a society ripe for decay into authoritarianism. And that is where the danger lies in the juvenility and coarseness among both the Trump elite and its most loyal supporters, some of whom treat grave issues of national and even global importance as little more than raw material for mean-spirited jokes and obscene memes. This shallow behavior leads to a deadening of the moral and civic spirit that undergirds democracy.\n\nPeople who are willing to accept \"your mom\" as an answer to important questions are people who have already decided that democracy is a rigged game. The political process, for many of them, doesn't seem to be a means for solving common problems and developing solid policies. Instead, they treat it as just another opportunity to excoriate their fellow citizens. They may support candidates such as Trump (and the late Silvio Berlusconi in Italy, and the now-imprisoned former leaders Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines and Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil) not because they expect responsible government, but because such candidates promise to hurt the right people -- to humiliate them, impoverish them, and perhaps even shoot them.\n\nWhat can other American citizens do when faced with a government that offers trolling and obscenity as replacements for governing? How do people who care about democracy and the rule of law deal with fellow voters who keep electing a class of public officials who seem to be all id and no superego?\n\nPerhaps most important, other Americans should model the behavior they hope to foster in their friends and neighbors. Populist ressentiment is not necessarily produced by inequality. It's driven by a perception of inequality, a sense of being looked down on by others. It is a demand for attention and emotional engagement. But trying to answer that demand is a fool's errand: On social media, for example, some of Trump's voters seem especially enraged not by arguments but by indifference. The whole point of their trolling is to gain attention and then intimidate others.\n\nBoth online and in daily life, Americans who are part of the pro-democracy coalition should resist such invitations. Responsible citizens must hold themselves to a higher standard than officials who are acting like grade-schoolers. The national figures, from Trump on down, who put out rancid bait may do so because they want others to argue and lower themselves, and thus prove that no one holds the moral high ground. (Perhaps this is why Trump and so many of his supporters resort to whataboutism when confronted with their behavior.) When these leaders and their followers swear or behave rudely, they may hope and expect that others will do likewise.\n\nAs tempting as it is to trade punches to the groin, the better approach is to model mature behavior and demand it in return from people being paid to serve the public. When the White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt answered the journalist S. V. D\u00e1te's text-message question about who chose the location of a possible U.S.-Russia summit with \"Your mom did,\" D\u00e1te texted back: \"Is this funny to you?\" Leavitt then went full Regina George, calling him a \"far left hack\" and refusing to answer his \"bullshit questions.\" Leavitt later posted the exchange on X, where D\u00e1te responded: \"Feel better now? Now can you answer the question? Please and thank you.\" That's the only way to go: Ask the question, and then ask it again, and keep asking.\n\nRead: Steven Cheung is the voice of Trump\n\nThis is not Michelle Obama's \"When they go low, we go high\" argument. (Even she seems to have abandoned that strategy.) Rather, it is a recognition -- and a plea -- that the voters and candidates who wish to replace this current government must present themselves as stable, responsible, and adult alternatives to a claque of trolls and incompetents. (Even California Governor Gavin Newsom's troll-back of the president, as clever as it was, has run its course.) The right answer now to the faux-macho silliness of someone such as Pete Hegseth is not to produce clever memes and nicknames for the secretary of defense; it is to remind people that Hegseth is acting like a teenager and trying to distract Americans with idiotic slurs about fat soldiers because Pete Hegseth is terrible at his job.\n\nLike most things that require some adulting, this approach is emotionally unsatisfying. And it may not gain much ground if enough Americans have decided that they are satisfied with poop jokes as public policy. The \"No Kings\" protests, however, are an example of how people can mobilize to mock ridiculous behavior (and do so festively, even) without the mayhem that Trump and his lieutenants seemed to hope would arise.\n\nIn addition to marching, Americans who care about democracy must organize and vote in every election, no matter how small or local. And in their personal lives, people who want to restore maturity to national government must be clear with those around them, even if it means risking their personal relationships, that some things, such as glib schoolyard taunts and scatological nonsense from the commander in chief, are not acceptable.\n\nAmericans have learned that guardrails are easily destroyed. Restoring them will take time -- because they have to be repaired by each of us, one person at a time, making small but important decisions about how we want to live.",

        "title": "Newsom's obscene $250M redistricting proves the urgent need for The...",
        "description": "Governor Gavin Newsom will soon almost certainly be celebrating the passage of Proposition 50, a referendum to cast aside the state's \"independent\" congressional map in favor of one drawn by Democrats, for Democrats.\n\nProp 50 is certainly good for Newsom and his party, but it is bad for California. And it highlights the lack of political accountability in the once-Golden State, which suffers some of the worst governance in America.\n\nNewsom sold Prop 50 to the electorate using the same tactics he deployed to survive the 2021 recall vote: he told Democrats that if he lost, President Donald Trump and his supporters would win.\n\nProp 50 actually disenfranchises millions of Californians, but Newsom convinced his party's voters that they would \"defend democracy\" by stripping most Republicans of their seats and helping Democrats retake the U.S. House.\n\nTo that end, Newsom spent more than $250 million of California taxpayers' money -- this in a state that has suffered large budget deficits for two years in a row.\n\n(Republican Assemblyman Carl DeMaio of San Diego correctly predicted the cost -- a pesky habit of his, which is why fellow politicians, mostly Democrats, voted him the \"worst\" legislator in Sacramento. For taxpayers and constituent interests, DeMaio is one of the best.)\n\nPolitical donors spent at least that much money, with Newsom's camp far outspending opponents of Prop 50, even with millions donated by moderate Republican Charles Munger, Jr. (Prop 50 was too far, even for \"RINOs\" like Munger and former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, who is no fan of Trump.)\n\nThat's at least half a billion spent on a special election whose only purpose was to boost national Democratic Party fortunes.\n\nMeanwhile, tens of thousands of residents of fire-ravaged Pacific Palisades, Altadena, and other areas affected by the Los Angeles fires remain displaced.\n\nMany had lost their insurance before the fires -- thanks to Newsom's policies -- and were forced onto the California FAIR (or \"unfair\") plan. Many cannot make up the difference between insurance payouts and the cost of rebuilding. Many may be forced to sell, cheaply.\n\nHalf a billion dollars would help residents rebuild their homes -- homes they lost, in part, due to the negligence of state and local officials, who failed to clear the brush, fill the reservoirs, and deploy the firefighters.\n\nWhen Newsom vetoed SB 236, which would require the state to develop a wildfire mitigation plan, he said it would cost too much -- up to $20 million per year. But he found the money for Prop 50.\n\nThe passage of Prop 50 is a sign that national politics have eclipsed state and local politics. We care more about who is running Washington than what is going on in our own backyards.\n\nAnd the only reason that is possible is that the California media, collectively, have failed to hold Newsom and other elected officials accountable. There is no outlet capable or projecting a statewide voice -- until the California Post. Until now.\n\nProp 50 also represents the personal vanity of one man -- Newsom -- who has placed his presidential ambitions ahead of the state's interests. He has launched outrageous personal attacks on the president, while still begging Congress and the administration to approve $40 billion in additional fire aid.\n\nOf course, Trump is hostile to his political foes, but unlike Newsom, Trump actually gets things done for his voters.\n\nNewsom cannot point to a single major accomplishment in nearly two terms as governor. He seems to think his primary responsibility is trolling Republicans in other states.\n\nHe has failed to build high-speed rail; his electric vehicle mandate was done in by weak sales before Trump took office; his billions in spending on homelessness has made the problem worse. California also leads the nation in poverty and unemployment.\n\nProp 50 represents Newsom's gamble that Democratic Party primary voters care more about a candidate who fights Trump than a candidate who achieves results.\n\nOne can, in theory, do both: look at San Francisco mayor Daniel Lurie, who convinced Trump to cancel a \"surge\" of federal law enforcement to the city. Lurie didn't call Trump names, or attack him directly. He opposed Trump's policy, but spoke to him personally.\n\nThat is how principled opposition is meant to be practiced. Newsom has abandoned that approach for a caricature of what Democrats believe Trump to be: mean, selfish, and dishonest.\n\nIt takes a special kind of duplicity to claim that \"saving democracy\" means eliminating the opposition party's ability to compete fairly for representation, or to override the voters' own past verdict in favor of independent redistricting.\n\nNewsom claims he is not canceling the independent commission, but merely setting it aside until the next Census -- or elevating it, pushing for some kind of national independent redistricting commission.\n\nThat is perhaps the biggest lie of all, because he knows he is lying: such a commission would be unconstitutional, since district boundaries are reserved for states. It also has no chance of being accepted by either party.\n\nNewsom's lies are rarely challenged because he avoids opposition media; like the hapless former Rep. Katie Porter, who leads Democrats vying to replace him, he is used to obsequious deference from the press.\n\nProp 50 shows that democracy is in danger in California -- and it is in danger because it has, until now, lacked accountability. This is a low point for the state. But with the California Post, the turnaround begins.",

        "description": "Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis argues the 'number one reason' New Yorkers have left the state and issues a grim warning on 'The Story.'\n\nWith three days until Election Day, and the latest polls pointing to a potential photo finish in the battle for New Jersey governor, the two major party nominees are urging their supporters to get out and vote.\n\n\"When we vote, we win,\" Democratic nominee Rep. Mikie Sherrill told supporters.\n\nAnd her Republican rival, Jack Ciattarelli, told his supporters that \"championship teams finish strong... let's win this race.\"\n\nNew Jersey is just one of two states, along with Virginia, that hold statewide elections for governor this November. And the contests, which traditionally grab outsized national attention, are viewed as crucial early tests of President Donald Trump's unprecedented and explosive second-term agenda, as well as key barometers ahead of next year's midterm showdowns for the U.S. House and Senate.\n\nHEAD HERE FOR THE LATEST FOX NEWS REPORTING ON THE 2025 ELECTIONS\n\nAlso in the political spotlight this November is New York City's high-profile mayoral election, the ballot box proposition over congressional redistricting in California and three state Supreme Court contests in battleground Pennsylvania.\n\nDemocrats, who are aiming to exit the political wilderness following last year's election setbacks when they lost control of the White House and Senate and failed to win back the House majority, are highlighting their success so far this year in special elections.\n\n\"There's wind at our back,\" Democratic National Committee (DNC) Chair Ken Martin recently touted. \"We have overperformed in every single election that's been on the ballot since Donald Trump was inaugurated.\"\n\nONE OF THE TOP 2025 RACES MAY END UP IN A PHOTO FINISH\n\nBut Republicans point to the multitude of problems facing the Democratic Party.\n\n\"Sadly for the DNC, the truth is that Democrats' approval rating is at a 30-year low as the party has hemorrhaged more than 2 million voters over the past four years,\" Republican National Committee communications director Zach Parkinson told Fox News Digital recently.\n\nHere's a closer look at 2025's top elections.\n\nCiattarelli, who's making his third straight run for Garden State governor and who nearly upset Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy four years ago, has good reason to be optimistic he can pull off victory in blue-leaning New Jersey.\n\nIn a state where registered Democrats still outnumber Republicans despite a GOP surge in registration this decade, a recent public opinion poll suggested Ciattarelli narrowing the gap with Sherrill in the race to succeed the term-limited Murphy.\n\nWhile Democrats have long dominated federal and state legislative elections in blue-leaning New Jersey, Republicans are very competitive in gubernatorial contests, winning five out of the past 10 elections.\n\nAnd Trump made major gains in New Jersey in last year's presidential election, losing the state by only six percentage points, a major improvement over his 16-point deficit four years earlier.\n\nTHE POLITICAL BOMB TRUMP EXPLODED IN THE NEW JERSEY SHOWDOWN FOR GOVERNOR\n\nTrump headlined a tele-rally with Ciattarelli a week ago, on the eve of early voting. Trump's teaming up with Ciattarelli may help energize MAGA supporters, many of whom are low propensity voters who often skip casting ballots in non-presidential election years.\n\nThe race in New Jersey was rocked a couple of weeks ago by a report that the National Personnel Records Center, which is a branch of the National Archives and Records Administration, mistakenly released Sherrill's improperly redacted military personnel files, which included private information like her Social Security number, to a Ciattarelli ally.\n\nBut Sherrill's military records indicated that the United States Naval Academy blocked her from taking part in her 1994 graduation amid a cheating scandal.\n\nSherrill, who was never accused of cheating in the scandal, went on to serve nearly a decade in the Navy flying helicopters.\n\nThe showdown was jolted again at last month's final debate after Sherrill's allegations that Ciattarelli was \"complicit\" with pharmaceutical companies in the opioid deaths of tens of thousands of New Jerseyans, as she pointed to the medical publishing company he owned that pushed content promoting the use of opioids as a low-risk treatment for chronic pain.\n\nCLICK HERE TO CHECK OUT THE LATEST FOX NEWS POLLING\n\nAnd Trump recently set off a political hand grenade in the race, as he \"terminated\" billions of federal dollars for the Gateway Project, which is funding a new train tunnel under the Hudson River connecting New Jersey and New York.\n\nSherrill, holding a news conference at a major commuter rail station just a few miles from the site of the tunnels in one of the busiest train corridors in the nation, called the project \"critical\" as she took aim at Trump and Ciattarelli.\n\nExplosive revelations in Virginia's attorney general race that the GOP is aiming to leverage up and down the ballot recently shook up the race for governor, forcing Democratic Party nominee, former Rep. Abigail Spanberger, back on defense in a race where most polls indicated her enjoying a sizable lead over Republican rival Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears.\n\nVirginia attorney general Democratic nominee Jay Jones was in crisis mode after controversial texts were first reported a couple of weeks ago by the National Review.\n\nJones acknowledged and apologized for texts he sent in 2022, when he compared then-Virginia House Speaker Todd Gilbert to mass murderers Adolf Hitler and Pol Pot, adding that if he was given two bullets, he would use both against the GOP lawmaker to shoot him in the head.\n\nBut he faced a chorus of calls from Republicans to drop out of the race.\n\nEarle-Sears hasn't wasted an opportunity to link Spanberger to Jones.\n\nAnd during last month's chaotic and only gubernatorial debate, where Earle-Sears repeatedly interrupted Spanberger, the GOP gubernatorial nominee called on her Democratic rival to tell Jones to end his attorney general bid.\n\nFOR THE LATEST FOX NEWS REPORTING ON THE VIRGINIA SHOWDOWN, HEAD HERE\n\n\"The comments that Jay Jones made are absolutely abhorrent,\" Spanberger said at the debate. But she neither affirmed nor pulled back her support of Jones.\n\nEarle-Sears has kept up the pressure.\n\n\"Abigail Spanberger should have been the first to call for Jay Jones to step down. Instead, she doubled down -- because deep down, she's OK with what he said,\" Earle-Sears argued recently in a social media post.\n\nThe mayoral election in the nation's most populous city always grabs outsized attention, especially this year as New York City may elect its first Muslim and first millennial mayor.\n\nDemocratic socialist 34-year-old state lawmaker Zohran Mamdani's victory in June's Democratic Party mayoral primary sent political shock waves across the country. And he's come under attack from Republicans and from his rivals on the ballot over his far-left proposals.\n\nMamdani is the clear polling and fundraising frontrunner in the heavily blue city as he faces off against former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who came in a distant second in the primary and is now running as an independent candidate. Cuomo is aiming for a political comeback after resigning as governor four years ago amid multiple scandals.\n\nTHE LATEST FOX NEWS REPORTING ON THE NEW YORK CITY MAYORAL ELECTION IS RIGHT HERE\n\nAlso running is two-time Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa, a co-founder of the Guardian Angels, the non-profit, volunteer-based community safety group.\n\nEmbattled Mayor Eric Adams, a Democrat who was running for re-election as an independent, dropped out of the race last month. He recently backed Cuomo, but his name remains on the ballot.\n\nVoters in heavily blue California will vote in November on whether to set aside their popular nonpartisan redistricting commission for the rest of the decade and allow the Democrat-dominated legislature to determine congressional redistricting for the next three election cycles.\n\nThe vote will be the culmination of an effort by Gov. Gavin Newsom and California Democrats to create up to five left-leaning congressional seats in the Golden State to counter the new maps that conservative Gov. Greg Abbott signed into law a couple of months ago, which will create up to five more right-leaning U.S. House districts in the red state of Texas.\n\nThe redistricting in Texas, which came after Trump's urging, is part of a broader effort by the GOP across the country to pad their razor-thin House majority to keep control of the chamber in the 2026 midterms, when the party in power traditionally faces political headwinds and loses seats.\n\nPolls suggest majority support for passage of what's known as Proposition 50.\n\nDemocrats currently hold a 5-2 majority on the Supreme Court in the northeastern battleground of Pennsylvania.\n\nBut three Democrat-leaning justices on the state Supreme Court, following the completion of their 10-year terms, are running this year to keep their seats in \"Yes\" or \"No\" retention elections.\n\nThe election could upend the court's composition for the next decade, heavily influence whether Democrats or Republicans have an advantage in the state's congressional delegation and legislature, and impact crucial cases including voting rights and reproductive rights.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nWhile state Supreme Court elections typically don't grab much national attention, contests where the balance of a court in a key battleground state is up for grabs have attracted tons of outside money.\n\nThe state Supreme Court showdown this spring in Wisconsin, where the 4-3 liberal majority was maintained, drew nearly $100 million in outside money as both parties poured resources into the election.",

        "title": "What's on the ballot in the first general election since Donald Trump became president",
        "description": "WASHINGTON -- One year after Donald Trump retook the White House and set into motion a dramatic expansion of executive power, the Republican president figures prominently in state and local elections being held Tuesday.\n\nThe results of those contests -- the first general election of Trump's second term -- will be heralded by the victors as either a major repudiation or resounding stamp of approval of his second-term agenda. That's especially true in high-profile races for Virginia and New Jersey governor, New York City mayor and a California proposition to redraw its congressional district boundaries.\n\nMore than half of the states will hold contests on Tuesday. Here's a look at some of the major statewide and local races on the ballot:\n\nIn New Jersey, Democrat Mikie Sherrill and Republican Jack Ciattarelli are the nominees to succeed term-limited Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy. Sherrill is a four-term U.S. representative and former Navy helicopter pilot. Ciattarelli is a former state Assemblyman backed by Trump. In 2021, Ciattarelli came within about 3 percentage points of toppling Murphy.\n\nIn Virginia, Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears and Democratic former U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger look to replace term-limited Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin. While Spanberger has made some efforts to focus on topics other than Trump in stump speeches, the president remained a major topic of conversation throughout the campaign, from comments Earle-Sears made about him in 2022 to some of his more polarizing policies, such as the so-called One Big Beautiful Bill tax and spending cut measure and the widespread dismissal of federal workers, many of whom live in northern Virginia.\n\nTrump was scheduled to participate in telephone rallies for the candidates on Monday night.\n\nAs the only gubernatorial races held in the year following a presidential election, the contests have long served as the first major test of voter sentiment toward the party holding the White House. In every race for governor since 1973, one or both states have elected a governor from a party different than that of the sitting president.\n\nThe race to lead the nation's largest city features Democratic state legislator Zohran Mamdani, independent candidate and former Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Republican Curtis Sliwa.\n\nMamdani's comfortable victory over Cuomo in the June primary generated excitement from the party's more progressive wing and apprehension among the party establishment. Party leaders like Gov. Kathy Hochul and U.S. House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries eventually endorsed the self-described democratic socialist months after he won the nomination.\n\nThe winner will replace outgoing Mayor Eric Adams, who initially sought renomination as a Democrat. After losing the primary Adams opted to run as an independent, but dropped out of the race in September and eventually endorsed Cuomo. In February, the Trump Justice Department asked a court to drop corruption charges against Adams because the case impeded Trump's \" immigration objectives.\" Trump later said he'd like to see both Adams and Sliwa drop out of the race in an effort to defeat Mamdani.\n\nCalifornia voters will decide a statewide ballot measure that would enact a new congressional map that could flip as many as five Republican-held U.S. House seats to Democratic control.\n\nProposition 50, championed by Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, is in response to a new Texas map that state Republicans enacted in August as part of Trump's efforts to keep the U.S. House under Republican control in the 2026 midterms. The Texas plan, which could help Republicans flip five Democratic-held U.S. House seats, has sparked an escalating gerrymandering arms race among states to pass new maps outside of the regular once-a-decade schedule.\n\nControl of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court will be at stake when voters cast Yes or No votes on whether to retain three justices from the high court's 5-2 Democratic majority.\n\nPartisan control of the court could have major implications for the 2028 presidential race, since justices might be asked to rule on election disputes, as they did in 2020. Spending on Tuesday's contests is on track to exceed $15 million as Republicans have campaigned to end the majority and Democrats have responded.\n\nIf all three justices are ousted, a deadlock in the confirmation process to replace them could result in a court tied at 2-2. An election to fill any vacant seats for full 10-year terms would be held in 2027.\n\nVIRGINIA ATTORNEY GENERAL: Republican incumbent Jason Miyares seeks a second term against Democrat Jay Jones. Much of the fall campaign has focused on text messages suggesting violence against political rivals that Jones sent in 2022.\n\nTEXAS-18: Sixteen candidates hope to fill a vacant congressional seat previously held by the late Democratic U.S. Rep. Sylvester Turner.\n\nSTATE LEGISLATURES: Control of the Minnesota Senate and Virginia House of Delegates is at stake, while New Jersey Democrats defend their 52-28 General Assembly majority.\n\nBALLOT MEASURES: Maine voters will decide statewide questions on voting and a \"red flag\" law aimed at preventing gun violence. Texas' 17 ballot measures include constitutional amendments on parental rights and limiting voting to U.S. citizens. Colorado and Washington also have statewide measures on the ballot.\n\nFollow the AP's coverage of the 2025 election at https://apnews.com/projects/election-results-2025/.",

        "title": "Gavin's big gamble: The California governor's redistricting battle with Trump sets up 2028",
        "description": "Gov. Gavin Newsom warned that the US may not see a presidential election in 2028, describing authoritarian actions by the Trump administration.\n\nGavin Newsom's 2028 presidential ambitions are about to get a self-imposed stress test after months of putting his political muscle behind one of the Democratic Party's more daring campaigns of 2025.\n\nCalifornia voters are set decide on a Nov. 4 ballot initiative that would radically change how the Golden State's congressional boundaries are drawn.\n\nNewsom is responsible for this rare off-cycle political campaign, setting it up as a heavyweight counterpunch to President Donald Trump, who has arm-twisted Republican-led legislatures from Texas to Indiana to Missouri to redo their own maps ahead of next year's all-important midterms.\n\nMuch more than Democrats potentially winning back control of the U.S. House of Representatives is at stake for the 58-year-old Newsom. The second-term governor has been busy this year trying to distinguish himself from other White House hopefuls with a media blitz and punchy-style online that has mimicked the MAGA leader while standing up against the Trump administration at almost every turn.\n\n\"The meaning of a win in California is huge for Democrats in 2026, and obviously it's a monumental political win for the governor,\" Sean Clegg, a senior Newsom strategist, told USA TODAY in an interview.\n\nNewsom could use the boost as he traverses through a shadow presidential primary that so far lacks a clear favorite on the road to the White House but features prominent figures such as fellow Californian Kamala Harris, the former vice president who is largely absent from the 2025 campaign trail while selling a memoir about her 2024 loss to Trump.\n\nIt's why he is betting that voters will accept Proposition 50, which would allow the state legislature to redo California's 52 congressional districts through 2030 and create as many as five more seats favorable to Democrats before the November 2026 election.\n\nNewsom is spending a significant amount of his political stock to galvanize Democrats, including former President Barack Obama and his likely 2028 rivals, into breaking a long-held orthodoxy against meddling with congressional maps. If successful, Proposition 50 would ditch a nonpartisan commission California voters established via a 2010 ballot initiative that draws those district boundaries.\n\nFor Newsom, it's a move that he believes must be done. While a firm supporter of the independent commission, he and other Democrats cannot wait and hope for the best, according to a confidant close to Newsom who requested anonymity in order to speak freely.\n\nIn interviews, Newsom has talked about his ballot initiative efforts by putting the spotlight on what success this year means: Making next November's midterms a clear referendum for voters as the \"de facto\" end of Trump's presidency.\n\n\"I can't take what's going on. I mean, no bull----. I can't take it,\" Newsom said in an Oct. 25 appearance on the \"All the Smoke\" podcast, hosted by former NBA players Matt Barnes and Stephen Jackson. He added: \"Every single day, every single hour and it's not even about Dems versus Republicans, it's about this country and what we stand for. They're literally putting America in reverse.\"\n\nProposition 50 carries Newsom' 2028 aspirations\n\nNewsom's efforts come with big risks.\n\nThe ballot initiative he's pushing is costing taxpayers a whopping $282.6 million, according to state agencies. If the governor fails or crosses the finish line with lackluster margins, California political experts warn it will drive home many of the negatives attacks rung by opponents that argue Newsom alienates more swing voters than he attracts.\n\n\"If the results are close, that doesn't play well for Gavin Newsom either,\" said Brian Sobel, a longtime political analyst based in the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\n\"Even a low double-digit win, I think that's going to reflect poorly,\" Sobel added. \"But if it's a runaway win, yeah, that's another feather in his cap.\"\n\nMore than the other fall campaigns in Virginia, New Jersey or New York City - all places where Trump also looms - Proposition 50 is an early showcase of one specific Democratic 2028 contender's influence. By all accounts, Newsom appears on the verge of a double-digit victory.\n\nAn Emerson College poll released Oct. 24 showed 57% of likely California voters back Proposition 50 versus 37% who oppose it. An additional 6% remain undecided.\n\nCongressional maps aren't the only place where Newsom has done battle with Trump. The governor has used his megaphone and authority running California to insert himself - and his imminent presidential bid - in almost every debate about the second-term Republican president, filling a void that contrasts with Democrats' being out of power in Washington.\n\nNewsom has filed suits over the president threatening to send National Guard troops into California; combated the administration on imposing foreign tariffs; established climate partnerships at a time when Trump is leaving them; highlighted civil rights; funded reproductive rights; and supplemented food banks amid the ongoing government shutdown.\n\nNewsom's profile has been rising for years. He was included on the short list of presidential candidates in 2022 when Democrats started airing concerns about then-President Joe Biden's ability to run for a second term. At the time, the California governor balked at suggestions he should directly challenge the incumbent president in a primary and instead played a Biden surrogate.\n\nBut when he jousted during a FOX News debate with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who was running for president on the GOP primary side, political observers suggested the pair were who voters really wanted to choose from in 2024.\n\n\"Honestly the country would be incredibly better off if this was our choice,\" Benjamin Domenech, a conservative commentator, said in an October 2023 post on X.\n\nFast forward to 2025 and Newsom's upcoming ballot initiative will be closely watched as a show of his political might much in the same way other would-be contenders, such as Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, who faces a 2026 reelection race that he'll need to win in order to have a chance at 2028.\n\nBesides Obama, who has starred in an ad urging a 'yes' vote on the measure, Newsom is bringing other key figures into the fight. He successfully recruited former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, in addition to Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, of New York, and Sen. Chris Murphy, of Connecticut. Both Ocasio-Cortez and Murphy are seen as possible 2028 Democratic candidates for president.\n\n\"I think every single state that's run by Democrats should be using every amount of leverage they have to play the same game that Republicans are,\" Murphy told USA TODAY. \"We didn't start this, but we can't unilaterally disarm.\"\n\nSources close to Newsom said the governor's push to take the redistricting battle beyond California underscores his ability to bring different factions together. It also helps that other Democrats are following his lead, as more GOP-led states try to redraw their own maps at Trump's urging ahead of the 2026 midterms.\n\nThe Virginia legislature convened this month and passed a measure along partisan lines to redraw its congressional maps via a constitutional amendment that aims to create two or three additional Democratic-held seats. In Illinois, Gov. JB Pritzker, another potential 2028 White House contender, told reporters on Oct. 27 he's having conversations about changing the state's congressional map with legislators.\n\n\"Oh sure, I think it's possible,\" Pritzker said. \"This is all about the fact that Donald Trump is now trying to, well, rig the game.\"\n\nMaryland Gov. Wes Moore, another possible 2028 presidential contender, compared the national fight over congressional district maps to \"political redlining\" and was eager to join the fray. But those plans have been thwarted by one of their own. Democrat Bill Ferguson, the Maryland state Senate president, is against the idea, according to reports.\n\nNaysayers on both sides attack, question Newsom's effectiveness\n\nNewsom's White House ambitions remain just that, for now.\n\nBut the fact he's eyeing a campaign announcement soon after the 2026 midterms results, according to CBS News, sets him up as an architect of the Democratic comeback should his efforts in California help bloom a House majority for his party one year from now.\n\nThe governor's critics are using the costly ballot initiative to poke holes in his growing aura as detractors argue it represents a naked self-centered effort that is more about Newsom's presidential ambitions than protecting democracy.\n\nJessica Millan Patterson, a former California Republican Party chair who leads a \"No on Prop 50\" group backed by the U.S. House GOP, said the state's redistricting panel is popular and should be credited with creating diverse delegations in Sacramento, the state's capital, and Washington.\n\nVoters approved the commission to protect themselves from politicians selecting their own constituents, she said, and they are leaning into that message now with an eye on Democrats, people who have no party preference and also GOP-aligned ones.\n\n\"So to say that this is a power grab, I think, is kind of an understatement,\" Millan Patterson said. \"It is nothing more than a stepping stone for Gavin Newsom to run for president.\"\n\nThis has been an uphill battle for opponents, however, as state data shows the campaign against Proposition 50 has raked in roughly $78 million. Groups supporting the cause have raised $127.5 million.\n\nNewsom holds an overall positive job approval from California voters, according to a CBS News/YouGov poll released in October. It found 53% of approve of his job performance versus 47% who disapprove.\n\nOpposing the governor is a leading reason for Proposition 50 opponents to show up, the survey shows, with 51% saying Newsom is why they're against the initiative.\n\nNewsome's skeptics also include the activist left who aren't sold on him becoming the Democratic face of the party in 2026 and beyond, even as they support combating Trump and the GOP's redistricting efforts.\n\nAdam Green, cofounder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, an influential left-leaning group, said Newsom has not set himself apart as someone average Americans think of as the authentic messenger who connects with a more positive vision for working people.\n\n\"We're living in an outsider moment,\" Green said. \"Today's politics are not about left versus right. They're more accurately about outsider rage versus creatures of the inside.\"\n\nAs much as many Democrats enjoy brawling with Trump, changing congressional maps like Newsom now advocates in the middle of a decade - rather than at a decade's start once new U.S. census data is compiled - does create uneasiness inside the party.\n\nIndependent commissions take the process out of the hands of elected officials, said Sen. Andy Kim, D-New Jersey, who emphasized that he strongly believes in voters choosing who represents them.\n\n\"I don't like any of this, honestly,\" he said.\n\nBut Kim added that he thinks Trump and his GOP allies can't get away with \"blatant cheating\" to keep a majority in Congress.\n\nKentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, who has been making similar pre-2028 presidential pit stops in early states, TV interviews and podcasts, \"wishes Republicans hadn't moved forward with their cynical ploy in Texas,\" a spokesman told USA TODAY.\n\nBeshear acknowledges, however, both parties have to play by the same rules and supports Proposition 50, the spokesman said.\n\nSen. Ruben Gallego, D-Arizona, another rumored 2028 contender, said he has no idea if Proposition 50 prevailing would help out Newsom's presidential efforts. But he said he agreed that Democratic-led states must take action.\n\n\"More importantly, it's going to stop the Republicans from trying to get a permanent majority in this country,\" Gallego told USA TODAY in an interview. \"Again, I wish we could pass anti-gerrymandering legislation, but until then I don't believe in unilateral disarmament.\"\n\nNewsom's office has been working to quell these concerns by spotlighting that a provision under Proposition 50 would return California to a citizen-led redistricting commission process after the 2030 census. They are emphasizing that his political aims include reinvigorating Democrats by building confidence, focusing on local and state elections and developing a clear national message.\n\nBut Newsom himself isn't being shy about those ambitions. One day after Harris teased that she is \"not done\" with public life in an Oct. 25 BBC interview, Newsom yanked the spotlight back, telling \"CBS News Sunday Morning\" during an interview about his many points of opposition to Trump that he'd be \"lying otherwise\" if he didn't admit running for president was on his mind.\n\nContributing: Zachary Schermele, Sarah D.

        "title": "California law seeking to shield Jewish students from antisemitism challenged on free speech grounds",
        "description": "The American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee is challenging a new California law designed to protect Jewish students from discrimination that plaintiff teachers and students say is unconstitutionally vague and violates their free speech rights.\n\nThe federal complaint, filed Sunday in San Jose, seeks to invalidate legislation Gov. Gavin Newsom signed last month creating an Office of Civil Rights to help schools identify and prevent antisemitism. State lawmakers approved the legislation as political tensions have flared in the U.S. over Israel's war in Gaza.\n\nThe new law, which takes effect Jan. 1, doesn't define antisemitism but gives educators the impression that they could be charged with discrimination \"if they expose their students to ideas, information, and instructional materials that may be considered critical of the State of Israel and the philosophy of Zionism,\" according to the complaint.\n\nJenin Younes, national legal director of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, says the lack of guidance has a chilling effect on speech among educators.\n\n\"They censor themselves very broadly because they don't know what's going to get them into trouble,\" she said.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed on behalf of individual teachers and students in California public schools and the Los Angeles Educators for Justice in Palestine.\n\nIn the complaint, middle school science teacher Jonah Olson says students in his rural, largely Christian school district often ask him what it means to be Jewish. He responds in part by saying that his Judaism does not include support for the State of Israel, and now he fears that might violate the law.\n\nParents who are part of the lawsuit say they fear their children will be prevented from learning about differing perspectives on Israel, Palestine and the Middle East.\n\nStudents in public schools nationwide are generally protected against discrimination through state, federal and district policies, but supporters of the law say they needed to do more given a surge in harassment and bullying of Jewish and Israeli students.\n\nThe Anti-Defamation League, which supports the new law, said 860 antisemitic acts such as harassment, vandalism and assault were reported to the group last year at non-Jewish K-12 schools nationwide. The number is a 26% decrease from the previous year but much higher than the 494 reported in 2022.",

        "title": "Opinion | Why DOJ election monitors in California and New Jersey are setting off alarms",
        "description": "California prepares for Trump 'election watchers': 'We will be making sure they stay in their lane'\n\nThe Department of Justice will deploy federal election observers to monitor sites in Tuesday's elections in California and New Jersey. This would usually be seen as a routine mission from the department's Civil Rights Division, which is tasked with ensuring federal election laws are followed across the country. But the precise areas of deployment, the absence of clear federal authority to oversee these specific races and the questionable pretext for their deployment all set a disturbing precedent that will likely expand during next year's midterm elections.\n\nIn late October, Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement that the election monitors are necessary \"to ensure the American people get the fair, free, and transparent elections they deserve.\" The Justice Department staffers in question will be headed to five counties in California, including Los Angeles County, and one county in New Jersey. According to the DOJ's release, the staffers will facilitate \"an open flow of communication between poll observers and election monitors to ensure that elections proceed with a high degree of security.\"\n\nBut under the Constitution, states are charged with conducting elections, with federal laws only rarely superseding that authority. The two states where DOJ observers will be present don't have elections with any federal component that would invite Bondi's intervention. California voters will decide whether to amend the state's constitution to shift control over congressional redistricting away from an independent commission and back to the state legislature. The move from Gov. Gavin Newsom comes in response to a White House-backed pro-GOP gerrymander in Texas earlier this year. While there are federal implications, it's still a statewide election. Meanwhile, New Jersey is holding state legislative and gubernatorial elections. In the latter, Democratic nominee Mikie Sherrill leads Republican Jack Ciattarelli in the mid-single digits in polling averages, but some surveys show a closer race.\n\nInstead, the Justice Department chose to involve itself in the proceedings only after a request from each state's Republican Party. The New Jersey GOP requested that DOJ staffers be present in Passaic County to \"oversee the receipt and processing of vote-by-mail ballots\" and \"take steps to monitor access to the Board of Elections around the clock.\" In the letter to Harmeet Dhillon, head of the DOJ's Civil Rights Division, the New Jersey GOP claimed this was necessary because of a \"long sordid history of [vote-by-mail] fraud,\" referring to an ongoing fraud case in a 2020 city council race. It's worth noting that Passaic County was a former Democratic stronghold that swung to Trump in 2024 -- and is home to a sizeable Latino community -- making it potentially crucial to Ciattarelli's victory.\n\nSimilarly, according to NBC affiliate KCRA, California GOP chairwoman Corrin Rankin wrote in a letter to Dhillon expressing concerns Orange and Los Angeles Counties that \"arise from their voter list maintenance practices -- Orange County is currently in litigation with the Department of Justice over its voter list and there are questions about the accuracy of the voter rolls in Los Angeles County, as well as that county's compliance with a settlement reached with Judicial Watch.\"\n\nThe ongoing litigation that Rankin referred to is being waged across the country after a demand from Bondi for states to turn over sensitive voter information including driver's license numbers and partial Social Security numbers. Among the six states facing Justice Department lawsuits is Pennsylvania; its Republican secretary of state, Al Schmidt, called the lawsuit \"unprecedented and unlawful\" and promised to \"vigorously fight the federal government's overreach in court.\"\n\nAs The Associated Press reported, the sudden interest in these specific off-season elections has experts skeptical about the Justice Department's decision and the effect of the monitors:\n\nIt's also true that the laws allowing federal election observers to be deployed at all are limited to ensuring anti-discrimination laws are upheld. And even then, the deployment must take place under a court order, which the administration lacks in both New Jersey and California.\n\nBut with Bondi and Dhillon running the show at the Justice Department under President Donald Trump, the usual rules may not apply. After all, working within the exact spirit of the law, let alone the letter, hasn't been this administration's preferred approach. Here, Bondi and Dhillon are following Trump's marching orders in his war on early voting and mail-in ballots. That will likely set up a clash with state election officials, especially when you consider that more than 80% of Californians voted by mail in 2024.\n\nCrucially, Dhillon has worked to invert the Civil Rights Division's priorities from ensuring access to the polls to using it as a tool that could hinder certain undesirable voters from casting ballots. The department's suggestion that the monitors will be working closely with poll observers recalls the army of GOP observers trained last year to add weight to Trump's frequent (and unproven) claims of voter fraud. And as my colleague Steve Benen noted last week, there's plenty of evidence that the MAGA acolytes are gearing up to be even more aggressive during the midterms.\n\nThe slew of election deniers now being put in place in key roles around the country, paired with the Justice Department's groundwork to suggest fraud without evidence, portends a much more fraught election experience this time next year. The federal election monitors on the ground in California and New Jersey likely will not affect the results of Tuesday's contests. But their presence both telegraphs a political message -- a show of force to rally their supporters and cow their opponents -- and could be used as justification for more overt intimidation in future elections.",

        "title": "Republicans encourage voters to cast mail ballots, despite Trump's attacks",
        "description": "Republican activists are trying to rally voters behind the practice.\n\nWhen President Donald Trump wrote on social media in August that there should be \"no mail-in voting\" and that Americans should \"USE PAPER BALLOTS ONLY,\" he appeared to contradict the efforts of Republican officials and activists across the country who have spent the last several years encouraging Republicans to embrace absentee voting.\n\nTrump's post echoed what had become nearly universal messaging among party members after the 2020 election, when he sought, baselessly, to blame his loss that year to the pandemic-related spike in mail-in voting.\n\nBut since then, many Republicans, including some who had been the most avid opponents of absentee voting, have said they recognize that the practice is necessary to win elections.\n\nPennsylvania state Sen. Doug Mastriano, who wove repeated criticisms of absentee voting into his unsuccessful gubernatorial campaign in 2022, acknowledged to Politico a year later that Republicans \"have to embrace no-excuse mail-in voting.\"\n\nThis fall, with voters deciding whether to retain three Democrats on the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, the state Republican Party has encouraged voters to request an absentee ballot.\n\n\"If there is even a 1% chance that you might miss the 2025 Election, sign up for a mail-in ballot today! It's quick and easy!\" the state party's X account posted recently.\n\nPennsylvania election data shows that in the 2024 presidential election, Republicans accounted for 34% of the total votes by mail, up from 23% in the 2020 race.\n\nJim Worthington, a business owner and Republican fundraiser in eastern Pennsylvania, has encouraged Republican candidates in the state to develop a robust vote-by-mail operation, warning them that not doing so could cost them an election.\n\nWorthington told ABC News that when Dave McCormick approached him for his support when he ran for Senate in 2024, Worthington told him that he \"would support him if he came up with a robust, paid-for vote-by-mail program, which he agreed he would.\"\n\nWorthington said the ensuing effort, which he said raised $13 million to support vote-by-mail, was \"one of the reasons he won, and it certainly helped [Trump].\"\n\nRepublicans in other states with off-year races this fall have been pushing vote-by-mail.\n\nJack Ciattarelli, the Republican candidate for New Jersey governor, touted in an interview with Fox News, \"We've had more Republicans return vote-by-mail ballots than ever before.\"\n\nThe California Republican Party has told voters on X, \"Don't wait until the November 4th deadline, MAIL IN YOUR NO ON PROP 50 BALLOT TODAY,\" referencing the ballot measure proposed by Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom that would redraw the state's congressional districts.\n\nSome experts cautioned, however, that Trump's warnings against mail-in voting could hinder the efforts by party members to push the practice.\n\n\"The Republicans have a two-fold problem. Number one, the base of the party only comes out when Trump is on the ballot. And number two, he's still telling people, don't use mail in ballots,\" Philadelphia-based public affairs executive Larry Ceisler told ABC News. \"So I don't know how they deal with that.\"\n\nThe White House did not respond to ABC News' request for comment.\n\n\"No mail-in or 'Early' Voting, Yes to Voter ID!\" Trump said last week in a social media post.\n\nWorthington said the rhetoric by Republicans in Pennsylvania is helpful, but limited in its effectiveness. Republicans must also convince low-propensity voters to vote by mail, he said.\n\n\"They require people knocking on their doors, going to them, following up, at least three or four visits, minimum, where you've got to continue to go back to them,\" he told ABC News.\n\nEfforts to boost mail voting by Republicans for next year's midterm elections must start soon, he warned.\n\n\"You just can't roll out a vote by mail program that's next spring and think you're going to make a big enough dent to get those numbers to where they need to be,\" Worthington said.",

        "title": "Analysis | Where are we on redistricting?",
        "description": "In today's edition ... The Trump administration faces a court order on SNAP ... You tell us your thoughts on nuclear testing ... but first ...\n\nWhere are we on redistricting?\n\nCalifornia voters head to the polls tomorrow to vote on Proposition 50, the extremely high-profile, aggressive push by Democrats to redraw the state's congressional maps. If voters okay the proposition, California Democrats could gain five new House seats.\n\nThe measure is a direct response to the Texas Legislature creating five more safe Republican seats to help protect President Donald Trump's party from losing the House majority next year.\n\nWhile the fight over Texas redistricting included a dramatic flight from the state by Democratic lawmakers amid threats of arrest and fines, the California measure appears on a much smoother path to passing.\n\nProponents of Prop 50 have vastly out-raised opponents, to the point where Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom asked donors to direct their dollars elsewhere. Republicans have largely stopped airing ads or fundraising in opposition to the measure, with Trump's campaign team concerned about draining money on a cause that appears lost, Hannah Knowles and Emily Davies reported.\n\nDespite early concerns among some Democrats that the measure betrays the party's principles, the party has rallied behind the cause, with leaders -- including former president Barack Obama and former vice president Kamala Harris -- campaigning for it.\n\n\"We are prepared, when necessary, to fight fire with fire,\" Harris said at a Los Angeles rally on Saturday that included other high profile Democrats like Newsom, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (Minnesota), Sen. Adam Schiff (California), Sen. Alex Padilla (California), Rep. Judy Chu (California), Rep. Jasmine Crockett (Texas) and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass.\n\nDespite Democrats' financial advantage, opponents of the proposition, who argue it is undemocratic and a flagrant dismissal of the state's bipartisan redistricting commission, assert that there is still a chance of beating it.\n\n\"While we are being significantly outspent, there are still millions of votes to be submitted, and the campaign will focus on communicating to persuadable voters and turning out supporters,\" Amy Thoma Tan, a spokeswoman for a committee opposed to Prop 50, told our colleague Maeve Reston.\n\nMid-decade redistricting has already expanded far beyond California and Texas. Missouri and North Carolina both used legislative action to each create one more Republican-leaning district. Indiana's General Assembly will meet for a special session today at the behest of Republican Gov. Mike Braun to draw new congressional districts, though the several state Republicans have been hesitant about backing the effort.\n\nOhio, as mandated by its state constitution, had to redraw districts this year. Its bipartisan commission created a map with two districts that lean further Republican -- one of which already leans Republican but is currently represented by Democratic Rep. Marcy Kaptur. The state adopted the map on Friday; Democrats accepted the map as others under consideration would have made for less competitive races.\n\nRepublicans in Kansas, Florida and New Hampshire are also agitating for new maps that would benefit their party.\n\nOn the Democratic side, lawmakers in Illinois, Maryland and Virginia have all have floated ideas for new maps to boost the number of Democratic seats. Virginia is the furthest along: Lawmakers there gathered for a special session to put their redistricting push in motion in time to affect next year's midterms.\n\nVirginia's Senate approved a constitutional amendment on Friday to allow the General Assembly to redraw congressional districts outside of the usual decennial bipartisan commission. The House approved the amendment earlier last week. Virginia's General Assembly has to approve the amendment again during its next session beginning early next year and voters will need to sign off on the redistricting plan in a statewide referendum. Virginia's governor and other statewide offices, as well as its House, are both up for election tomorrow.\n\n\"We only find ourselves in this position because Republicans know their agenda of raising costs, gutting American's health care, and stealing food from working families is disastrous,\" Courtney Rice, a spokesperson for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said in a statement of Virginia's redistricting push. \"The DCCC is thankful to Virginia's Democratic leadership and legislators for acting with swiftness, clarity, and resolve in this matter.\"\n\nMaryland has only one Republican district, represented by Rep. Andy Harris, a deeply conservative member who chairs the House Freedom Caucus. But many prominent state Democrats are skeptical about unseating him.\n\nBill Ferguson, the Democratic president of the Maryland Senate, warned redistricting would jeopardize his party by making Democratic seats in Maryland more vulnerable, and that any map that wiped out Republican-leaning districts would be open to court challenges. Maryland's legislature drew districts in 2021 that were later struck down by the state's Supreme Court as a partisan gerrymander.\n\n\"When we analyze where things are, it is more likely that in Maryland, if we move forward with this, that we would lose representation and not gain,\" Ferguson said in an interview with Fox 5 Washington DC. \"It's not hypothetical. ... We tried to do this in 2021.\"\n\nAndy Harris said in a statement that a redistricting push would blow back on Democrats, highlighting \"just how unfair and politically motivated Maryland's district lines have been for years.\"\n\n\"It seems that at least some of Maryland's Democrats have finally realized the inevitable -- the state's current congressional map is already gerrymandered to their advantage, and any mid-decade redistricting would only expose that fact further, and open the potential for a court-imposed nonpartisan map that could result in two or even three Republicans being elected,\" Andy Harris said.\n\nDuring the Saturday rally, Kamala Harris told supporters that other states would be impacted by the path California chooses during tomorrow's vote -- and called on other Democratic states to redistrict.\n\n\"People are watching what is happening here right now,\" Harris said. \"Other states need to step up, too.\"\n\nGet ready with The Post\n\nWhat we're watching\n\nFederal judges in Massachusetts and Rhode Island ordered the Trump administration to disburse SNAP benefits. But will they go out?\n\nThe administration has to report to both courts today on whether and how it plans to release funds for SNAP, the nutrition assistance program formerly known as food stamps.\n\nRoughly an eighth of Americans need the program to feed themselves and their families; benefits that were scheduled to begin going out on Saturday were paused due to the government shutdown.\n\nThe Trump administration claims it doesn't have the legal authority to make November SNAP payments with the government closed. The judges, however, asserted that the shutdown constitutes the kind of extraordinary circumstances that contingency funds held by the Agriculture Department are meant to cover.\n\nDespite the orders, the administration isn't making any promises. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins called it a \"lie\" that the department can unleash the funds, asserting Friday before the court orders that the contingency fund is only allowed to be used if the underlying program is funded through appropriations. She said Friday that \"we're looking at all the options\" in the event a judge ordered her to release the funds.\n\nTrump posted on Truth Social that the administration's lawyers \"do not think we have the legal authority to pay SNAP with certain monies we have available,\" but that he \"instructed our lawyers to ask the Court to clarify how we can legally fund SNAP as soon as possible.\" He said the cleanest solution was for Democrats to vote for the Republican government funding package and reopen the government.\n\n\"If we are given the appropriate legal direction by the Court, it will BE MY HONOR to provide the funding, just like I did with Military and Law Enforcement Pay,\" Trump wrote. \"The Democrats should quit this charade where they hurt people for their own political reasons, and immediately REOPEN THE GOVERNMENT.\"\n\nTrump recently called on Senate Republicans to abolish the filibuster to push the GOP's funding plan through. Doing so would be an enormous blow to a norm that has defined the Senate for years. It's not the first time Trump has asked the Senate to do so, but Republican leadership have consistently defended the filibuster.\n\nIn your local paper\n\nThe Spokesman-Review (Spokane, Washington): Cattle ranchers saw prices tank after Trump announced he would allow more Argentine beef on the U.S. market, angering ranchers who already have to navigate a challenging industry.\n\nFort Worth Report: A North Texas state Senate race is drawing millions of dollars from some of the biggest donors in the state, pitting a MAGA-aligned, Trump-endorsed Republican against a conservative backed by pro-gambling money.\n\nTimes of San Diego: Military bands scheduled to perform at a Fleet Week concert had to cancel due to the government shutdown.\n\nFrom you\n\nWe had a lot of visceral responses to Trump's announcement that the U.S. would resume nuclear testing. His announcement caused a lot of confusion -- will there be detonations? How will our adversaries respond? Energy Secretary Chris Wright clarified some of the ambiguity around Trump's statement, saying he did not expect actual warhead tests and detonations for now.\n\nMany of you wrote to us about your memories of the nuclear blast drills of the Cold War.\n\n\"I had a flashback. I remember hiding under a desk thinking we would be safe,\" Jeff Jensen wrote. \"Just the thought that this is starting again, is horrifying. To think my grandchildren will be living with the same fear is overwhelming.\"\n\nMary Ciriello said the drills, which felt useless at the time, would be an unneeded added stressor on children today.\n\n\"Nowadays everyone is completely stressed out, especially children. That this administration would even consider nuclear testing is abhorrent and dangerous, not to mention expensive,\" Ciriello wrote. \"Let's prioritize healthcare and feeding the hungry.\"\n\nBruce Lampe dismissed the nuclear tests as \"saber rattling theater,\" noting that the country is not at war with a nuclear power. Joanne Minuete said she could \"maybe\" understand if \"there are new designs that absolutely need testing,\" but did not agree with moves \"to show off just to let others know our capabilities.\"\n\nPatty Bodin, who previously worked in nuclear weapons testing with the federal government including during the final underground nuclear test in 1992, said the country has since \"developed sophisticated techniques for conducting subcritical nuclear experiments in order to gain the necessary information about the nuclear stockpile,\" rendering the sort of tests Trump appeared to suggest unnecessary.\n\n\"Given the enormous costs associated with actual nuclear tests I think it would be misguided to resume testing,\" Bodin wrote. \"It would take years to assemble the requisite cadre, perform necessary safety analyses and gain buy-in from the state of Nevada not to mention the implications for the world wide moratorium.\"\n\nSend us a reply\n\nOur colleagues Marianne LeVine and Robert Klemko recently wrote about the controversy over using inordinate amounts of tear gas to disperse protesters. What do you think? What is the barrier between what are acceptable and unacceptable use-of-force tactics for policing?

        "title": "What to know about California's Proposition 50  --  Gavin Newsom's...",
        "description": "That will be the question facing Californians on Tuesday in a special election that could reshape the balance of power in the state and the country for years to come.\n\nProposition 50, backed by Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom, would temporarily redraw the state's electoral maps in a way that could help Democrats flip five Congressional seats in the 2026 midterms.\n\nThe new maps were hastily hashed out in August in response to a similar redistricting scheme in Texas designed to hand more seats to the Republicans. It's a fight-fire-with-fire strategy meant to balance the scales in Washington.\n\nAs it currently stands, a bipartisan commission is in charge of California's maps, not the state's Democratic legislature. Prop 50 would give the legislature power to impose its own electoral maps for the 2026, 2028, and 2030 elections.\n\nNewsom and his supporters are pretty transparent about their motives. The ballot item clearly states that Prop 50 \"authorizes temporary changes to congressional district maps in response to Texas' partisan redistricting.\"\n\nThe question is whether left-leaning Californians are willing to try and out-gerrymander the gerrymanderers.\n\nProp 50 is a smoking hot item in California politics right now, with supporters and detractors bombarding voters with TV ads, billboards, and leaflets stuffed in their mailboxes.\n\nAn initial controversy surrounded whether to hold the special election at all, which Republicans in the State Assembly estimated would cost an already cash-strapped California more than $200 million.\n\nAs for Prop 50 itself: California voters typically despise gerrymandering. They voted to establish the independent body -- the California Citizens Redistricting Commission (CRC) -- that draws electoral maps in the late 00s amid a frenzy of anti-gerrymandering sentiment.\n\nNow many of those same voters feel they're being offered a deal with the Devil.\n\nProponents describe Prop 50 as a referendum on Trump's dominion over Congress.\n\nTexas' redistricting bill -- drawn up at Trump's request and passed in August -- was designed to add at least five House seats to Republicans, which could dash Democrats' hopes of taking back the House.\n\nAs for the ethics of it: Turnabouts is fair play, supporters say, and it isn't like they're being sneaky about their motives. In fact, Newsom has gone so far as to call Prop 50 \"the most transparent and democratic redistricting that's ever been done in the United States of America.\"\n\nBut beating Republicans at their own game could undermine the independent redistricting system Californians fought for.\n\nDetractors include former governor Arnold Swartzenegger, who presided over the formation of the CRC. He condemned Democrats' effort to \"out-cheat\" their opponents in an interview with CNN.\n\nVery high.\n\nFifty-six percent of likely voters said they would vote \"yes\" on Prop 50, in a survey conducted earlier this month by the University of California Berkeley. Forty-three percent said they would vote \"no,\" with 1 percent undecided.\n\nAnother survey by the Emerson College Polling Center had a nearly identical result, and another poll by CBS News put support for Prop 50 at 62%.\n\nIn the CBS poll, an overwhelming number of Prop 50 supporters said they were voting \"yes\" specifically to oppose the Trump Administration and national Republicans.\n\nThe new electoral map prunes out conservative-leaning districts in the north and far south of the state, leaving a three-district Republican stronghold in the southeast, along the Nevada border.\n\nWhether the new map unfairly divides communities and demographics depends on whom you ask, with both sides arguing that theirs is the fairest.\n\nA statement from the Vote NO on Prop 50 campaign claims the new map splinters \"many Latino, Asian and Black communities who fought to stay unified in the same district,\" but an analysis by the Public Policy Institute of California found that both maps are more or less the same when it comes to preserving minority power bases.\n\nAs previously mentioned, former Governor Schwarzenegger wants to terminate the measure, calling it a tragic step backwards for the independent redistricting movement his state helped pioneer.\n\nFormer President Barack Obama endorsed Prop 50 at a virtual event with Gavin Newsom.\n\n\"There is a broader principle at stake that has to do with whether or not our democracy can be manipulated by those who are already in power,\" Obama said in a quote reported by the Washington Post.\n\nOther supporters include Representatives Nancy Pelosi and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and senators Alex Padilla and Adam Schiff.\n\nBut seven of the 15 members of the CRC itself oppose Orop 50, according to local KCRA 3, including the Committee's leader Neal Fornaciari.",

        "title": "A clear trail of clues betrays Trump's ultimate plot",
        "description": "Donald Trump signs a print of a TIME cover, during a White House event. REUTERS/Kylie Cooper\n\nWill the 2028 election even happen, or are we watching the slow-motion rehearsal for its cancellation? Every signal from Trump's orbit points to a deliberate strategy to turn fear, chaos, and manufactured crisis into political weapons.\n\nHistory tells us how these stories end. From John Adams jailing his critics under the Alien and Sedition Acts to Richard Nixon's troops gunning down students at Kent State to crackdowns by Viktor Orb\u00e1n and Vladimir Putin, authoritarians have always wrapped repression in the language of patriotism.\n\nToday, with talk of \"domestic enemies,\" \"rapid reaction forces,\" and \"nuclear demonstrations,\" the groundwork is being laid again, not to protect America, but to control it.\n\nWhy is it that dictators and wannabe dictators -- both historic and now Trump -- always attack their own countries' people while saber-rattling about war against other countries?\n\nBack in 1964, Americans were worried that Barry Goldwater -- with all his anti-communist rhetoric -- might start a nuclear war with the USSR. Lyndon Johnson exploited that with his famous \"Daisy\" advertisement, where a little girl plucked petals off a flower as the countdown to a nuclear bomb sounded in the background. In the end, over video of a nuclear bomb going off, Johnson's voice said:\n\n\"These are the stakes: to make a world in which all of God's children can live, or go into the darkness. We must love each other, or we must die.\"\n\nThe ad ended with \"Vote for President Johnson on November 3rd. The stakes are too high for you to stay home.\" It only ran once, but had such an impact that it turned the election and kept Johnson in office.\n\nWhen I was a child we had \"duck and cover\" under our desks in elementary school, and lived in fear of nuclear war. My dad seriously considered building a fallout shelter in our basement; his concern wasn't outside the mainstream.\n\nWhen Ronald Reagan ran for president, people called him \"Ronnie Ray Gun\" because he was widely seen as the trigger-happy cowboy who might start the next world war. He reminded us of characters in the Dr. Strangelove movie.\n\nMany folks also worried that both Goldwater and Reagan might use the intelligence and military services of America to go after their \"socialist\" enemies in America. Those old enough to remember can tell you how, on May 1, 1970, California Governor Ronald Reagan called students protesting the Vietnam war across America \"brats,\" \"freaks\" and \"cowardly fascists,\" and added, as The New York Times noted at the time:\n\n\"If it takes a bloodbath, let's get it over with. No more appeasement!\"\n\nThree days later, on May 4, 1970, Reagan got his bloodbath at Kent State University when 28 National Guard soldiers opened fire with live ammunition on an estimated 3,000 student protestors.\n\nOver a mere 13 seconds, nearly 70 shots were fired. Jeffrey Miller, Allison Krause, William Schroeder and Sandra Scheuer were killed, and nine others were wounded. Schroeder was shot in the back, as were several of those injured.\n\nTrump, it appears, intends to out-Goldwater and out-Reagan both of those two old cold warriors and take us fully into Putin-style leadership territory.\n\nPentagon readying thousands of 'reaction forces' as DOMESTIC missions widen...\n\nTroops across country being trained for civil unrest...\n\nTop White House Officials Moving Onto Military Bases...\n\nThe Don Swaps Decorated Admiral With 33-Year-Old DOGE staffer...\n\nDOD can't say who it killed in military strikes against 'drug smugglers'...\n\nDems excluded from briefing...\n\nWednesday, Trump told reporters that he's ordering his military to prepare for demonstration explosions of American nuclear weapons. (\"Tests\" is an euphemism; there's no doubt our bombs work just fine. Exploding them is more appropriately called a \"threat.\")\n\nLater in the day we learned that he's ordered all 50 state national guards to prepare \"rapid reaction forces,\" not to fight a foreign enemy but to turn their tanks, drones, and automatic weapons of war on Americans who dissent from Trump's coming crackdowns on \"the enemy within.\"\n\nI've written before about how in 1798 Federalist President Adams used the Alien and Sedition Acts -- precursors to the Insurrection Act that came a decade later -- to shut down the nation's roughly 20 Jefferson-aligned Democratic newspapers and imprison anybody who spoke out against him (including Newark's town drunk, Luther Baldwin).\n\nWhen Jefferson became president in 1801 he let most of Adams' Alien and Sedition Acts expire, but today Trump appears hell-bent on reviving and invoking the Insurrection Act of 1807 that replaced them.\n\nIt appears that Trump's plan to either sabotage or completely suspend the election of 2028 (with 2026 as a testing ground) is straightforward, a play in three acts.\n\nFirst, he's having his ICE and CPB people engage in as provocative behavior as possible, trying to produce a violent response from the citizens of Chicago or any other city where they can pull it off.\n\nThe apparent reason for this and his many lies about cities in flames and chaos is because he wants an excuse to declare an insurrection, invoke the Insurrection Act, and either lock down or suspend altogether for the duration of the \"emergency\" the next presidential elections in 2028.\n\nSteve Bannon is already claiming Trump will be president in 2029; Governors JB Pritzker and Gavin Newsom have both specifically referenced this possibility.\n\nAnd it appears the corrupt Republicans on the Supreme Court may be planning to help him out with his project of using the military to end democracy in America. There's now a debate about whether the phrase \"regular forces\" in the law Trump's using to deploy troops includes ICE, local/state police, federal police agencies like the FBI, or military forces. The Court has asked for further arguments from both sides on the issue, with filings completed by Nov. 10th.\n\nSecond, once Trump's thugs have stirred up enough opposition in the streets of one or more major cities to justify it, he'll then drop the hammer with troops in a way that may well make Kent State look like a high school play.\n\nThe resulting violence and chaos will give him the excuse he needs to invoke the Insurrection Act of 1807, something he has repeatedly referenced in the past few months.\n\nThird, with the authority of the Supreme Court and the Insurrection Act behind him, he'll suspend the elections \"until the present emergency subsides\" and essentially declare himself king for life.\n\nAnd now he's ordered his so-called Department of War to begin testing nuclear weapons. He's not only trying to lock down America and turn us into a dictatorship, but he clearly has serious plans to use the threat of nuclear war to further solidify his hold over America; presidents during or on the edge of a time of war have extraordinary emergency powers.\n\nJust ask the descendants of Eugene V. Debs, who President Woodrow Wilson threw into prison for opposing World War I (then called \"the Great War\") and who then ran for president from his jail cell.\n\nThe question then becomes: \"Who will he choose as America's allies?\"\n\nWill it be Europe, Ukraine, Australia, and the democracies of Asia (Taiwan, Japan, South Korea)? Or will it be the authoritarian and nearly-authoritarian regimes of China, India, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Qatar, Russia, and Israel?\n\nIs Trump leading America into a new Allies vs Axis conflict where the \"allies\" are the countries run by authoritarians who praise and fund him and his family? If so, is there any doubt he'll replicate their domestic strategies for political repression and holding power? He's already echoing Putin's rhetoric about the \"lying press\" and \"the enemy within.\"\n\nIs there any part of Trump's behavior that we've seen in the last decade that causes us to think he might join with France or Ukraine instead of with Putin or Xi, if given the chance? Just ask Volodymir Zelenskyy or Taiwan's people about that.\n\nAdding a final touch, Trump announced this week that he's ordering the National Guard to create \"Quick Reaction Forces\" in all 50 states specifically to deal with domestic unrest.\n\nHe apparently wants a dozen violent Kent State-type events that he can use as an excuse to militarize the entire country, and a shocking number of elected Republicans and rightwing media celebrities are explicitly cheering on such an authoritarian crackdown.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Newsom is telling anybody who will listen that the 2028 presidential election will be a \"Putin [style] election\" if Democrats don't \"stand up\" and fight back now to block Trump's plans to militarize the country and declare an insurrection.\n\n\"I'll tell you what,\" Newsom told ABC News's Jonathan Karl in an interview Wednesday, \"we won't have a country. We won't have an election that's fair and free if we don't stand up, we won't. There will not be a fair and free election -- it'll be a Putin election.\"\n\nTrump appears well aware of his weakness, his collapsing poll numbers, and the precipice the American economy is teetering at the edge of. He sees the same disaster coming in next week's elections -- and its presaging the GOP's 2028 losses -- just as clearly as the rest of us do.\n\nAnd it appears that he has a plan to deal with it, a plan that takes John Adams' imprisoning newspaper editors, Nixon's Kent State massacre, and LBJ's Vietnam War up to such Putin-like levels of intimidation, repression, and violence that the 2028 elections are at risk.",

        "title": "Elections Across the U.S. Will Test Democrats' Momentum Ahead of 2026 Midterms",
        "description": "After more than nine months of President Trump using the full force of the federal government to impose his will on the nation, elections across the country on Tuesday will offer the Democratic Party its biggest chance yet to assert its viability as a serious opposition party.\n\nNo federal contests that could provide a meaningful check on Mr. Trump's powers in Washington will be decided. But races for governor in New Jersey and Virginia headline an Election Day that will provide a critical update on the state of the Democrats' rebuilding project and a preview of the fault lines in the 2026 midterm elections.\n\nThe 2025 races have been buffeted by many of the same forces that shaped the 2024 race, led by an affordability crisis that is pinching voters in cities, suburbs and rural areas alike. Unlike in the 2024 election, it is now Mr. Trump and his ambitious regime of tariffs that are seen as driving the economy.\n\nKen Martin, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, predicted in an interview that victories on Tuesday would help his party head into 2026 with \"a head full of steam.\"\n\n\"Where there were once strong headwinds against the Democratic Party, there now seems to be wind at our back and momentum for sure,\" Mr. Martin said. He insisted, \"it's not just an anti-Trump wave that we're seeing,\" but a powerful chord that Democrats have struck with their message on economics and affordability.\n\nOf course, its helps Democrats that the biggest contests are being held in states that Mr. Trump lost. The flip side is that any defeats in those states could be especially deflating.\n\nBeyond the governors' races, mayoral contests in New York, Minneapolis and Seattle will highlight generational and ideological divides in the Democratic Party. Supreme Court elections in Pennsylvania, a key swing state, offer a check on the main parties' strength. Races farther down the ticket -- state legislative showdowns in Mississippi, a close attorney general contest in Virginia, two seats on Georgia's public service commission, even a City Council recall in Mesa, Ariz. -- will offer glimpses at the state of both parties in a time of division and rancor.\n\nIn New York City, the rise of 34-year-old Zohran Mamdani, the democratic socialist who polls show is favored to win the mayor's race, has demonstrated the left's appetite to inject fresh faces and new ideas into the fight. Mr. Mamdani faces a November rematch with former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who is running as an independent after Mr. Mamdani's victory in the Democratic primary.\n\nOther consequential contests include a California ballot measure to redraw the state's congressional lines. The measure could squeeze as many as five House Republicans out of their seats and fortify a half-dozen Democratic incumbents in an effort to offset redistricting gambits by Republicans in Texas, North Carolina, Missouri and potentially more states.\n\nRepublicans hold a three-seat majority in the House headed into the 2026 midterm elections, magnifying the importance of each seat carved off the battleground landscape by partisan mapmakers.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom of California, the architect of the state's proposed new maps, held a bullish final rally in Los Angeles on Saturday, predicting Tuesday would be the beginning of a Democratic comeback.\n\n\"What this is all about is Democrats getting back on our toes -- not our heels -- getting our mojo back,\" Mr. Newsom said at the event, where former Vice President Kamala Harris also appeared. \"I cannot wait for Nov. 5, Nov. 6 and all the punditry.\"\n\nThe body language from top Republicans was far less optimistic. Mr. Trump himself has done little campaigning, including in the final weekend. He has held no big rallies, instead speaking at recent telephone rallies aimed at New Jersey and Virginia voters.\n\nMr. Trump's Justice Department has announced plans to send officials to \"monitor polling sites\" in six California and New Jersey counties, a tactic that Mr. Newsom has called an effort at voter intimidation and suppression -- and even a pretext to later make false claims of fraud.\n\nThe elections are also unfolding against the unusual backdrop of the federal government shutdown, which will rank as the longest in American history by the time the polls close on Tuesday. Mr. Trump and congressional Democrats have barely engaged in negotiations, each side hoping a protracted fight will inflict more damage to the other.\n\nThe fall's most contested and costly race -- with more than $200 million in advertising -- is for New Jersey's governorship. Jack Ciattarelli, the Republican nominee, is making his third run in a row for the seat, after narrowly losing four years ago to Gov. Philip D. Murphy, a Democrat. He is urging voters to \"elect a Jersey guy\" and pressing to replicate Mr. Trump's strong showing in the state's Black and Latino communities.\n\nRepresentative Mikie Sherrill, who is the Democratic nominee and a former Navy pilot, has promised to declare a Day 1 emergency to address rising utility costs in the state and blames Mr. Trump for the high cost of living. Mr. Ciattarelli, in turn, has blamed Mr. Murphy and Democrats who dominate the statehouse for the state's struggles.\n\nTwo historical and countervailing trends are converging in New Jersey.\n\nIf Ms. Sherrill were to win, it would be the first time the state's voters have elected governors from the same party for three consecutive terms since the 1960s. At the same time, the state has often selected a new governor who counterbalances the party that occupies the White House, including both Mr. Murphy during Mr. Trump's first term and Gov. Chris Christie during the first year of Barack Obama's presidency.\n\nThe other top race is in Virginia, where Abigail Spanberger, the former congresswoman and C.I.A. case officer, is favored to win the governor's mansion and replace the outgoing Gov. Glenn Youngkin, a Republican.\n\nThe Republican nominee, Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, has never found her footing in a state that has been disproportionately affected both by the government shutdown and the Trump administration's shedding of federal jobs. Though Mr. Trump never endorsed Ms. Earle-Sears, the Spanberger campaign has barraged the airwaves with ads tying her to the president.\n\nMs. Spanberger and Ms. Sherrill, who were roommates when serving in Congress together, are both moderate Democrats who were first elected in the Democratic wave of 2018, helping the party flip control of the House in Mr. Trump's first term. Some party strategists see their candidacies -- even if they have not inspired the crowds and excitement of Mr. Mamdani's -- as templates for how to take the House again in 2026.\n\nBut Joe Gruters, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, downplayed the significance of the results even if Democrats swept the governors' races on Tuesday.\n\n\"I don't think it has any indication whatsoever on the 2026 midterm because these are both heavily blue states,\" Mr. Gruters said in an interview, praising Mr. Ciattarelli's campaign in particular. \"I think the fact that we're competitive and are running close campaigns is an indication that we're better off -- these are tough states for Republicans.\"\n\nThe entire Virginia House of Delegates is also up for election this year, with the possibility that Ms. Spanberger won't just win the governor's mansion but establish full Democratic control in the state.\n\nVirginia's most intense contest has proved to be the race for attorney general between the incumbent, Jason Miyares, and the Democratic nominee, Jay Jones. The Jones campaign has been consumed by the disclosure of old private text messages in which the candidate wished violence on his political enemies. Mr. Jones has apologized, but the scandal has spilled into the governor's race, dominating Ms. Earle-Sears's recent advertising.\n\nThe race is expected to test the boundaries of ticket-splitting in an era when it has become increasingly rare. Mr. Miyares is expected to depend on winning over Spanberger voters to score re-election.\n\nThroughout 2025, Democrats have celebrated a string of either victories or better-than-expected performances in races in heavily Republican districts. But those were in obscure special elections where extremely few voters turn out. The races on Tuesday offer the party a chance to prove its competitiveness on a bigger canvas.\n\nThe outcomes of low-turnout elections held in so-called off years are far from predictive. Just two years ago, Democrats scored a slate of big victories -- the Kentucky governorship, an abortion-rights measure in Ohio, control of the Virginia Legislature -- only to lose the White House and Senate in 2024.\n\nPredictive or not, any party would far prefer victory over defeat.\n\n\"A win to win, whether it's by one vote or 10 points or 20 points,\" Mr. Martin said.\n\nOne overlooked but potentially consequential set of races is the retention elections for the State Supreme Court in Pennsylvania, where three Democratic justices must win approval to keep their seats -- and thus maintain the party's majority on the court in the nation's premier battleground through the next presidential election.\n\nEugene DePasquale, who became chairman of the Pennsylvania Democratic Party this year, said that success in the judicial contests could help lift the party's spirits after Democrats suffered serious defeats there in 2024.\n\n\"Momentum matters,\" Mr. DePasquale said in an interview. \"We just have to start winning.\"",

        "title": "Democrats lean into fighter persona as party rebuilds ahead of 2026 midterms",
        "description": "Democrats, in the throes of rebuilding their party can agree, at least, on one thing: they are fed up with being portrayed as losers.\n\nSeveral ABC News interviews with Democratic strategists, current and former national staffers, and state-level officials raise several questions from within the party of how to best shift perceptions ahead of the midterms: does the party go full bore on anti-Trump messaging as the navigate the politics of the ongoing government shutdown and voters feel the pinch? Do they focus, instead, on boosting progressive rising stars even as Republicans paint the party as too-radical?\n\nSome less conventional Democrats question whether the party should bother relying on the traditional leadership structure, who may lean too much on outdated tactics, in Washington at all. While other, more traditional members, argue they're not in as much disarray as their critics claim.\n\nDemocrats in Washington point to recent wins as proof that their brand is not as toxic as some critics claim: two Republican legislative district flips in Iowa; electing a Democrat in a Pennsylvania state senate seat for the first time in 130 years; elevating a Democratic mayor to lead Omaha's blue dot, for example.\n\nThey're banking on likely successes in the days-away gubernatorial races in Virginia and New Jersey (and to a lesser extent, dominance in New York City's mayoral race) as reputational defibrillators a year out from the midterms.\n\n\"We have the momentum, certainly, heading into this final stretch,\" Democratic National Committee chairman Ken Martin told ABC News in a recent interview, of anticipated wins in New Jersey, Virginia, and Pennsylvania's supreme court races.\n\nYet a recent ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos poll found that more Americans say the Democratic Party is \"out of touch with the concerns of most people in the United States today\" (68%) than Trump (63%) and the Republican Party (61%).\n\nAsked on Sunday why more Americans feel this way about Democrats than the president -- even amidst the East Wing demolitions or a White House Halloween party hosted during the shutdown -- Martin suggested Republicans were in hotter water and disapproved of by Americans more.\n\nBut pressed on what Democrats are doing to try to get more in touch with voters -- or why he thinks, even if there is a swing away from Trump, people still see the Democrats as out of touch -- Martin said he's confident the party is making strides regardless of what the polls say.\n\n\"I can't speak to that because I've seen a lot of other polls that suggest just the opposite, right? People are starting to put their trust and faith back in with the Democratic Party. And you know, I can tell you right now that you know, we've been out there having conversations with voters, growing our coalition,\" Martin said, adding that Trump's policies and actions are creating an opening for Democrats to have conversations with disillusioned voters.\n\nDemocrats also hope to mine several lessons from their soon-to-be-released election analysis (don't call it a postmortem, members joke).\n\nOne of Martin biggest takeaways from the report, he told ABC News, is that \"everyone just started their campaign way too late, and we had already been defined before we ever had a chance to define ourselves ... we cannot wait to talk to voters until the final few months before an election.\"\n\nYet, some Democrats see their party's lower approval numbers (32%, per a recent Associated Press survey) and believe they should pivot away from the traditional party apparatus.\n\n\"We are a party without a leader, and so there is no one to set the tone,\" a former DNC staffer and Democratic strategist told ABC News.\n\nThey argue that there are vulnerabilities beyond the DNC, but also from more classical candidate recruitment from congressional leadership's political operation, who they suggested are not taking necessary risks on non-traditional picks. Sen. Chuck Schumer is reportedly facing resistance to his leadership among potential Senate candidates.\n\nA second former DNC staffer, who has since worked on presidential campaigns, put it more bluntly: \"The current iteration of the DNC has weakened itself out of relevance and should not be seen as anything but a fundraising vessel.\"\n\nLibby Schneider, deputy executive director of the DNC, concedes that it's typical after an election loss to be heartbroken and upset, and understands there may be some criticism in its wake. Despite that, she argues the committee is laser-focused on winning and wishes to be a tool to help candidates succeed.\n\n\"People can feel what they need to feel and grieve how they need to grieve about this loss, and we will change the things that we need to change in order to continue to perform well. But to me, people complaining tells me that they care a whole lot, and I think that that's valuable. And also, frankly, we can listen to that stuff and still do our jobs every day to elect Democrats,\" said Schneider.\n\n\"We went from being the party of cool with Barack Obama to turning into the party of nerds and dweebs and losers, right? What is really annoying about all of it is that we have winners. We have good stars,\" the second staffer continued. told ABC News.\n\nObama has aligned himself, and whatever residual it-factor he possesses, with marquee political fights over the last few months: rallying Texas Democrats who broke quorum, in-person campaigning for both the Virginia and New Jersey gubernatorial races, boosting Democrats in Pennsylvania's supreme court elections, to cutting ads for Gov. Gavin Newsom's redistricting proposition.\n\nFormer Vice President Kamala Harris is also keeping her options open on her political career, as she publicly doesn't rule out another White House run during her book tour.\n\nThere's no consensus that Harris is the exciting nominee she once was -- though the first former DNC staffer suggests.\n\n\"She shouldn't be sent out to pasture -- she made the most out of an impossible situation for four years. At the same time, if we're serious about telling voters we're moving forward -- she can't be our nominee in 2028. Is she a leading voice in the party, yes? Should she be our main and only voice, absolutely not,\" the first former DNC staffer added.\n\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders has also been criss-crossing the country with rumored '28 candidate Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez drawing substantial crowds, meanwhile, former Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel and Newsom have not shied away from their ambitions, either.\n\nSome Democrats argue that not having one main spokesperson presents an opportunity for the various stars, rising or seasoned, to sparkle.\n\n\"We have to be a tent that wins by addition and not subtraction,\" Schneider said. She feels confident ahead of Tuesday's elections, and believes that there's a strong case to be made to voters about Trump's impact on their bottom line, their health care premiums, their overall cost of living, as well as voters' souring on the president's handling of the economy and immigration.\n\nPer a new ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos poll, roughly 6 in 10 Americans disapprove of Trump's handling of the job.\n\nAnd despite worries of disinterested donors and shrinking voter registration, the campaign arms of the party, taking cues from Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, are outraising their Republican counterparts, even as the national party heavily lags in that arena. The DSCC raised nearly $20 million in Q3, versus the NRSC's $18 million, and the DCCC currently has a slight cash-on-hand edge, with $46.6 million to the NRCC's $45.8. A DNC official says the committee\n\nFormer Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, who rebuilt the DNC as chair after the party's devastating losses in 2001, is bullish on his party's chances to sweep over the next year, as he believes droves of voters will reject Trump due to rising costs, shrinking access to health care, and negative impacts of the government shutdown, and trickle back to Democrats after this off-cycle election day.\n\n\"The Democratic Party is poised to take off like a booster rocket,\" said McAuliffe, who, a few weeks ago, hosted a packed fundraiser for Virginia's Democratic gubernatorial candidate, Abigail Spanberger, at his home alongside the Clintons on behalf of the Democratic Governors' Association.\n\nMcAuliffe said the 400-or-so attendees raised $2.2 million in one night -- proof, he argues, of his party's unquestionable desire to win. His message to hand-wringers and eye-rollers, even some within the party, echoes from what many at the top tell ABC: \"We need to be encouraged, people are counting on us to fight. I'm tired of the whining, complaining, the party of lemon suckers. Get in the game.\"\n\nJaime Harrison, Martin's most recent predecessor at the DNC, realized the extent of his party's vulnerabilities during his 2020 Senate bid to unseat Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham. (Santa Claus could run on Christmas as a Democrat and lose, he jokes.)\n\nHarrison worries about the perceptions of disjointedness, and suggested that various groups like the DGA, members of Congress, and the DNC convene for a joint-policy retreat \"so that people see we're all in alignment on our message, on our mission.\"\n\nHarrison also said he hopes the party seriously considers hosting a midterm convention, which could amplify their talent and hammer home their priorities. Schneider said a potential event is \"in the mix.\"\n\n\"The Democrats are looking for a unity of purpose, a unity of message, a unity of strategy. And it's important that the leadership right now provides that,\" said Harrison, who says he trusts Martin and believes support, from donors and otherwise, will return after Democratic wins on Tuesday.\n\n\"I'm not overly concerned. If we were in June of '26 and we're still not getting major donors, then I'm concerned. But we're not there yet,\" he added, expressing confidence in the continued grassroots support.\n\nSome Democrats also point to Martin's tenure as one that prioritizes infrastructure. For example, state parties now get major influxes of cash, to the tune of a million dollars a month, to hire staff, set up programs, and fortify their ranks. \"Party changing money,\" adds Schneider. Lauren Nechochea, chair of the Idaho Democrats, told ABC News her chapter now has steady, monthly financial support.\n\nTexas Rep. Gene Wu, chair of the Lone Star State House Democratic caucus, said Jefferies and Martin gave his cohort full support to break quorum and attempt to block Republican redistricting efforts, a move that kicked off the party's more aggressive opposition to redistricting nationwide.\n\nWu acknowledges that the perception of the Democratic Party is in peril, and is anxious for politicians to openly fight for the working class. He says voters, friends see Democrats as message-less, scolding hall monitors.\n\n\"People who would rather be right than win; people who would rather spend the time to tell other people how they're wrong instead of telling people what they would do about it and how they're going to fix it,\" Wu told ABC News.\n\nWu said candidates need to be firmer on their beliefs, and his party must run candidates willing to take Republicans to task (like California's Gov. Newsom in his push to draw Democratic friendly maps) or face total failure.\n\n\"I think that the reality of where we are today and what the cost of failure will mean, I don't think people are under any illusion of where we are at this moment,\" said Wu, who added, \"this is not time for us to screw around ... I don't give a crap that you think Democrats are wimpy or whatever else. But if you want America to not suck anymore, you better join us.\"",

        "title": "The imperial aesthetic at the heart of Donald Trump's presidency",
        "description": "A banner featuring President Donald Trump on the U.S. Department of Agriculture building. (Pete Kiehart/For The Washington Post)\n\nAgencies have hung enormous portraits of President Donald Trump outside their buildings. The Treasury Department is preparing to mint a commemorative coin that shows Trump raising a heroic fist. The president is planning a triumphal arch across from the Lincoln Memorial for America's 250th birthday.\n\nTrump has also added 24-karat golden adornments to the Oval Office, giving it a palatial feel. He has arranged to receive a luxurious Boeing jetliner from Qatar. He has ordered thicker paper, decorated with gold, for the letters he writes to military officers who are becoming generals.\n\nTrump's aggressive moves to accumulate political power -- deploying National Guard troops, invoking massive tariffs -- have prompted protests and lawsuits as well as plaudits. But he is also asserting his power through what might be called an imperial aesthetic: surrounding his presidency with visual cues designed to project personal command and grandeur.\n\n\"What it's intended to convey is a kind of martial strength, the kind of presence of power that you see a lot of dictators around the world wanting to project,\" said Sen. Adam Schiff (D-California). \"The gold ornate style, the imposing portraiture, the military parades, the physical depiction on currency -- this is what you see from state-run authoritarian regimes.\"\n\nMost recently and starkly, construction has begun on a 90,000-square-foot White House ballroom that will be almost as large as the rest of the White House complex, creating a monumental structure that, Trump's supporters hope, will be associated with his presidency long after he has left office.\n\nIn recent days, Trump's aspirations to an imperial aura have become even more literal. When large crowds turned out for a \"No Kings\" protest on Oct. 18, Trump responded with an AI-generated video of himself wearing a crown, piloting a plane with \"King Trump\" inscribed on the side and dumping what appeared to be feces on protesters.\n\nThe penchant for the gold and grand has not been lost on those seeking Trump's favor. South Korean leaders on Wednesday gave the president a replica of a historic golden crown, saying it symbolized peace and unity. Apple CEO Tim Cook in August gifted the president a glass plaque with a 24-karat gold base.\n\nWhite House communications director Steven Cheung said in a statement that Trump's changes will benefit all Americans.\n\n\"This is not an imperial aesthetic, this is an American aesthetic,\" Cheung said.\n\nTevi Troy, a presidential historian who was a senior official in the administration of George W. Bush, said Trump's aesthetic suggests less an aspiration to royalty than a background as a real estate developer.\n\n\"He has a sense of what he thinks American building and American power should look like, and that is reflected in whatever plans he puts forward,\" Troy said. \"I don't think it's necessarily monarchical. It just reflects what he thinks it should look like, which is different from what others think it should look like.\"\n\nOther presidents have also brought their aesthetic tastes to the White House, Troy noted. Richard M. Nixon, influenced by the pageantry he saw in Europe, ordered ornate uniforms for the Secret Service, prompting widespread mockery. Bush, who cherished a cowboy image, had Western paintings hung throughout the building.\n\nYet Trump's changes have been more dramatic and grandiose than those of any president in recent memory. To his critics, they are the physical counterpart of what they see as his un-American grasp for overwhelming power.\n\nThat is especially true of the planned ballroom, for which the East Wing of the White House has now been demolished. California Gov. Gavin Newsom called it a \"knockoff Versailles on White House grounds.\" Schiff said it brings to mind the gaudy palaces of such former dictators as Romania's Nicolae Ceausescu and Iraq's Saddam Hussein.\n\nSome Democrats say the next president should demolish the ballroom, which is proceeding without input from Congress or other government bodies. On Tuesday, Trump fired all six members of the Commission of Fine Arts, an independent agency that had expected to review the ballroom and arch.\n\nSo far the project is not popular: Americans oppose tearing down the East Wing for a ballroom by a 2-to-1 margin (56 percent-28 percent), according to a Washington Post-ABC News-Ipsos poll released Thursday.\n\nThe White House is working to communicate an image of Trump as a historical figure in other ways as well.\n\nBrandon Beach, treasurer of the United States, has confirmed that commemorative $1 coins honoring Trump are being planned for next year. That means Trump \"will forever be the face of America's 250th Birthday,\" conservative commentator Steve Guest posted on X.\n\nThe president's daughter in law, Lara Trump, has proposed that Trump's face grace a new $25 or $45 bill -- or perhaps a $47 bill, in recognition of his role as the 47th president.\n\nCritics say honors in America have been traditionally granted many years after a figure passes from the scene to avoid erecting memorials to figures whom history may judge to be unworthy. Construction on the Washington Monument began in 1848, a half-century after George Washington left office; Abraham Lincoln first appeared on the $5 bill in 1914, almost 50 years after his assassination.\n\n\"I don't think it fits into our traditions to build monument to himself. No president has done in that in history,\" Schiff said. \"It would be the equivalent of Washington building his own Washington Monument. I think if anything, our history is one of preservation of our legacy, of making the White House be the people's house.\"\n\nIn September, Schiff issued a report charging that the administration, by hanging large banners with Trump's image outside government agencies, was illegally engaging in propaganda. To emphasize the point, Schiff's office appended photos of the large banners hung by such dictators as Joseph Stalin and Benito Mussolini.\n\nTrump's supporters say the president is not naming such projects as the ballroom after himself, and that they will benefit the country for years to come. \"It's going to be a permanent renovation that will enhance the White House for all future presidents,\" Rep. Steve Scalise (R-Louisiana) told reporters.\n\nBut critics say that unilaterally imposing his own over-the-top vision on the landscape is Trump's way of proclaiming his own grandeur, not the country's. On Friday, Trump unveiled pictures of the White House's Lincoln Bathroom redone with white marble and gold fixtures, in sharp contrast to the bedroom itself.\n\n\"Trump has long treated all forms of architecture as tools of personal identity,\" said Debbie Millman, who chairs the masters in branding program at the School of Visual Arts in New York. \"Trump will call it the Trump ballroom, because it is already an extension of the Trump equity. This enduring building will be reshaped in the image of Trump's brand.\"\n\nTrump denied reports that he was considering naming the ballroom after himself as \"fake news,\" suggesting the Presidential Ballroom as one name possibility.\n\nDavid Harrison, who chairs the French Department at Grinnell College and is an expert in French history, said Trump's aesthetic has always owed a good deal to the palace at Versailles, which came to symbolize the excesses of the French monarchy.\n\n\"From Donald Trump's first forays into personal architecture, there is a clear throughline that Versailles, and particularly the Hall of Mirrors, is the model of power and authority,\" Harrison said. \"It seems to represent an aesthetic of personal glory, of authority, of luxury.\"\n\nBeyond the decorative, the Trump administration has regularly engineered scenes designed to portray him as a global colossus.\n\nCabinet meetings have become venues for officials to deliver a nonstop flow of compliments. He personally reviewed a military parade, a rarity for a U.S. president, on June 14 -- a day that was both the U.S. Army's birthday and his own, inspired by French commemorations of Bastille Day.\n\nHis aides' public praise is strikingly florid. \"Let me just say, Mr. President, that this country was going to die without you,\" Stephen Miller, the deputy White House chief of staff, told the president at an Oct. 23 event. \"This country was going to actually die without you. ... You alone saved it.\"\n\nTroy said unilateralism is at the heart of Trump's presidency, and reshaping the physical environment is part of that.\n\n\"I've had this theory that Trump does not have an ideology so much as a methodology, and that methodology is unilateralism,\" Troy said. \"He learned in his first term that the courts and the legislature can stand in his way. In his second term, he is emphasizing things like pardons, tariffs, executive order -- and reordering the White House.\"\n\nTrump's clearest predecessor when it comes to White House redesign may be President Chester A. Arthur, who hired Louis Comfort Tiffany, the most famed designer of his day, to give the White House a sweeping -- some would say gaudy -- makeover in the early 1880s.\n\nStill, Arthur was reacting to a White House that had become shabby and run-down over the years, not remaking an already stately mansion as Trump is doing.\n\nHistorically, Harrison said, structures that are built as witnesses to a ruler's power often fade or crumble with time, coming to represent instead the futility of excessive ambition.\n\n\"Construction can be intended to project authority, dignity, glory and a desire for immortality,\" Harrison said. \"But the reality is that many of things we think of as being done for that reason later come to represent the exact opposite -- the vanity and the ephemerality of human wishes.\"",

        "title": "Is mega-phony Gavin Newsom the best the Democrats can do?",
        "description": "Gavin Newsom admits he has an eye on a 2028 presidential run, and the sad thing is: The California governor might be the best Democrats can manage.\n\nUnlike ex-Veep Kamala Harris and others (Pete Buttigieg), he can pretend he was unaware of President Joe Biden's sagging faculties without triggering open laughter.\n\nUnlike Pennsylvania's Gov. Josh Shapiro, he's toed the far-left regularly enough to (perhaps) be acceptable to the party's base, who may find running a white male non-socialist acceptable if it can get them back to power.\n\nNewsom's also put some effort into seeming quasi-moderate: In California, he's vetoed a far-left bill or three nearly every year to signal his \"reasonableness,\" but the fake moderation barely runs skin-deep.\n\nThe horrors of Los Angeles' Figueroa Street, for example, have now made national news: The red-light district sprawls along dozens of blocks, lined with preteen girls in lingerie, many plucked from the foster-care system, pimped out by cold-blooded traffickers -- so openly that the area is now known as the \"Kiddie Stroll.\"\n\nAnd Newsom bears prime responsibility, having signed the obscenely misnamed \"Safer Streets for All Act\" in 2022, which banned cops from arresting suspected prostitutes for loitering -- and so removing a key tool for police to rescue kids dragooned into the sex trade.\n\nHe's such a phony, as in a recent podcast where he cast his upbringing as a scrappy school-of-hard-knocks, claimed he grew up on \"Wonder Bread\" and \"mac and cheese\" and his mother \"hustled\" to pay bills, \"grinding every single day\" and working \"two and a half jobs\" while sports got him \"into college.\"\n\nAll bull: His mom might've work a few menial gigs post-divorce, but his father was a massively successful lawyer who managed the finances of the billionaire Getty family, which has sponsored Newsom for his entire \"business\" and political career.\n\nIn an early bout of podcast fakery, he told the late Charlie Kirk that he saw transgender athletes in girls' and women's sports as \"deeply unfair\" and admitted to Shawn Ryan that Democrats' position on gender reassignments for minors is a \"major problem\" for the party.\n\nBut he's never actually taken a firm stand that would upset the Dem base on either front.\n\nHe's slammed President Donald Trump for not being a better role model, while calling him a \"son of a bitch\" in the same breath; he's criticized his party for focusing on \"personality\" over substance, while trolling online with Trump-like social-media posting.\n\nHe's said Democrats need to make clear what they \"stand for,\" while he shapeshifts by the hour, decrying wokeism in one interview and then saying that \"anti-woke stuff is just anti-black\" in another.\n\nHe clearly expects the left-leaning national media to cover for his contradictions and for his failures from Figueroa to the Los Angeles wildfires, to hide how the Golden State is falling apart on his watch, as residents flee high taxes, high cost of living and plummeting quality of life.\n\nThe servile California media have made that easier for their national comrades, but Newsom's in for an unpleasant surprise on that front.\n\nIt's about to get a lot harder for Greasy Gavin to sell his the snake oil.",

        "title": "SNAP benefits in jeopardy as government shutdown drags into fifth week",
        "description": "As the government shutdown entered its fifth week, the ongoing stalemate began to threaten vital food assistance programs relied upon by tens of millions of Americans, prompting surging demand and long lines at food banks nationwide.\n\nThe Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as food stamps, became a flashpoint after a federal court ordered the Trump administration to back off its plan to halt funding due to the shutdown.\n\nDespite the court order, delays in SNAP payouts, which help low-income Americans buy groceries, are putting millions of poor Americans in a pinch, fueling uncertainty about how they will afford food.\n\nIt is a reminder of how the shutdown's ripple effects continue to mount. Hundreds of thousands of federal workers have missed paychecks, and major airports are grappling with flight delays and cancellations due to staffing shortages.\n\nPresident Trump and Republicans have pinned the blame on Senate Democrats, who are filibustering a House-passed stopgap bill to fund the government through Nov. 21.\n\nDemocrats are demanding an extension of enhanced Obamacare premium subsidies that help people afford health insurance and are set to expire at the end of the year.\n\nSEE ALSO: Democrats accuse Trump admin, GOP of weaponizing hunger amid legal battle over SNAP benefits\n\nThey also want a reversal of the future Medicaid spending cuts included in Mr. Trump's \"Big, Beautiful\" bill.\n\nPressure on Democrats intensified last week when the American Federation of Government Employees -- representing hundreds of thousands of unpaid federal workers -- endorsed the Republican funding measure.\n\nMeanwhile, the legal battle over SNAP escalated after 25 states and the District of Columbia sued the administration, arguing it could tap into contingency funds to keep the program running.\n\nThe Department of Agriculture planned to freeze payments from funds needed to cover the cost of the food program starting Nov. 1, saying it could no longer continue funding it due to the shutdown.\n\nThen on Friday, two federal judges simultaneously ordered the administration to make the payments with contingency funds.\n\nU.S District Judge John J. McConnell in Rhode Island gave the administration until Monday to detail its plan for funding SNAP.\n\n\"There is no question that the congressionally approved contingency funds must be used now because of the shutdown,\" Judge McConnell wrote in his order.\n\nMr. Trump said he would provide the money, but wanted more clarity from the court.\n\n\"It will be my honor to provide the funding, just like I did with military and law enforcement pay,\" Mr. Trump said on Truth Social.\n\nOn Sunday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that the \"courts keep jamming up things,\" reiterating that Mr. Trump \"wants to make sure that people get their food benefits.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries accused Mr. Trump of \"weaponizing hunger.\"\n\n\"It's very unfortunate that Donald Trump and Republicans have decided to weaponize hunger and withhold SNAP benefits,\" Mr. Jeffries, New York Democrat, said on CNN's State of the Union.\n\nMeanwhile, the public could be souring on Mr. Trump and Republicans.\n\nAn NBC News survey found that 52% of voters blame Mr. Trump and Republicans for the shutdown, compared to 42% who fault Democrats. A Washington Post-ABC News-Ipsos poll showed similar results, with 45% blaming Republicans and 33% blaming Democrats.\n\nPlus, nearly six in ten voters disapproved of the president's overall job performance, including his handling of the economy, tariffs, and overall management of the government.\n\nThe political fallout could be felt in Tuesday's gubernatorial elections in Virginia and New Jersey -- off-year contests often seen as early indicators of national sentiment, though they frequently go against the party that holds the White House, especially in Virginia.\n\nDemocrats lead in both races and hope to rebound after a disappointing 2024 election cycle.\n\nVoters in California are also weighing in on a new set of congressional maps, backed by Gov. Gavin Newsom and state Democrats.\n\nThe maps are intended to create more Democratic-friendly districts and bypass the state's nonpartisan commission, which was set up exactly to avoid partisan gerrymandering.\n\nThe map is California Democrats' answer to the Trump-inspired redistricting efforts in Republican-led states that aim to give the GOP a better shot at holding onto its slim House majority in next year's midterms.\n\nDuring an appearance on NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" Mr. Newsom predicted a big night for Democrats.\n\n\"This is a historically unpopular president,\" Mr. Newsom said. \"His policies are even more unpopular than the president himself.\"\n\nHe added, \"In every core category, he's underwater.\"\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson painted a different picture on \"Fox News Sunday.\"\n\nDismissing the idea that the public is turning on Republicans, Mr. Johnson cited a recent CNN survey that found the GOP brand has improved in voters' eyes during the shutdown.\n\n\"This is not about winning a political contest here. Real people are losing; the American people are hurting,\" Mr. Johnson, Louisiana Republican, said. \"Democrats have voted 14 times now to keep the government closed. 14 times.\"\n\n-- This article is based in part on wire reports.",

I'm going to express my relationship to my truth with the former President of the United States, including at the end of his term, quite literally in December, which was a master class of foreign policy and domestic policy,\" Newsom said. \"There was nothing to suggest what you just said or others have suggested in terms of my interaction.

We could talk about the 107 days. We could talk about the lack of an open primary. We could talk about 'The View.' Again, I'm on page six of the 24 pages. And how you unpack that, how you stack that in terms of everything, I think needs still a little bit more forensics, a little more analysis,\" he said.\n\nNewsom revealed during an interview on Oct. 26 that he would give a possible run for the presidency serious thought after the 2026 midterm elections.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE\n\nWelker asked the Democratic governor why he wanted to be president during the \"Meet the Press\" interview.\n\nCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"I don't.

        "title": "Gavin Newsom has high hopes  --  but rock-bottom results",
        "description": "When New York was the most populous and economically dominant state in the 19th and much of the 20th century, it was natural its governors would be quadrennial contenders for the presidency.\n\nThe Empire State sent four of its governors on to the White House (Martin Van Buren, Grover Cleveland, Theodore Roosevelt and Franklin Roosevelt) but supplied nominees or serious contenders in numerous other cycles (Samuel Tilden, Al Smith, Tom Dewey, Averell Harriman and Nelson Rockefeller, to name a few).\n\nAfter California became the most populous and prosperous state in the early 1960s, it was expected its governors would become top contenders for the Oval Office every four years.\n\nBut so far California has only sent Ronald Reagan from Sacramento to the White House.\n\nOther Golden State governors who've tried (Jerry Brown in 1976, 1980 and 1992; Pete Wilson in 1996) fell flat.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom is hoping to break the dry spell.\n\nNewsom can be opaque at times, but his ambition for the presidency is so obvious that he's dropped the usual coy clich\u00e9s about how \"I'm focusing on my current job\" and instead last week admitted that \"I'd just be lying\" if he said he wasn't thinking hard about a presidential run.\n\nThis is a notable shift for Newsom, who for the last several years has repeatedly demurred from any hint, saying \"I have no idea\" \"Fate will determine,\" and even \"Who the hell knows?\" whether he would run someday.\n\nOne factor that may have forced Newsom's shift was former Vice President Kamala Harris's statement that \"I'm not done\" with public life, hinting she's strongly considering another run in 2028.\n\nIt's an open secret in California that Harris and Newsom are bitter rivals, and Newsom can't let Harris get the jump on lining up support -- and campaign-contribution pledges -- from the state's formidable Democratic money-and-influence machine.\n\nNewsom and Harris top the early opinion polls for the 2028 Democratic nomination, but at this early point such polls mostly reflect name familiarity. The past several presidential election cycles have featured early front-runners in both parties who fizzled out once real campaigning and primary voting started.\n\nNewsom, however, has been shrewdly positioning himself with aggressive steps to shore up support from the Democratic Party's ascendant progressive base. He has been visiting early primary states and putting out cheeky social-media posts aping President Trump's wild style, while Harris is content with a book tour that isn't moving many copies of her book.\n\nBy far his most bold move is Proposition 50, which Californians vote on this week. Prop. 50 will take congressional redistricting out of the hands of an \"independent\" commission (that Democrats have largely gamed to their advantage already) and return it to the Democrat-dominated state Legislature.\n\nNewsom's proposed district map will likely cost Republicans five of the nine House seats (out of 52 total) they currently have. It is meant to counterbalance moves in Republican states such as Texas to draw new congressional districts for next year that should yield big GOP gains in the House.\n\nSpecial-election initiatives in California have often backfired. Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger tried a special election package of reforms that lost badly, and Ronald Reagan's Proposition 1 in 1973 -- a tax-and-spending-limitation initiative -- also lost badly, damaging his planned 1976 presidential campaign.\n\nBut Newsom has promoted Prop. 50 as a way to \"fight Trump,\" and polls indicate his gamble is going to work, with the initiative likely to cruise to victory this week. It will be a major talking point for Democrats in other states.\n\nThere are other reasons, though, to think Newsom's shooting star will flame out in 2028. New York and California used to be swing states of a sort, electing Democrats and Republicans in roughly equal numbers to statewide office. But California especially is a deep-blue state today and not representative of the nation as a whole.\n\nNewsom's record is far to the left, with dreadful results on everything from crime to homelessness, deep budget deficits, poorly performing public schools, a high-speed-rail line to nowhere (that will never be completed), the nation's highest energy costs, unaffordable housing and an economy seemingly designed to be hostile to the middle class.\n\nIt takes almost malevolent misgovernment to drive several hundred thousand residents to leave a state with such beauty and natural advantages, but somehow monopoly Democratic rule has accomplished it.\n\nWith Hollywood and Silicon Valley both shrinking their footprint in the state, \"dynamic\" no longer applies to California, and no one will believe talk of any kind of \"California promise.\" \"Make America California\" is not going to be a winning slogan.\n\nBy the end of the 2028 campaign Newsom will wish he had just booked more dinners at the French Laundry instead.",

        "title": "Trump held 'Gatsby'-themed Halloween party as SNAP benefits were due to be cut off",
        "description": "President Donald Trump hosted a 1920's theme party at Mar-A-Lago on Oct. 31, as multiple federal judges ruled the administration could not stop funding food aid amid the ongoing government shutdown.\n\nThe party was labeled \"A Little Party Never Killed Nobody\" according to multiple media attendees. The title was drawn from a song on the soundtrack of the 2013 movie adaptation of \"The Great Gatsby.\"\n\nAttendees included Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Ivanka and Tiffany Trump, and their husbands, Jared Kushner and Michael Boulos, according to ABC News. Trump did not speak while reporters were present, the network reported.\n\nGuests were seen mimicking \"Roaring 20's\" era attire, a period just before the Great Depression that historians note for its staggering income inequity. History.com notes that in 1928 the top 1% of families received 23.9% of all pretax income and about 60% of families made less than the income level the Bureau of Labor Statistics classified as the minimum livable income for a family of five.\n\nThe party in the midst of an extended federal government shutdown drew sharp criticism from Democrats, with California Gov. Gavin Newsom saying on social media that Trump \"does not give a damn about you.\"\n\n\"The way he rubs his inhumanity in Americans\" (sic) face never ceases to stun me,\" Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy said on X. \"He's illegally refusing to pay food stamp benefits... ...while he throws a ridiculously over the top Gatsby party for his right wing millionaire and corporate friends.\"\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Anna Kelly called Democrats \"full of it\" in a statement ABC News. \"President Trump has consistently called on them to do the right thing and reopen the government, which they could do at any time,\" Kelly said.\n\nSNAP benefits ordered to restart\n\nJudges in Massachusetts and Rhode Island issued orders within minutes of each other on Oct. 31 that compelled the department to use $5.25 billion in contingency funds to continue the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as SNAP or food stamps.\n\n\"There is no doubt and it is beyond argument that irreparable harm will begin to occur if it hasn't already occurred in the terror it has caused some people about the availability of funding for food, for their family,\" U.S. District Judge John McConnell ruled in Rhode Island.\n\nSNAP benefits for 42 million low-income Americans were set to run out Nov. 1. However, the Rhode Island State Council of Churches, the National Council of Nonprofits and several other nonprofits and mayors filed a federal lawsuit to keep the program running.\n\nJustice Department lawyers have argued it isn't possible to provide partial benefits for the program, which spends up to $9 billion per month, from a $5 billion contingency fund.\n\nMassachusetts Federal District Judge Indira Talwani ruled against that argument, saying that the government has the option to provide reduced benefits with the contingency funds or shift other discretionary funds to cover the shortfall.\n\nIn a brief written order, McConnell told the U.S. Department of Agriculture to use contingency funds to continue providing benefits. He asked the government to report by noon on Nov. 3 about the status of the distribution.\n\n\"For now, these families can continue putting food on their tables, and thousands of nonprofit food banks, pantries and other organizations across the country can avoid the impossible burden that would have resulted if SNAP benefits had been halted,\" said Diane Yentel, CEO of the National Council of Nonprofits.\n\nTrump claimed on Truth Social that the government would provide SNAP funding if given \"appropriate legal direction by the Court.\"",

        "title": "Gerrymandering, migration and political violence set the stage for America's great unraveling",
        "description": "Political tribes redraw maps, rewrite morals and remove opponents until ballots no longer matter\n\nWe live in uncertain times, and three key features of the current landscape increase the likelihood of political violence.\n\nFirst, for more than a decade, blue states have been losing population to red states. Over the past 10 years, New York has lost approximately 2 million residents; New Jersey and Illinois have each lost around 500,000. About 2 million refugees have fled the Golden State in the past 15 years. On the other side of the coin are Texas and Florida, each of which has gained nearly 2 million residents in recent years.\n\nPolitical people, being the narrow, small-minded people that we are, instantly gravitate to explanations that the flight from blue states to red states is all or mostly about state governmental policy, especially taxes. In other words, the citizenry is sorting itself out based on political preferences.\n\nSecond, and in a very much related development, Republicans in a handful of states -- Texas being the most prominent -- have decided that they want to maximize the number of congressional districts they control by redrawing the lines that demarcate those districts. Not surprisingly, Democrats have joined this electoral arms race, most energetically in California.\n\nWhen elected officials get to pick their voters, the value and purpose of elections are minimized and the value of incumbency is maximized. Gerrymandering inevitably results in a system where adherence to partisan norms, rather than representing voters' interests, becomes the most critical focus and goal of the elected official.\n\nGerrymandering leads to anti-democratic results. The California House delegation consists of 43 Democrats and nine Republicans. Gov. Gavin Newsom has indicated that he can reduce the number of Republicans in the delegation to just four, making the new split 48-4. In the most recent elections in California, about 60% of voters voted for Democratic candidates in House races and about 40% voted for Republican candidates. If you just split the delegation along those lines, it would have about 38 Democrats and 21 Republicans.\n\nIn Illinois, the House delegation consists of 14 Democrats and three Republicans despite the fact that in 2024, about 47% of Illinois voters voted for Republican House candidates. That delegation should have nine Democrats and eight Republicans.\n\nIt is not just the Democrats. Missouri's House delegation is 75% Republican. In 2024, 58% of Missouri voters voted for Republicans. If the proposed map in Texas is adopted, Republicans would hold about 80% of the House seats from Texas, despite winning only 58% of the vote. In Florida, about 70% of the House delegation is Republican; again, only 58% of the voters voted for Republican House candidates in 2024.\n\nIn short, and most relevant to this moment, gerrymandering exacerbates our political divisions by essentially disenfranchising political minorities. If voters aren't represented through the political process, they will eventually find other outlets for their concerns.\n\nFinally, in my neighborhood in suburban Richmond, Virginia, there are more than a few yard signs that encourage people to vote for Jay Jones for attorney general. Mr. Jones' principal claim to fame is that he spoke openly and enthusiastically about killing the speaker of the Virginia House of Delegates, as well as the man's children. Despite that, among the well-off and exceedingly polite people of Chesterfield County, there are obviously more than a handful who are OK with assassinations and who advertise their support for a would-be assassin for political office.\n\nAll three of these features of our current political landscape -- people choosing where to live based on politics, gerrymandering so thorough that it essentially precludes participation in the political process by those who are part of the minority party in a particular state, and (especially egregious and worrisome) a willingness of some voters to support murderous violence against their enemies -- conspire to make national political dissolution appear to be a very real possibility.\n\nThe first two make it much more likely that states will become redder or bluer, thereby maximizing the potential for irreconcilable conflicts. The third one makes political violence much more likely.\n\nIn 1859, as he headed toward the gallows after his failed effort to seize the federal armory at Harpers Ferry, Virginia, and ignite a slave rebellion, John Brown, the prophet of the apocalypse that was coming, gave the hangman a note. It read, in part: \"I, John Brown, am now quite certain that the crimes of this guilty land will never be purged away, but with blood.\"\n\nHe was, of course, correct.",

        "title": "Newsom claims he 'never had' concerns about Biden's capacity --...",
        "description": "California Gov. Gavin Newsom claimed Sunday that he \"never had\" any doubt about former President Joe Biden's mental capacity to run the country -- except after that one little infamous California fundraiser.\n\nAt the June 2024 fundraiser in Los Angeles, the then-prez didn't recognize megawatt celeb, co-host and longtime pal George Clooney -- leaving the actor \"shaken to the core,'' a book co-authored by CNN's Jake Tapper has said.\n\nNewsom, asked on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" whether he ever had concerns about Biden's decline in the Oval Office, insisted, I never had that.\n\n\"The one exception, as it relates to the interaction I had with him, that gave me pause, one, was the fundraiser in Southern California,\" the gov then added. \"And all of us were a little taken aback. But we also were mindful that [Biden] had been in Europe twice in about a week.\"\n\nFewer than two weeks after the fundraiser, Biden engaged in a televised debate with Donald Trump -- a disastrous showing that paved the way for the Dem to drop out of the race less than a month later.\n\nNewsom on Sunday at times appeared to ignore what nearly the entire nation -- including many of Biden's closest allies -- saw at the time.\n\nThe term-limited California governor instead stubbornly ticked off Biden's top achievements, such as the CHIPS and Science Act and the COVID-19 pandemic recovery, as examples of the former president's abilities in office.\n\n\"I just talked to the president a few hours ago. I've been privileged to have a relationship with the president,\" Newsom said.\n\nStill, Newsom -- who recently declared that Biden \"was one of the most successful presidents in the last century\" and insisted, \"I will defend that to my grave\" -- admitted that \"with grace and humility,\" he privately raised the alarms about the 46th president's debate debacle.\n\nAsked why he didn't go public with those concerns, Newsom replied, \"For me, it wasn't my job to go out there.\n\n\"My job was to let [Biden], give him the space,\" he said. \"I just have a different approach.\"\n\nNewsom also dodged a question about whether he believed Biden was fit for another four years in the White House before he dropped out.\n\n\"I think my focus was, frankly, situational,\" he said, sidestepping the question. \"It was making sure Donald Trump didn't get back into office, to experience everything that we're experiencing today. And there was no interaction I had that suggested otherwise.\"\n\nDuring his wide-ranging interview, the Golden State Democrat also addressed his recent admission that he's considering a run for president in 2028.\n\nAsked why he wants to be president, Newsom shot back, \"I'm not suggesting I am\" running.\n\n\"[There's] nothing I dislike more than a politician that sits there and lies to you. And we all just sit there rolling our eyes, going 'Give me a break.'\n\n\"We'll see what happens.\"\n\nIronically, Newsom had once drawn speculation that he could mount a 2024 primary challenge against Biden but repeatedly rejected that at the time and worked to put on a united front with the 46th president.",

This copy may not be in its final form, may be updated and may contain minor transcription errors. For previous show transcripts, visit the \"This Week\" transcript archive.\n\nMARTHA RADDATZ, ABC \"THIS WEEK\" ANCHOR: Just two days until voters cast their final ballots in high-stakes elections, all in the shadow of a far-reaching government shutdown. A special edition of \"THIS WEEK\" starts right now.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): The money's there. And Trump has said, don't spend a dime.\n\nDONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: But all the Democrats have to do is say, let's go. I mean, you know, they don't have to do anything.\n\nRADDATZ: Federal programs start running dry as the month-long shutdown hits home.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We are one of the wealthiest countries in the world, yet we're willing to let people go hungry.\n\nRADDATZ: The impacts of the spending freeze cascading into American life.\n\nTRANSPORTATION SECRETARY SEAN DUFFY: Our traffic will be snarled. But it will be a disaster in aviation.\n\nRADDATZ: As voters in several states prepare for the first major elections since President Trump's return to the White House.\n\nWINSOME EARLE-SEARS (R), VIRGINIA GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE: As we all know, this race, the world is watching!\n\nABIGAIL SPANBERGER (D), VIRGINIA GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE: The results on Tuesday will be a reflection of what it is that we are for.\n\nRADDATZ: We visit New Jersey, a blue stronghold that saw one of the hardest shifts to the right in 2024.\n\nJACK CIATTARELLI (R), NEW JERSEY GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE: The closeness in my race and the closeness in the president's race last year were real eye-openers.\n\nMIKIE SHERRILL (D), NEW JERSEY GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE: I'm going to take on Donald Trump when it comes to our economy here in New Jersey.\n\nRADDATZ: This morning, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy and Democratic Senator Tim Kaine join us. We break down the latest results from our brand-new poll, two days before Election Day. And analysis from our powerhouse roundtable.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nANNOUNCER: This is a special edition of \"THIS WEEK,\" \"Your Voice, Your Vote 2025.\" Here now, Martha Raddatz.\n\nRADDATZ: Good morning and welcome to \"THIS WEEK.\"\n\nWe are just two days away from key election in several states across the country. Elections that will give us a sense of the nation's mood and potentially an early signal of what could come next in 2026 as Democrats seek to regain power in Washington after Trump's tumultuous return to office.\n\nAnd our new ABC News/\"Washington Post\"/Ipsos poll out this morning finds that the mood of the country is decidedly negative, with two-thirds of Americans saying the country is on the wrong track under President Trump. But that is an improvement from this same time last year under President Biden.\n\nThe economy is a major part of the current discontent, with more than six in ten Americans disapproving of how President Trump is handling the economy, as well as tariffs. And a similar share blaming him for the current rate of inflation. Overall, a majority of Americans disapproved of the president's handling of every issue we polled.\n\nAs for the Democrats, more Americans say the Democratic Party is out of touch with the concerns of most people in the U.S. today, than say the same about Trump and the Republican Party.\n\nAll of this comes as more Americans are starting to feel the fallout from the now month long government shutdown, which seems to have no end in sight.\n\nAnd that's where we start this morning with ABC's Jay O'Brien.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\nJAY O'BRIEN, ABC NEWS CORRESPONDENT (voice over): The government shutdown now on the brink of becoming the longest in U.S. history.\n\nMINORITY LEADER SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER: Republicans are living in fantasy, pretending as if the issue will fix itself.\n\nSPEAKER OF THE HOUSE REP. MIKE JOHNSON: The blame for this lies 100 percent with the senators sitting over there on the Democrat Party.\n\nO'BRIEN (voice over): But Americans seem to be more critical of the GOP. ABC's new poll with \"THE WASHINGTON POST\" and Ipsos finds 45 percent of Americans blame President Donald Trump and Republicans for the shutdown, while 33 percent say the same about Democrats.\n\nNo matter who is to blame, the pain is getting worse by the day. On Saturday, funding for SNAP federal food assistance drying up. The benefits halted for 42 million Americans.\n\nSYMONE WILKES, SNAP RECIPIENT: I'm already struggling.\n\nO'BRIEN (voice over): Simone Wilkes, a single working mother from Detroit, has two young boys and relies on SNAP. She's now looking at taking a second job.\n\nWILKES: It has been days where the kids will eat, and I'll just survive off water.\n\nO'BRIEN (voice over): The Trump administration reversing an earlier plan to use the Department of Agriculture's emergency funds to cover the program during a shutdown.\n\nBROOKE ROLLINS, AGRICULTURE SECRETARY: It is a contingency fund that can only flow if the underlying appropriation is approved.\n\nO'BRIEN (voice over): But on Friday, a federal judge ordering the administration must continue funding SNAP during the shutdown. President Trump responding, writing, he's instructed government lawyers to \"ask the court to clarify how we can legally fund SNAP as soon as possible.\"\n\nBut this worsening food crisis now on a collision course with the issue Democrats are holding firm to fix in this shutdown, looming, skyrocketing health care costs for some 20 million Americans insured through the Affordable Care Act. And with tax credits set to expire, enrollees, on average, set to see their premiums more than double.\n\nSTACY COX, ACA MARKETPLACE ENROLLEE: It's devastating. Just that bill right there, that's more than our mortgage, our insurance, most of our food.\n\nO'BRIEN (voice over): A month into this shutdown, more than 1.4 million federal workers are going without pay, including air traffic controllers. And this week, airports across the country reporting more of those tasked with keeping the skies safe are calling out sick, leading to staffing shortages and delayed flights, expected to only get worse.\n\nPETE LEFEVRE, AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLER: The prospect of going another pay period without pay is weighing on the minds of myself and all the people that I work with.\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\nO'BRIEN (on camera): And, Martha, several governors have now declared a state of emergency, trying to meet this surge in demand now that SNAP has been halted.\n\nMeantime, there's no end to this shutdown in sight. Democrats continue to withhold their votes on government funding, trying to compel Republicans to negotiate with them on health care. Republicans have said they won't do that while the government is shut down.\n\nMartha.\n\nRADDATZ: And for more on the impacts from this shutdown, including on air travel, I'm joined now by Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy.\n\nWe're so pleased to have you here this morning, Mr. Secretary.\n\nAmericans have experienced major delay. There's a ground stop this morning at Newark, all because air traffic controllers are calling in sick. The FAA is saying that \"currently, nearly 50 percent of major air traffic control facilities are experienced staffing shortages, and nearly 80 percent of air traffic controllers are out at New York-area facilities.\"\n\nWe know that safety is your greatest concern, but at some point, might you have to shut down portions of the U.S. airspace, maybe even airports? What point are we at, at that possibility?\n\nTRANSPORTATION SECRETARY SEAN DUFFY: Well, so, first off, I've been traveling around talking to air traffic controllers and there really is frustration. The fact that there's a shutdown right now. The Democrats are focusing on illegal healthcare, and, you know, we've endangered the SNAP beneficiaries, and they don't get paid as air traffic controllers. There's a burning frustration like in the rest of the country.\n\nAnd so, you mentioned that safety is my top priority. And it is. We will delay, we will cancel any kind of flight across the national airspace to make sure people are safe.\n\nBut there is a level of risk that gets injected into the system when we have a controller that's doing two jobs instead of one. We manage that. We look out for it. And safety is the priority.\n\nWe'll take all steps necessary, though, to make sure that you get from point A to point B and you do it safely.\n\nRADDATZ: And just again, how close are we to this point where you might have to close airspace or airports as we watch air traffic controllers calling in sick?\n\nDUFFY: Well, so, first off, if you look at other shutdowns, our air traffic controllers, God bless them, they've been coming to work. They're frustrated, but by and large, they've come. They're not getting paid.\n\nAnd so, I can't predict, Martha, what's going to happen in the future. But as each day goes on, and again, it's not -- you miss a paycheck, but every day you have expenses, food and gas, and then bills come in. Whether it's Netflix or, you know, your YouTube TV, the expenses continue to roll, and the pressure continues to grow.\n\nAnd the problem is, these controllers, a lot of them are new controllers or they're trainee controllers. They don't make a lot of money. And so, they may be the only person that is bringing money into the household. They have to make a decision, do I go to work and not get a paycheck and not put food on the table, or do I drive for Uber or DoorDash or wait tables? Those are the real thoughts and conversations these controllers are having.\n\nSo, as I look forward, I hope Democrats are going to come to their senses and open the government back up. But I would just tell you, as bad as it is, the numbers you just gave, this -- we will look back if -- if the government doesn't open in the next week or two, we'll look back as these were the good days, not the bad days. It's only going to get worse.\n\nAnd, Martha, just one other point on our controllers. We -- as I think you've reported, we have really old, antiquated air traffic control equipment. We have the most efficient and safe airspace, not because of the equipment, but because the great men and women who control the airspace, and we should treat them like the professionals that they are and pay them.\n\nRADDATZ: Well -- well, let's talk about that. The Trump administration this week paid service members by using $2.5 billion in housing funds from the so-called big, beautiful bill. Why haven't you done something similar with air traffic controllers?\n\nDUFFY: Yes, so we've looked throughout our -- our funding mechanisms to see how we could pull money in and -- and pay our controllers. We kept essential air service operational. We're paying our academy students at Oklahoma City. They get a stipend as they go through the academy.\n\nWe're pulling in whatever dollar we can, but there -- there's real restrictions. When you don't fund the government, when you say there's no dollars available, it becomes really challenging to find dollars to pay the different components of really critical workforces that keep our country moving forward.\n\nAnd again, it's simple. Democrats, open up the government, negotiate a deal, have a conversation, introduce a bill, debate it, vote on it, but shutting the government down is not the pathway forward, I think, to make sure you get your way and you get your will.\n\nRADDATZ: And, Mr. Secretary, I want to read from our poll. ABC's new poll with \"The Washington Post\" and Ipsos finds 44 percent of Americans blame Donald Trump and the Republicans for the shutdown, while 33 percent say the same about Democrats.\n\nSo, people are looking at this because the Republicans obviously have both houses of Congress and the White House and putting the blame on Republicans. So, what should Republicans be doing?\n\nDUFFY: Well, I think it's important to say in September, we -- Republicans said we should have the same funding levels in September as we do in October. We didn't change anything.\n\nAgain, you don't use shutdowns to pass bills. You don't hold the American people hostage. You don't hurt the American people to get leverage. And that's exactly what Democrats are doing right now because people are getting hurt.\n\nAnd again, whether you're traveling home to see your family or go to a funeral or a wedding or you're on a business trip, the hours that people are spending in airports, Democrats see that as leverage. And, this not the -- this is not the pathway to get your way or get your will.\n\nAnd I would just note, Martha, Donald Trump had a historic election. He won the popular vote. He won the seven swing states. Democrats roundly lost.\n\nAnd so now to say, \"I'm going to shut down the government to get my way, my will,\" I -- listen, you can't cave to that. Otherwise, you're going to have a shutdown every -- every third month.\n\nAnd so again, the polling is one thing, but the process is another.\n\nRADDATZ: And let's talk about the process and President Trump's role. Demo -- you say Democrats have to come to the table. Republicans have not been negotiating. And Scott Bessent told me just a week ago he think -- he thinks it would be a waste of time for Donald Trump to hold another meeting.\n\nBack in 2011, when Donald Trump was considering a run for president, this is what he said about Barack Obama as a shutdown loomed. Let's listen.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP, 2011)\n\nINTERVIEWER: So, how would you do it now? Now, you're in the Oval Office right now --\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nDONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I would get everybody together and we'd have a budget --\n\nINTERVIEWER: They've all gotten together.\n\nTRUMP: Well, that's because they don't have the right leader. You don't have the right leader. This is the president of the United States has to get this done.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nRADDATZ: And he went on to say, \"The president is the one that has to get people together, and it would be a tremendously negative mark on the president if they couldn't get it done.\" What's your reaction to that?\n\nDUFFY: Well, I'll just tell you that Barack Obama said, \"I'm not going to be blackmailed. I'm not going to be held hostage. This is not the way you negotiate a deal. You lost the election, Republicans,\" that's what Barack Obama said. \"Go through the process.\"\n\nAnd I think that's the right philosophy right now. And again --\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRADDATZ: Should President Trump -- given what he said, should President Trump be meeting? Would you like to see him hold another meeting?\n\nDUFFY: So, here -- here's the problem -- Donald Trump has nothing to negotiate with. We passed a clean funding bill, right? So, what do you negotiate with when you -- again money in September, same as October.\n\nDemocrats are trying to use this as leverage and again trying to change legislation that they don't like. But again, the changes they want to make want to fund healthcare for illegal migrants. That doesn't make sense to Republicans.\n\nIf you want to have a conversation, let's have it. The healthcare funding doesn't end until the end of the year. So why are you shutting the government down in October when you could have a conversation for three months until the end of the year?\n\nI think this doesn't make any sense. I think Democrats are angry. They're playing to the left-wing side of their base. Most commonsense Democrats, I think, would say, \"Open it up and negotiate, pass bills, debate it.\"\n\nBut this is not the approach on how you pass legislation.\n\nRADDATZ: Okay, thanks so much for joining us, and we'll let Tim Kaine respond to what you just said. Thanks so much.\n\nDUFFY: Thanks, Martha.\n\nRADDATZ: And I'm joined now by Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia.\n\nGood morning, Senator.\n\nI know you heard Secretary Duffy there talking about the onus is on the Democrats, and that you are fighting to get legal health care for immigrants.\n\nSEN. TIM KAINE, (D) VIRGINIA: Well, I just got to say, Martha, that's a lie. The healthcare battle is not about healthcare for illegal immigrants, and Sean Duffy knows it. It's about millions of Americans who, in the last few weeks, have gotten premium increase notices that tell them that Donald Trump's Big, Beautiful Bill is delivering them big, ugly health insurance bills within the next few weeks unless we can find a fix.\n\nAnd so, what we're taking for is, let's find a path to a fix and let's also have President Trump finally engage in the negotiation and guarantee that a deal is a deal. If we shake hands on a deal for 30 days or for three months, he won't immediately start firing more people, clawing back economic development projects, going after blue states or blue cities, and allowing funds to be used in red cities.\n\nSo, look, we're looking for a path to fix people's health care costs, and we're looking for the president to agree that a deal is a deal. Thus far he's refused to engage, and we avoid shutdowns or get it out -- get out of shutdowns all the time when the president engages.\n\nRADDATZ: So -- so, Senator, it has been 33 days. Democrats chose not to support that short term CR, which would have kept the government open. You could have negotiated. Now there's some pretty devastating impacts on -- on people looking at -- for SNAP, on air traffic controllers, on air travel. So, what have the Democrats gained from this?\n\nKAINE: Well, I don't look at this as politics. I mean the president told the House, do a budget and, in his words, don't deal with Democrats. So, Senate Democrats put an alternative on the table 12 days before September 30 that fixed the health care wreckage that the Republicans caused and that ensured that a deal would be honored, both by Congress and the White House. The president refused to meet until the day before the deadline. He had Democrats in the Oval Office. And as soon as they walked out, he put up an A.I.-generated video of them wearing sombreros and talking in A.I.-generated fake voices saying they didn't say. The guy's unserious. He's willing to give $20 billion --\n\nRADDATZ: But -- but serious --\n\nKAINE: Hold on. He's been willing to give $20 billion to the Argentinians and meet with them, wreck the White House, have a Great Gatsby party down at Mar-a-Lago. He has not done what he said needed to be done in 2011, sit down with Democratic leadership. If he (INAUDIBLE) --\n\nRADDATZ: Senator, I just want to go back to the --\n\nKAINE: Leadership, this thing (ph) will be resolved in a matter of hours.\n\nRADDATZ: OK. Excuse me. I just want to go back to what Democrats have gotten during this period. Not talking about politics. What have Democrats gained during this period? And how long can this last?\n\nKAINE: I -- you know, Martha, I'm a United States Senator. And I -- yes, I run as a Democrat, and I'm a Democrat, but I just don't approach my work that way. So, when you ask what Democrats have gained, what we're -- what we're focused on is the American people. We want President Trump to stop firing people, canceling economic development projects. We want them to stop raising everybody's costs. You know, health care costs, energy costs, housing costs. Halloween's more expensive. Thanksgiving is more expensive. The holidays are going to be more expensive.\n\nSo, we're asking the president to simply sit down and do what all presidents do. We can find a budget deal that puts us on a path to a health care fix. I don't need all the i's dotted and t's crossed. I just want to be on a path so that people's bills don't spike, and I want the president to agree, stop the wrecking ball. Stop the mass firings and the cancellations of projects you don't like.\n\nAnd I think Americans understand that. And that's why they look at Donald Trump's lack of engagement and overwhelmingly say that he's really more to blame for this.\n\nRADDATZ: We just have a couple of minutes here, but you recently said things are coming together. There are reportedly conversations among rank-and-file senators to try to reach -- to negotiate the reopening of the government for a few weeks. Is that going on right now? Are you part of those discussions?\n\nKAINE: I would say, Martha, I'm sort of at the edge of them. There is a group of people talking about these two issues, a path to fix the health care debacle and a guarantee that if we reopen government, I'm calling it a moratorium on mischief. If we agree to reopen, President Trump's got to stop the firings.\n\nThe FAA, we're talking air traffic control, they've forced 2,400 people out of the FAA during Trump's first year, when they were already short 3,000 air traffic controllers. Stop the firings, stop the games playing, stop going after blue cities and helping red cities. Let's have a moratorium on mischief during whatever this period is. Get on a path to fix people's health care. If the president engages, we will be -- we will find a deal, I think, within hours.\n\nRADDATZ: And, Senator, just quickly, if you can, you're there in Virginia. Virginia holds key elections on Tuesday. Are you confident the Democrats can sweep this?\n\nKAINE: I feel really good about it, Martha. And here's why. In Virginia, we are the best red to blue turnaround in the country in the last 25 years. And the way we've done it is by focusing on the economy. Abigail Spanberger, our candidate, three pillars to her campaign, affordability, jobs, and education, which is about kids, but also about our workforce. Her opponent is running ads on offbeat cultural issues that don't really matter to the most people. In Virginia, Democrats focus on the economy, winning the economic argument, delivering economic results. And that's why the state has moved from red to blue so dramatically since 2000.\n\nRADDATZ: OK. Thanks so much. Good to see you this morning, Senator. Appreciate your time.\n\nKAINE: Thanks, Martha. Good to be with you.\n\nRADDATZ: Up next, our report from New Jersey, looking at what's driving voters there ahead of Tuesday's critical elections. Plus, Rick Klein breaks down the races from New York City to Virginia to California. We're back in two minutes.\n\nBARACK OBAMA, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: We need leaders who will tell the truth and who will take responsibility and tackle hard problems and bring people together instead of tearing them apart. We need leaders who won't serve bosses in Washington or big corporate donors, but instead will serve the people who put them there.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nRADDATZ: Former President Barack Obama hitting the campaign trail this weekend in Virginia and New Jersey. Tuesday's elections in several states will be a critical test of where the country stands one year after returning Donald Trump to the White House, and a potential signal on whether Democrats have a chance to re-take Congress one year from now. So ahead of Tuesday's final voting, we look at how both sides are making their closing arguments to voters.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\nABIGAIL SPANBERGER (D), VIRGINIA GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE: Virginia, are you fired up?\n\nRADDATZ (voice-over): From the high-stakes gubernatorial races in Virginia and New Jersey, to the contentious mayor's race in New York City, and California's consequential redistricting measure that Governor Gavin Newsom is counting on --\n\nGOV. GAVIN NEWSOM (D), CALIFORNIA: We're going to meet the moment not just with rhetoric, but through action.\n\nRADDATZ (voice-over): For Democrats, this will be their first try at redemption since President Donald Trump's re-election.\n\nIn Virginia, moderate Democrat Abigail Spanberger, a former CIA officer and congresswoman, has maintained a modest lead over Republican nominee, Winsome Earle-Sears, the state's current lieutenant governor.\n\nZOHRAN MAMDANI (D), NEW YORK CITY MAYORAL CANDIDATE: New York is not for sale.\n\nRADDATZ (voice-over): And in New York, progressive Zohran Mamdani holds a substantial lead over his opponent including former governor Andrew Cuomo running as an independent. But it is New Jersey that could hold the biggest challenge for Democrats, where moderate congresswoman and former Navy helicopter pilot, Mikie Sherrill's lead is anything but certain.\n\nWe met up with her in Asbury Park between campaign events, where her message is clear.\n\nREP. MIKIE SHERRILL (D), NEW JERSEY GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE: I'm going to fight incredibly hard for families, for kids to get costs down, and I'm going to take on Donald Trump when it comes to our economy here in New Jersey.\n\nRADDATZ (voice-over): But the historically blue state has moved to the right in recent years. Former vice president Kamala Harris won New Jersey by just six points last November, down 10 points from former President Joe Biden's lead in 2020.\n\nRADDATZ: What happened in New Jersey for that right turn in 2024 (ph)?\n\nSHERRILL: I think New Jersey is really representative of what's going on in America. We have a lot of middle class voters who are looking at their costs go up year after year after year, and who felt as if nobody was hearing them. And so, they decided to take a chance on a Trump administration because Trump promised to lower their cost.\n\nUnfortunately, he has done anything but. We've seen costs skyrocket here.\n\nRADDATZ (voice-over): Republican nominee and former assemblyman, Jack Ciattarelli, came close to the governor's mansion last election, losing to Governor Phil Murphy by just three points.\n\nJACK CIATTARELLI, (R) NEW JERSEY GUBERNATORIAL NOMINEE: This is very different from 2021. I'm not running against an incumbent and there's a lot less indifference this time around, not only inside New Jersey, but around the country. The closeness of my race and the closeness of the president's race last year were real eye openers.\n\nRADDATZ (voice-over): The Trump administration's decision to withhold congressionally approved funds for the Gateway Tunnel Project, connecting New York to New Jersey, has faced major blowback.\n\nCIATTARELLLI: He's playing hard ball negotiation tactics with a very uncooperative Democratic Party. By the way, my opponent, if she feels that seriously about the Gateway Project, then vote yes and reopen up the government.\n\nRADDATZ (voice-over): Down in Pennsville Township, we met Bishop Kendon Gibson, a former Democrat-turned-independent who voted for Trump in 2024 because of the economy.\n\nBISHOP KENDON GIBSON, NEW JERSEY VOTER: I voted for policy, change, lowering taxes.\n\nRADDATZ (voice-over): But this election, he's voting blue.\n\nGIBSON: I think that Mikie Sherrill is more for the people, the working people. I think that the Democrats deserve another chance.\n\nRADDATZ (voice-over): When you look at the progressive side of the Democratic Party and the moderate side, what do you wish the Democrats would do?\n\nGIBSON: I think we could have gotten more aggressive with healthcare because now we're stuck with a shutdown and we have to use that as leverage when we could have, you know, really protected Obamacare.\n\nRADDATZ (voice-over): Not all New Jersey voters we spoke to felt the shutdown mattered in this race.\n\nKELSEY ANTHONY, NEW JERSEY VOTER: I think people's minds are sort of made up. Either you think it's a Republican's fault or you think it's a Democrat's fault.\n\nRADDATZ (voice-over): Born and raised in New Jersey, lawyer and Ciattarelli campaign volunteer Kelsey Anthony already cast her ballot.\n\nANTHONY: I am a mom. I have two young children, and I believe that the public education system, specifically funding of the public education system, is broken in New Jersey. The school funding has been completely disproportionate around the state. And Jack has stated that he's going to fix that.\n\nRADDATZ (voice-over): And she knows this race is close.\n\nANTHONY: Generally, New Jersey has many more Democrats than it does Republicans, but I think that right now, the state of the state is not good. And I think that the last eight years have been really telling. And the current administration has really done a number on a lot of New Jersey families. And I think that if there was ever a time for change, it's going to be now.\n\nRADDATZ (voice-over): Over in Princeton, New Jersey, Democrat Chris Johnson voted early for Sherrill but isn't very excited about her candidacy.\n\nCHRIS JOHNSON, NEW JERSEY VOTER: There really was only one option, which is to vote for the Democratic Party. But to be honest, it feels to me a little bit like picking the least worst option. And the fact that we did put so much effort into canvassing and getting the word out and making the phone calls and it was that close in the presidential election and then even in the prior gubernatorial election is worrisome. You know, I think New Jersey is much more purple than people realize.\n\nRADDATZ (voice-over): He says Democrats need to focus less on Trump.\n\nJOHNSON: There's been far too much of an emphasis on continuing to run against Trump and not focusing on what they are going to do with their own messaging, their own platform to improve the lives of people. You know, I think running an ad saying, \"Hey, I'm a mom and I'm a helicopter pilot, so therefore vote for me\", that's not a winning message.\n\nBut we want to drill down a little deeper right now. Our Washington Bureau chief Rick Klein is here now with the breakdown of what to look for around the country on Election Day.\n\nAnd, Rick, good morning. Let's start with those two marquee governor's races.\n\nRICK KLEIN, ABC NEWS WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF: Yeah. Good morning, Martha.\n\nVirginia and New Jersey, of course, both relatively blue states. So, Democrats losing either one of them would send a big message, but even if Democrats sweep on Tuesday, we're going to see how much the political winds have shifted since last year.\n\nIf you look at the polls in New Jersey, where you just spent some time on the ground, the Democrat Mikie Sherrill with a narrow but pretty consistent lead over her opponent Jack Ciattarelli. As you mentioned, Ciattarelli came close to winning the governor's race back in 2021, but it is still a heavily Democratic state. It's worth noting nearly every part of the state has shifted to the right between 2020 and 2024, particularly, you see this trend in North Jersey where large numbers of Black and Hispanic voters in particular reflected a national trend of voting Republican a year ago, far more than they have in recent elections.\n\nThe question Tuesday, Martha, is whether those voters show up again and vote Republican, or if Democrats have some momentum back with them now that Trump is in the White\n\nKLEIN: Yeah. In Virginia, the state has been trending Democratic over the last couple of decades. And if recent polls hold, the Democrat, Abigail Spanberger, is poised to defeat the Republican, Winsome Earle-Sears. She's the current Lieutenant Governor of the state. Now, that wouldn't come as a surprise. In governor's races, the state almost always votes against the party in the White House, including in 2021 when Governor Glenn Youngkin won just a year after President Biden was elected.\n\nRADDATZ: And Rick, let's not forget New York City, New York City's preparing for one of the most consequential elections in the city's history.\n\nKLEIN: Yeah, and this could easily be the biggest story coming out of Tuesday night. Polls show Zohran Mamdani, the 34-year-old self-described Democratic socialist, well ahead of his opponents. And what's striking here is how much interest has been in this election. Almost 600,000 New Yorkers have already cast their ballots in early voting. That has already smashed the record for a mayoral election in New York.\n\nMamdani represents generational as well as ideological change. National Republicans are actually probably even more eager than Democrats to see him rise to prominence, given his calls for higher taxes on corporations and the wealthy, and his past calls which he has since reversed, to defund the police.\n\nRADDATZ: We certainly have seen him reverse those. And finally, Rick, Democrats are counting on California to approve new congressional maps on Tuesday.\n\nKLEIN: Yeah, Martha, we've seen this highly unusual redistricting nationwide, all of these states either considering or already have adopted new maps. This is Democrats' biggest chance to swing back at the Republican advantage. Until now, it has been all Republican. The new maps that have passed at President Trump's urgings in states, including Texas and Missouri, North Carolina, Ohio, those moves could net Republicans as many as nine more seats in the midterms next year.\n\nBut Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom, he pushed through a new map that could net his party up to five additional seats. This is what the map would look like. The number of Republicans would go down potentially from nine to four. And if voters make that a reality on Tuesday, it's a big, big change. Although, even if it passes, it's worth noting, Republicans are likely to get a lot more out of redistricting than Democrats.\n\nIt looks like they'll get a handful of seats at least, out of this in an election where the balance of power just could not be tighter next year, Martha.\n\nRADDATZ: And they will no doubt be trying to do that. Our Washington Bureau Chief, Rick Klein, thanks so much.\n\nUp next, our Business Correspondent, Elizabeth Schulze takes a deeper dive into how the economy could impact Tuesday's vote. And later, our Powerhouse Roundtable.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nRADDATZ: In our new ABC News/\"Washington Post\"/Ipsos poll, some 52 percent of Americans say the economy has gotten worse since Donald Trump took office. Nearly double the 27 percent who say it has improved.\n\nABC's Elizabeth Schulze takes a closer look at why the economy is front and center in voters' minds.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\nELIZABETH SCHULZE, ABC NEWS CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Nearly a year since Donald Trump's economic pitch to voters helped propel his return to the White House --\n\nDONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We will rapidly drive prices down and make America affordable again.\n\nSCHULZE (voice over): A tale of two economies emerging.\n\nTRUMP: We're doing numbers that nobody's ever seen before.\n\nZOHRAN MAMDANI, (D) NEW YORK MAYORAL NOMINEE: This is the most expensive city in the United States of America, and it's time to make it affordable.\n\nSCHULZE (voice over): On paper, the U.S. economy is humming along, growth is solid, unemployment remains near historic lows, and the stock market keeps hitting records. But prices are also increasing, and economists say President Trump's tariffs are a key reason why.\n\nJEROME POWELL, FEDERAL RESERVE CHAIR: There will be some additional increased inflation because it takes a while for tariffs to work their way through the -- through the production chain.\n\nSCHULZE (voice over): In the past year, prices are up for most basic essentials. The latest government inflation report shows utility bills are up 12 percent in one year. Electricity bills up 5 percent, day care costs up 5 percent, rent up 3.5 percent, and food prices up 3 percent.\n\nJULIE LUSENI, CLINICAL TECHNICIAN: Everything has gone up. Everything.\n\nSCHULZE (voice over): We spent an afternoon with Julie Luseni, a clinical technician at a hospital, and single mom of three in Virginia, who's struggling to keep food on the table. After paying for groceries, bills, and rent, Julie says she only has $100 left until she receives her next paycheck.\n\nLUSENI: It's really tough, to the point that like even when school is about to start, my kids will literally just have either two pair of shoes for like the whole year.\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\nSCHULZE (on camera): And, Martha, this really is a tale of two economies. The top 10 percent of households account for almost half of all consumer spending right now, in many ways propping up the broader economy. And those cost of living concerns don't appear to be going anywhere, with the typical household now spending $208 more per month on the same goods and services than they were at this time last year.\n\nThe roundtable takes on Tuesday's elections and the shutdown stalemate when we come back.\n\nRADDATZ: And the roundtable's all here. Former DNC chair Donna Brazile, former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, and author and journalist, Molly Ball.\n\nGood to see all of you.\n\nAnd, Chris, I want to get right to you. Former governor of New Jersey, talk about this race in New Jersey and what you're seeing with Mikie Sherrill.\n\nCHRIS CHRISTIE, (R) FORMER NEW JERSEY GOVERNOR & ABC NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Look, Martha, this is a really tough state for my party. Give you context. We've elected one Republican United States senator in the last 50 years, one Republican governor in the last 25 years.\n\nAnd let me tell you, when I got -- when I ran, there was no road map for how to win New Jersey as a Republican in the 21st century. No one had done it. But we've laid the path for Jack Ciattarelli.\n\nThis is what he's going to have to do to beat Mike Sherrill -- 70 percent of the white vote, 21 percent of the black vote. We won 51 percent of the Hispanic vote. We beat a female candidate, as he is running against this time, by 15 points. And we won 58 percent of independents.\n\nWith 850,000 more Democrats than Republicans, that's what you need to do.\n\nSo, the question for him on Tuesday night is, can he hit those numbers?\n\nThose are the numbers you have to hit to win in a state like New Jersey. The path has been laid out. We'll see what he can do.\n\nRADDATZ: You think he can do it?\n\nCHRISTIE: I -- look, I think it's possible because the one other thing that's going on here, Martha, is Democrat excitement is not way up there regarding Mikie Sherrill. What you see happening is there's anger towards Donald Trump among Democrats. Will that translate into votes for Mikie Sherrill?\n\nRADDATZ: And, Donna, let's talk about the Democrats and in Virginia as well. What are you seeing in both races? Do you see Mikie Sherrill taking this and Spanberger in Virginia?\n\nDONNA BRAZILE, FORMER DNC CHAIR & ABC NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, you know, New Jersey is seen as -- the electorate at least is seen as very -- is like elastic. Everybody thinks you can stretch it. Donald Trump came within six points. In 2020, Joe Biden beat Trump by 16 percentage points. Kamala Harris only beat him by six points. The Republicans made significant inroads in New Jersey, Chris.\n\nAnd I remember on election night a year ago, that at 10:45, I looked at him, and I said, \"What the hell is going on in Passaic County?\" I mean, I know New Jersey. And I was like, \"Chris, what's happening?\" Because Trump was shifting the electorate.\n\nMikie Sherrill had two main challenges. One, she's dealing with a relatively unpopular governor, so she had to become her own candidate. I think she's done a fantastic job, you know, talking about her past in the Navy, talking about being a prosecutor. I think she has made up a lot of difference and the enthusiasm is there.\n\nIn Virginia, there's no question. Early voting is really good for Democrats, but as you know, same day Republicans can make up a lot of ground.\n\nSo, I'm optimistic on both sides.\n\nRADDATZ: You really think the enthusiasm is there for Sherrill? Because you -- I didn't get a sense of that up there from some of those voters.\n\nBRAZILE: Look, right now, people are not in love with politics. They're not in love with anybody. They're so angry about the affordability crisis.\n\nThat's why I think what the congresswoman is doing and you know, \"Drive Down the Cost\" bus tour. She's really getting Democrats excited and I do believe that she has a slight chance of winning.\n\nRADDATZ: And, Molly, the other thing that Sherrill is doing is talking about Donald Trump nonstop. That -- she's obviously talking about the economy, a big deal, but Donald Trump, Donald Trump. She's running against Donald Trump.\n\nMOLLY BALL, POLITICAL REPORT AND AUTHOR & FORMER WALL STREET JOURNAL SENIOR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: Because if there is any enthusiasm in the Democratic base, that is what it is for. It's the millions of people coming out for the \"No Kings\" protests. It's the people telling pollsters that they're excited to vote in the midterms next year. It's the overwhelming turnout we've seen in the special elections here and there over the past year.\n\nThe enthusiasm in the Democratic base is an anti-Trump enthusiasm. And so, that's what I think you see both Sherrill and Spanberger trying to tap into in order to try to get their base out.\n\nIt is, I think, though, a missed opportunity for both of these women, both of whom are sort of moderate, centrist, establishment Democrats. They've run very safe campaigns. And what they haven't done is really lay down a marker for their vision for the future of the Democratic Party -- a vision that is not the vision of a Zohran Mamdani, a vision that is much more I think they would say sort of unifying and centrist. And they haven't really articulated what that would mean for the party to go in that direction.\n\nRADDATZ: And, Chris, I want to get back to -- to the governor's races in particular. Donald Trump is not going to be out there on the campaign trail, and the base certainly wants to see Donald Trump and pulled out a lot of voters.\n\nWhen you look at the polling and you know how far New Jersey has lurched to the right, talk about that change and how that happened and what they do without a Donald Trump.\n\nCHRISTIE: Look, I think the move to the right in New Jersey was based on two things. One, it was a rejection of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. I think they came in arguing that they were going to make the country more civil, more centrist, and in fact, they went very far to the left. And that angered the most important voters in New Jersey, Martha, the independents.\n\nThere are more independents than there are Democrats or Republicans in New Jersey, and you have to play to them. Secondly, it's affordability. And we've heard everybody talking about that, and that's a problem as well. The problem for Republicans is that Trump in New Jersey is anywhere right now from 12 to 15 points underwater.\n\nAnd Jack Ciattarelli has made his association with the president a big part of his campaign. So, those two things are in conflict, right? So what I'd say to you, Martha, is it's winnable for Jack Ciattarelli. Can he go out and mobilize the voters he needs to do it? If he does, he can win; if he doesn't, Mikie Sherrill will win.\n\nRADDATZ: And Molly talked about Mamdani. Donna, when you look at this race on Tuesday, if Mamdani wins, which he is projected to do, and Sherrill and Spanberger win, more moderates, what does that say about where the Democratic Party is and what does it say where you'll be next year with the midterms?\n\nBRAZILE: Well, first of all, in addition to the great city of New York, we have Detroit who will likely elect a female mayor. We also have Cleveland, Miami. So we have lots of elections, also in the state of Pennsylvania with Supreme Court Justice races and of course, California with that big redistricting bill.\n\nI think it is going to say to the Democrats, who have won a lot of special elections this year, that we have to be more organized, more focused, more organic. We have to speak in the now language, not the 20th century language. And if Democrats can engage voters year round, I think Democrats have a chance of coming back in 2026.\n\nCHRISTIE: Martha, can I just say? It will be generational. I think what's going on in New York is less about ideology than it is generational.\n\nBRAZILE: Yeah.\n\nCHRISTIE: In the Democratic primary, you ran, no disrespect to me, a lot of old white guys in the primary against Zohran Mamdani. He stood out in the way he communicated and how he appealed, less about his message I think than about that generational change. And I think Democrats need to look at that.\n\nRADDATZ: And Molly, I want to also talk about this shutdown and what effect that has. Nothing's going to happen until the government opens up again. And you heard everybody this morning, Senator Kaine and Duffy -- Secretary Duffy talk about this. Where is it? Senator Kaine mentioned kind of that there might be some progress.\n\nBALL: Well, the progress is all, as you said to Senator Kaine, it's all among the rank and file. The leaders still are not talking to each other. And nothing, as you know, happens in Congress until the leaders talk to one another. I do hear from my sources on Capitol Hill that they think there's a possibility for a breakthrough after the election on Tuesday. That that might be the impetus for people to try to come together in some way.\n\nBut this has been the strangest shutdown because there is just no urgency there. It's gone on for so long. It's starting to affect people. We see in the polling, Americans are not happy with it. They don't like shutdowns. But it just has not been the sort of consuming story that would light a fire under people. And even in this new polling that we have, we see that the numbers haven't really budged.\n\nPeople blame the Republicans slightly more, but that's not changing. There's no momentum for one side or the other. And so, I just think you have two sides that are so dug in and neither of them really sees any reason to come to the table and resolve it.\n\nBRAZILE: I miss the gangs. The Gang of Six, the Gang of Eight. They normally would come in at the last minute and pull things together. We need those gangs to come back, those gangs of leaders.\n\nRADDATZ: And maybe they will, because I think next week will be pretty bad, as Secretary Duffy pointed out, maybe that will be the catalyst. Thanks to all of you.\n\nUp next, President Trump says the U.S. will resume nuclear weapons testing. Senator Ed Markey warns that could lead to a new nuclear arms race. I'll speak with him when we come back.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: Are you talking about literally resuming underground nuclear detonation tests?\n\nDONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: You'll find out very soon, but we're going to do some testing. Yes. Other countries do it. If they're going to do it, we're going to do it.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: But can -- you can't clarify whether we'll resume --\n\nTRUMP: I'm not going to say yet. I'm going to know exactly what we're doing, where we're doing it, but other countries are doing it and if other countries do it, we do it.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nRADDATZ: President Trump on Friday responding to questions about his call for the U.S. to resume nuclear testing.\n\nI'm joined now by Senator Ed Markey. He's the founder of the National Nuclear Freeze Movement and has been working to end proliferation of nuclear weapons since the beginning of his career. And he has introduced legislation to stop renewed nuclear testing.\n\nIt's good to see you this morning, Senator Markey. The president was quite clear midweek that he wants to resume nuclear testing and to keep up with those who are doing it. The U.S. hasn't had a test since '92. North Korea was the last to test a nuclear weapon in 2017.\n\nWhat do you think he's talking about, and what will happen?\n\nSEN. ED MARKEY (D-MA): Well, first, he's wrong. Other countries are not engaging in nuclear testing. The Russians, the Chinese, they have not tested since at least 1996, when the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty was put into effect. And it would be a gift to China, it would be a gift to Russia. Chinese have only tested 45 times. We've tested more than a thousand times. So it would give them an ability to catch up to us with the sophistication of their nuclear weapons technology.\n\nWhat I think he's responding to is the announcement by Putin that they are testing missile delivery systems for nuclear bombs. That's a different subject altogether. And the reason that Russia, the reason that China is developing new missile delivery systems is that the United States pulled out of the anti-ballistic missile system. It is because Donald Trump has announced that he is going to deploy a golden dome over our country.\n\nThousands of satellites with interceptors on them to knock down incoming Russian or Chinese missiles, with nuclear bombs on them. And that has led those countries to develop more and more sophisticated nuclear missiles to circumvent the boondoggle, which will be the golden dome, which our own experts say will not work. It will be a golden sieve, which will allow ultimately for enough nuclear weapons to penetrate it to destroy cities across our country and kill at least 100 million people.\n\nSo Donald Trump and Trumpatomics is going to make our country less safe, it's going to make the world less dangerous, and the only way to avoid it is to go to a negotiating table, for Donald Trump to accept the invitation from Putin, to extend the New START Treaty which expires in 100 days, and to then put all of these other weapons systems, offensive and defensive, on the table for negotiations. And that's the only way we're going to make our country and the world safer.\n\nRADDATZ: And Senator Markey, on the show last week, we talked about a new film called \"A House of Dynamite\" by Director Kathryn Bigelow, depicts what might happen if a nuclear missile came to the U.S. was launched toward the U.S.\n\nAnd there's a line in the movie that says, it's a coin toss, whether we could intercept it. The Pentagon apparently has some problems with that, saying we've been a hundred percent successful in a memo that was leaked to Bloomberg. Your response to that quickly, if you can.\n\nMARKEY: That's inaccurate. Our own missile defense system, our own missile defense agency says that we're only effective 50 percent of the time and that's in ideal conditions. That's not with decoys, that's not with other means that would try to misdirect our interceptors from knocking down incoming missiles with nuclear warheads on them. So that's completely erroneous.\n\nWhat the movie says -- what the movie \"House of Dynamite\" is giving us as a Cassandra-like warning is that defense systems do not work against offensive weapons with nuclear warheads on those delivery systems. And the only way to avoid that catastrophic moment, that Armageddon-like moment is to sit down at the negotiating table in order to get agreements with other countries on a verifiable basis to make sure that we do not make the world more dangerous.\n\nThat's what Donald Trump's Golden Dome is doing. That's what the United States' pulling out of the ABM Treaty has done.\n\nRADDATZ: Senator, I'm going to have to stop you there, but we appreciate your time this morning. Thank you. We'll be right back.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nRADDATZ: And thanks for sharing part of your Sunday with us. And be sure to tune in for full election coverage Tuesday night, streaming on \"ABC News Live.\"",

        "title": "7 big questions hang over US politics heading into Election Day 2025",
        "description": "Proposition 50 sparks debate over redistricting in California. It will play a substantial role in deciding which party controls the U.S. House.\n\nDemocrats are trying to bounce back from their 2024 thumping, while Republicans are working to blunt the typical momentum for the party out of power as voters hit the polls Nov. 4 for contests that will offer a window into the mood of the electorate nearly a year after President Donald Trump won his second term.\n\nThe off-year races in New Jersey, Virginia, California, New York City and elsewhere are seen as key early barometers of how voters are feeling about Trump and the Democratic Party as it fights his aggressive agenda.\n\nThe president has loomed large over the contests, featuring in ads and as a frequent topic in debates as Democrats blast his record and Republicans embrace it. Trump is paying close attention, hyping GOP candidates on social media and taking aim at their opponents.\n\nThe 2025 elections include a pair of races for governor and other down-ballot seats in New Jersey and Virginia, a high-profile ballot measure in California, state Supreme Court retention elections in Pennsylvania and mayoral contests around the country, most notably in New York City.\n\nThe elections are a precursor to more consequential midterm contests next year, when control of Congress - and with it the fate of Trump's legislative agenda - will be decided. The results on Nov. 4 will be highly scrutinized to see which party has the upper hand heading into next November's midterms. Here are seven big questions surrounding the elections:\n\nWho has the momentum?\n\nNew Jersey and Virginia haven't voted for a Republican president in a couple decades, but they can still be swingy in governor's races and these contests have signaled what's to come in the midterms.\n\nThe party that doesn't occupy the White House tends to do well in these governors' races, with that dynamic then carrying over to the midterms.\n\nIt happened in 2009 under President Barack Obama when Republicans won both gubernatorial races, in 2017 under Trump when Democrats won them both, and in 2021 under President Joe Biden when the GOP won the governor's mansion in Virginia and came close in New Jersey.\n\nDemocrats are favored to win both gubernatorial races this year, so a GOP upset in either state would be a bad sign for the party currently locked out of power in Washington. A small margin of victory by Democrats in one or both races also could signal trouble. Republicans are particularly focused on New Jersey, where Trump substantially narrowed his losing margin in 2024 and the GOP candidate is polling better than in Virginia.\n\nWill California check Trump's redistricting moves?\n\nCalifornia's election revolves around Trump and which party holds control of Congress.\n\nThe state's Proposition 50 ballot measure is a direct response by Democrats, led by Gov. Gavin Newsom, to the president's push to redraw congressional maps in several red states.\n\nAfter Texas drew five more GOP-leaning seats, Newsom pressed California lawmakers to offset the move by drawing more Democratic-leaning seats. To do it, they'll need approval from voters to temporarily go around the state's independent redistricting commission established by an earlier ballot initiative in 2010.\n\nThe redistricting tussle has huge implications. Trump is coaxing a more GOP-friendly midterm map from red state leaders out of concern that a Democrat-led House during his final two years in the White House would stymie his agenda and open the door to investigations, oversight and perhaps even a third impeachment. But California could offset much of Trump's efforts in the other states.\n\nWill Newsom 2028 get a boost?\n\nApproval of Proposition 50 also would be a big win for Newsom, who has been the face of the campaign and one of Trump's chief antagonists.\n\nNewsom recently said he's considering a run for president in 2028. He has been forceful in taking on Trump, playing to Democrats' desire for a fighter to confront a president many view as authoritarian.\n\nChecking the president's redistricting power play could further endear Newsom to Democrats by boosting his status as one of Trump's most high-profile nemesis, a coveted title in a wide-open Democratic presidential primary that could feature former Vice President Kamala Harris, former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker.\n\nDoes anti-Trump messaging work again?\n\nDemocrats again are making opposition to Trump central to their campaigns.\n\nThe message fires up the party's base, helping Democrats win control of Congress in 2018 and claim the White House in 2020, but there are questions about whether attacking Trump is a successful strategy with the broader electorate going forward. Trump won every swing state in 2024, along with the popular vote, and made gains with key groups of voters, including minorities and young people.\n\nThe Democrats running for governor in Virginia and New Jersey are emphasizing cost-of-living issues and other concerns that continue to be top of mind for voters, and tying those issues to Trump. The election may provide insight into whether they can find an approach to taking on the president that resonates.\n\nAre Trump's policies backfiring?\n\nTrump's aggressive second-term agenda has thrilled his supporters, but Democrats are hoping many voters see it as overreach.\n\nThe biggest test may be in Virginia, which is home to many federal workers impacted by the government shutdown and efforts by the Department of Government Efficiency to slash agencies. The shutdown will break the record for the longest in U.S. history if it extends past Election Day.\n\nVirginia elected a Republican governor, Glenn Youngkin, in 2021 and Trump halved his losing margin in the state between 2020 and 2024, hopeful signs for the GOP gubernatorial nominee Winsome Earle-Sears. A strong showing by Democrats could signal broader discontent with the extent of the president's efforts to transform government.\n\nShutdown politics are also factoring into the New Jersey governor's race after Trump paused funding for a tunnel between New York and New Jersey.\n\nWhither Democrats?\n\nThe Democratic Party's ideological divisions are on full display in the 2025 races, which feature more moderate candidates for governor in New Jersey and Virginia, along with a far-left front-runner for mayor of New York City.\n\nDemocratic socialist Zohran Mamdani is leading in the New York mayoral race with promises of aggressive government intervention to bring down costs, prompting Trump to lash out and threaten to withhold funds from the city if he wins. Meanwhile, Abigail Spanberger in Virginia and Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey are leaning on their backgrounds of government service, Spanberger in the CIA and Sherrill in the Navy, as they run for governor.\n\nAs the party continues to struggle with how to define itself in the Trump era, the 2025 races will be scrutinized to see what type of message and candidate profile connects with the party's base and the broader electorate. The Democratic soul-searching will continue in the midterm primaries for House and Senate seats, and into the 2028 presidential primary, as the party looks for new leaders who can win.\n\nWhat other races could be consequential?\n\nWhile a handful of races will get the most attention, there are other contests around the country that could have national implications.\n\nDetroit, Minneapolis, Seattle, Pittsburgh, Atlanta and other big, heavily Democratic cities are also voting for mayor at a time when Trump is battling with municipal leaders over deploying the National Guard for crime prevention. The winners could find themselves navigating the explosive issue of federal troops on their streets.\n\nPennsylvania voters will be asked whether they want to keep three state Supreme Court justices, all Democrats. Pennsylvania is a key swing state, and the makeup of its highest court could be critical in cases with national impact, such as election-related lawsuits. Gov. Josh Shapiro, a Democrat who is up for reelection in 2026 and is viewed as a potential 2028 presidential candidate, is urging voters to retain the justices in a new ad.\n\nVirginia and New Jersey also have legislative contests this year, and the Virginia attorney general's race is attracting attention after the Democrat became embroiled in a texting scandal. Democrats control every lever of state government in New Jersey and are seeking the same in Virginia, which impacts everything from redistricting to potential pushback against the Trump administration.",

        "title": "Why Gavin Newsom is gambling on new rules for Trump 2.0",
        "description": "Newsom has discarded Democrats' \"when they go low, we go high\" mantra.\n\nAt the beginning of the year, California Gov. Gavin Newsom's tenure was marked by devastating wildfires in Los Angeles, a steady stream of ridicule from the White House, and backlash from within the Democratic Party for siding with conservatives on transgender athletes in women's sports.\n\nNot to mention, in the summer of 2021, Newsom weathered a blistering attempt to recall him from office -- his starpower at risk.\n\nYet the twice-elected governor has pulled off a reputational heel turn, marked by viral Trump-mocking social media posts and parody MAGA merch coupled with a statewide redistricting measure that would level Republican's attempt to get an edge ahead of next year's midterms.\n\nNow, Newsom is a leader running miles ahead of others, experts explained to ABC News.\n\nOne of the most noticeable transformations was the rebrand of Newsom's official governor social media account. A senior Newsom official told ABC that the weekend of June 6, when the team learned the president was federalizing the National Guard into Los Angeles, was when the \"red line\" was crossed, and a more defiant version of the Democratic governor debuted.\n\n\"That is when everything changed, with the governor, with our social media,\" the official said.\n\nOn June 10, Newsom's @GovPressOffice account shared a TikTok video, where a voiceover, in the style of a Star Wars villain, mimicked Trump's TruthSocial post announcing the federalization of troops. That post generated over 800,000 views.\n\nThe salvo continued. The same day, Newsom, on Instagram, responded to Trump mocking him as \"Newscum\" on Truth Social with a diss-video set to the Taylor Swift (another common Trump target) song \"You Need To Calm Down,\" dismissing Trump as \"keyboard warrior.\" That short video has 11.3 million views.\n\nThe mocking never let up.\n\nA non-exhaustive list of the incoming includes: accusing Trump of having \"Newsom Derangement Syndrome,\" a play on Trump's oft-referred \"Trump Derangement Syndrome;\" likening Trump adviser Stephen Miller to Voldemort, the villain from the Harry Potter series, and calling him submissive; calling Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem \"Kosplay Kristi\" and urging followers to \"hide yo dogs,\" a reference to Noem's infamous tale of shooting and killing her own dog, Cricket; mocking Vice President JD Vance over a debunked rumor that he performed sex acts with a couch; and comparing White House border czar Tom Homan to an uncooked ham.\n\nSince then, Newsom's social media accounts have skyrocketed. Follower counts across multiple platforms for his non-government account, @GavinNewsom, ballooned -- growing to more than 11 million followers collectively. Nearly half of those followers were new this year.\n\nOne of the official accounts, @GovPressOffice, has seen nearly 1 billion impressions on X since those first provocative posts in June, per Newsom's campaign.\n\nNewsom even launched his own \"patriot\" merchandise shop, repurposing Trump's Make America Great Again slogan -- Make America Gavin Again -- and selling REAL PATRIOT hats NEWSOM WAS RIGHT ABOUT EVERYTHING! And REAL PATRIOT hats, and kneepads marked with Trump's signature.\n\nA key mark in Newsom's success is upending the \"when they go low, we go high\" mantra coined by Michelle Obama in 2016, suggested Parker Butler, the former director of Kamala Harris' presidential campaign's buzzy social media channel, @KamalaHQ. \"That is not where we are right now.\"\n\n\"When we see democracy hanging by a thread, we have to take risks. It feels very unrestrained, that's the kind of energy that I think Democrats need,\" said Butler, now a digital strategist and co-founder at Luminary Strategies.\n\n\"We need to throw the sort of old rulebook out the window,\" Butler added.\n\nWhen Newsom launched his new solo podcast \"This is Gavin Newsom\" in March, he said he wanted to \"debate without demeaning\" and engage with people most members his party wouldn't dare to speak to. He called the Democratic brand \"toxic.\" He's positioned himself as a lefty alternative in the GOP-de-jour manosphere space. His interview with Charlie Kirk, for instance, has 1.3 million YouTube views.\n\n\"When we go low, or when they go low, we go high, doesn't work when they're trying to pull the rug out completely from under us,\" said Olivia Julianna, a Gen-Z digital strategist and activist who spoke at the Democratic National Convention. Julianna was outraged with Newsom at the start of the year, in part due to his right-wing podcast guests, but she now considers herself a huge fan -- she's even bought his merch.\n\n\"I did not take Gavin Newsom seriously until he made it clear that he was ready to take action,\" Julianna added.\n\nNewsom's longtime speechwriter and former deputy chief of staff Jason Eliott described the online mockery as a strategy of \"holding up a mirror to the clown show that is the Trump administration. We're not doing anything differently than what they are doing.\"\n\nElliott said the buzz around Newsom's posts creates space for the \"actual substantive work,\" like Proposition 50, the ballot initiative that, if approved by voters on Tuesday, will temporarily adopt a new congressional map that redraws five districts to be more Democratic-leaning, potentially flipping five existing Republican seats in the midterms. Elliott said that since the office has sharpened its tone, donations have poured in from millions of supporters.\n\n\"How do you get 1.2 million people from all 50 states all across the country to buy into this defense of democracy? You do it by getting attention,\" Eliott said.\n\nNewsom, in a recent interview with ABC News' Jonathan Karl, concurred.\n\n\"We're trying to have a little humor in this process as well, and we're fighting fire with fire, not just rhetorically, in the context of that back and forth, but substantively, we can get into the 43 lawsuits, we can get in the work we're trying to do on Prop 50,\" Newsom explained.\n\n\"We're trying to have a little humor in this process as well, and we're fighting fire with fire, not just rhetorically, in the context of that back and forth, but substantively, we can get into the 43 lawsuits, we can get in the work we're trying to do on Prop 50,\" Newsom explained.\n\nJohn Dennis, former chair of the San Francisco Republican Party, said Newsom's tactic is the latest iteration of what he and other critics call a history of \"shapeshifting.\"\n\n\"He doesn't know who he is. So he's trying to be everybody else,\" Dennis said.\n\nBut he admits it appears to be working.\n\n\"This Prop 50 move is a very clever move for the Democrats. And he's got good people around him,\" Dennis said. \"They know that Trump is the center of the universe right now so he's just keeping his name alive and positioning himself as the Trump fighter -- and he's going to run that all the way into the Democrat primaries.\"\n\nDan Schnur, a longtime California political analyst and UC-Berkeley professor, called the Proposition 50 campaign \"a self-delivered political gift for Newsom.\"\n\nNewsom's successes put him in a solid position to launch a presidential bid, an ambition Californians are under no illusions about.\n\n\"Every governor looks in the mirror and sees a president looking back at them, and Newsom probably whistles \"Hail to the Chief\" when he's in the shower every morning,\" Schnur said. \"It's hard to predict exactly how the race plays out, but the governor of the largest state in the country, who is also the most visible and impactful Trump critic, and who has access to tremendous amounts of fundraising dollars could be a pretty formidable contender.\"",

        "title": "Democrats Running for Governor Stick to a Familiar Theme: Fight Trump",
        "description": "Lisa Lerer reported from Westville and Red Bank, N.J. and Reid J. Epstein reported from Alexandria, Va.\n\nRepresentative Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey stood in front of a train station in a downpour last week, lamenting the demise of a Hudson River rail tunnel after President Trump said he \"terminated\" federal funding for it.\n\nFour hours south, in a suburban Mexican restaurant, former Representative Abigail Spanberger of Virginia delivered a stump speech entirely devoted to her plans to fight the Trump administration.\n\nNeither woman is technically running against the president in their races for governor. But they might as well be.\n\n\"There's only one thing he seems to care about, and that is making sure he never gets crosswise with Donald Trump,\" Ms. Sherrill told the small crowd of supporters and commuters about her opponent, Jack Ciattarelli, a Republican whom she has labeled the \"Trump of Trenton.\"\n\n\"That's not who I am going to serve as your governor,\" she added.\n\nIn 2018, Ms. Spanberger and Ms. Sherrill rode a wave of anti-Trump energy to win Republican districts and political stardom. Both campaigned then as moderate moms with national security backgrounds.\n\nThat center-left strategy -- and the educated, suburban political coalition it activated -- became a model for Democrats in the elections that followed in 2020 and 2022.\n\nNow, with Mr. Trump back in the White House, the two women are positioning themselves as the second coming of Democratic opposition, hoping to once again ride a crest of liberal anger toward the president to power.\n\nLess than a year after a presidential election that sent Democrats into the political wilderness, Ms. Spanberger and Ms. Sherrill are testing whether that old strategy still works for a party scarred by its 2024 defeat.\n\nAmid months of tortured political soul searching, other Democrats have tried to address their party's failings with new strategies.\n\nIn New York City, Zohran Mamdani, the front-runner for mayor, powered a come-from-behind campaign with bold progressive promises, social media prowess and a fiercely liberal message that promises to upend the party establishment. In California, Gov. Gavin Newsom has abandoned the party's longstanding preference for abiding by political norms to champion an extraordinary effort to approve a new congressional map, pushing back on similar Republican moves and trying to maximize Democratic power.\n\nBut in New Jersey and Virginia, Ms. Spanberger and Ms Sherrill have decided to stick with reruns rather than pilot new programming.\n\n\"Amid all of the chaos coming out of Washington and all of this unsteadiness that is hurting so many of our communities, we are going to elect a governor who will stand up for Virginia,\" Ms. Spanberger told the crowd packed into the Mexican restaurant on an affluent stretch of suburban Alexandria's Del Ray neighborhood.\n\nLongtime roommates in Washington and close friends, Ms. Spanberger and Ms. Sherrill have taken similar approaches in their campaigns for governor.\n\nAs in 2018, both have structured their races as referendums on Washington, casting their opponents as lackeys to a powerful president and promising to fight Mr. Trump's agenda on issues from tariffs to abortion rights. National Democrats have positioned the races as the first opportunity for their powerless party to mount a comeback.\n\n\"You've got the DOGE cuts, federal contractors getting fired and layoffs and the government shutdown, plus all the other insanity of the Trump administration,\" said former Gov. Terry McAuliffe of Virginia. \"This is as good as it gets to be on the ballot as a Democrat.\"\n\nMs. Sherrill sees similarities between her race for governor and her initial run for Congress. Many of the issues that are a focus of her effort -- taxes, health care and the commuter rail tunnel -- are the same (though there also new topics, like rising costs from tariffs and high electricity prices.)\n\nBut Mr. Trump's total control over the Republican Party pushed Mr. Ciattarelli, who was endorsed by the president, to embrace elements of the president's agenda and shifted the tone of Ms. Sherrill's campaign away from talk of bipartisanship.\n\nDuring her first campaign, Ms. Sherrill said in an interview, \"there were still credible people in the Republican Party, and you were able to really make your argument and then bring a bipartisan coalition of people together around issues.\"\n\nThis time, she said: \"It's been more hard hitting.\"\n\nViews of her own party have changed, too. Just 30 percent voters said they had a favorable view of Democrats in a Quinnipiac University survey this fall, compared to nearly half who said the same in a poll conducted by CNN in October 2018.\n\n\"That experience in 2018 of flipping districts, like we all did, was really the formative experience,\" said Representative Jason Crow, a Colorado Democrat who also won his seat in 2018 and remains close with both Ms. Spanberger and Ms. Sherrill. Now, he says, \"There is discontent with the Democratic Party and there's discontent with some of the political leadership and people are wanting and demanding more.\"\n\nWhile both Ms. Spanberger and Ms. Sherrill have a record of bucking their own party leadership at times, neither woman is leading the conversation over the future of the Democratic Party.\n\nThat's a discussion better left to the many Democrats already eyeing what's widely expected to be a crowded presidential primary field in 2028, said Dan Sena, a Democratic strategist who oversaw the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee's strategy to win the House in 2018.\n\n\"For a governor, I'm not sure you want a firebrand in this day and age -- you want a steady hand to guide the values that matter most to your state,\" said Mr. Sena, who is working for a super PAC supporting Ms. Sherrill. \"There is still great power in candidates who have records of service and are independent minded.\"\n\nBut, some Democrats warn, the party's seven-year-old strategy of focusing on rejecting the president may eventually run its course.\n\n\"2028 could be a totally different animal,\" Senator Ruben Gallego of Arizona said after speaking at Ms. Spanberger's Virginia stop Thursday afternoon.\n\nNew Jersey and Virginia are the only states that elect governors in the year after a presidential race, a position that frequently transforms their contests into a quadrennial check on an administration's first year in office and has sometimes catapulted the victors into national figures.\n\nMr. Trump, who still motivates the Democratic base like no other political figure, is an irresistible target for Democrats. Polling shows that 56 percent of likely voters in New Jersey and 57 percent in Virginia disapprove of the way he is handling his job as president.\n\n\"The boogeyman is Trump,\" said Mo Butler, a Democratic political consultant and a former chief of staff to Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey. \"It's very difficult for a Democratic candidate -- especially statewide in this environment when Trump is president -- it's very difficult for them not to run that sort of campaign.\"\n\nMs. Spanberger's stump speech in the closing days of her campaign touched on the main points of Trump grievance for Democrats: the sprawling cuts to the federal work force -- an issue particularly acute in Virginia -- the president's erratic tariff and trade policy, cuts to health care spending and aggressive immigration enforcement and deportations.\n\nThose campaigning for her were more direct.\n\n\"What is happening is not OK,\" Alfonso Lopez, a member of the Virginia House of Delegates, told the crowd in Alexandria.\n\nIt is helpful for Ms. Spanberger to have drawn one of the weakest Republican opponents in recent memory. Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears has raised about half as much money as Ms. Spanberger and won only a tepid endorsement from Mr. Trump, late in the campaign.\n\n.\n\nMs. Sherrill has faced a tougher opponent in Mr. Ciattarelli, who has tried to combine some of the president's signature issues, like cracking down on immigration and transgender rights, with his focus on lowering taxes, public safety and improving schools.\n\nShe is attempting to replace Gov. Philip D. Murphy, a Democratic who is finishing his second term. Democrats have not won three consecutive governor's elections in the state since 1961.\n\nWith 860,000 more registered Democrats in the state than Republicans, the question for Ms. Sherrill is whether her anti-Trump message will be enough to mobilize Democrats, particularly Black and Latino voters who shifted right during the 2024 election.\n\nAs she crisscrossed the state on Thursday, Ms. Sherrill assailed both her opponent and Mr. Trump, linking the agendas of the two men over and over again.\n\nAllies made the stakes even more explicit to the crowd.\n\n\"You get to send a message right here in New Jersey that a free people bows to no king,\" Pete Buttigieg, the former secretary of transportation, told a cheering crowd at a campaign rally on Thursday. \"Not three years from now, but this coming Tuesday.\"\n\nRepresentative Frank Pallone, Democrat of New Jersey, made the stakes even more explicit to the crowd: \"Don't bring MAGA into New Jersey,\" he pleaded.",

        "title": "Federal agents allegedly wear Halloween masks during Los Angeles patrol",
        "description": "Austin Turner is a web producer at CBS News Los Angeles. An Inland Empire native, Austin earned a degree in journalism from San Jose State University in 2020. Before joining CBS News in 2025, he worked at KTLA, the San Jose Mercury News, the Sedona Red Rock News and various other outlets as a freelance sports reporter.\n\nFederal agents were spotted this week wearing what appeared to be Halloween masks while on patrol in Los Angeles, according to a community patrol group.\n\nThe Harbor Area Peace Patrols says it observes federal agents with the Department of Homeland Security, including Immigration and Customs Enforcement, daily as they leave U.S. Coast Guard Base Los Angeles/Long Beach, which is located on Terminal Island.\n\nOn the morning of Oct. 28, the group says, at least two agents were seen wearing Halloween masks. An agent driving a vehicle wore what appeared to be a clown mask, while another wore a \"Chucky\" mask from the \"Child's Play\" horror movie franchise.\n\nWhen asked by CBS LA for comment, DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin responded, \"Happy Halloween!\"\n\nThe right for law enforcement officers to wear masks has been subject to scrutiny in California since immigration enforcement operations ramped up in June. In September, Gov. Gavin Newsom signed legislation banning most officers, including those from ICE and the DHS, from wearing face coverings on duty.\n\n\"To ICE, [which is] unmasked. What are you afraid of,\" Newsom said after signing the bill. \"You're gonna do enforcement? Provide an ID.\"\n\nActing U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli later told CBS LA that Newsom has \"no jurisdiction\" on how federal law enforcement operates.\n\n\"We're not going to follow it,\" Essayli said. \"The law has no force or effect on federal agencies. The State of California has no jurisdiction to regulate anything that we do in the federal government and I've instructed our agents to disregard it.\"\n\nCBS LA reached out to LA City Councilmember Tim Mcosker, who represents the area where the agents were allegedly spotted, but did not immediately hear back.",

        "title": "Obama rallies Virginia and New Jersey in weekend campaign push before Election Day",
        "description": "Virginia Democratic gubernatorial candidate Abigail Spanberger joins former President Barack Obama, during a campaign event on Nov. 1, 2025, in Norfolk, Virginia.\n\nFormer President Barack Obama is encouraging voters to elect Democrats as governor in Virginia and New Jersey in elections this Tuesday that could signal the national mood 10 months into Donald Trump's second presidency and a year ahead of midterm elections that could reshape it.\n\nObama's Saturday appearances for Abigail Spanberger and Mikie Sherrill contrast with Trump spending the weekend at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, leaving Republicans Winsome Earle-Sears in Virginia and Jack Ciattarelli in New Jersey to campaign for themselves.\n\nAt the same time, California advocates were making a final push ahead of a statewide referendum over whether to redraw the state's congressional map in Democrats' favor. The effort backed by Gov. Gavin Newsom is part of a national redistricting battle that began when Trump urged GOP-run states to help him keep a friendly House majority in 2026.\n\nAt an afternoon rally in Norfolk, Obama praised Spanberger, a former congresswoman and CIA case officer, as a hard worker who would improve Virginians' financial circumstances and quality of life. Yet he focused much of his half-hour-plus on stage lambasting Trump for \"lawlessness and recklessness\" and \"shambolic\" economic policy, while urging voters to \"set a glorious example for the nation\" by rebuking Trump and nominees loyal to him.\n\n\"The stakes are now clear,\" Obama said. \"We don't need to speculate about the dangers to our democracy. We don't need to ask ourselves how much more coarse and mean our culture can become. Elections matter, and they matter to you.\"\n\nObama was scheduled to appear Saturday evening in Newark with Sherrill.\n\nEarle-Sears, currently Virginia's lieutenant governor, and Ciattarelli, a former state lawmaker, had busy schedules of their own to counter Democrats' large rallies. Ciattarelli's sharpest closing arguments nodded to Sherrill's ubiquitous inclusion of her experience as a Navy helicopter pilot and her frequent attacks on Trump.\n\n\"Her disdain for the president. And she can fly a helicopter. Is any of that going to fix New Jersey?\" Ciattarelli said Saturday in suburban Westfield.",

        "title": "Top Democrats' hateful rhetoric keeps stoking anti-ICE violence",
        "description": "If Democratic leaders are trying to promote political violence in America, they're succeeding brilliantly.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security reported Wednesday that death threats against ICE officers have soared 8,000% in fiscal year 2025, with wackos even placing bounties on agents' heads.\n\n\"Our officers are experiencing an unprecedented level of violence,\" fumed DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin, citing a shocking rash of threats to murder agents and attack their families, plus stalking and doxxing online.\n\nOne anonymous goon threatened a Texas ICE agent's spouse over the phone: \"Did you hear what happened to the Nazis after World War II? It's what's going to happen to your family.\"\n\nIt's not just lowlife nobodies: Prominent Democrats such as Govs. JB Pritzker (Ill.), Gavin Newsom (Calif.) and Tim Walz (Minn.), and Mayors Michelle Wu (Boston) and Brandon Johnson (Chicago) plus many other electeds slur these federal workers every day -- \"fascists,\" \"secret police,\" \"Nazis,\" \"thugs,\" \"vigilantes,\" \"authoritarians,\" \"Gestapo\" members, \"slave patrols,\" \"kidnappers.\"\n\nDemocrats may offer the hate speech scores just to score points with their base, but it also inspires sickos to violence -- to \"save\" America, don't you know?\n\nIn just the last month or two, a sniper opened fire on an ICE facility in Texas, killing two people; 10 goons were nabbed for physically attacking law-enforcement officers at Los Angeles anti-ICE \"protests\"; shooters injured two cops and a Border Patrol agent in another Texas attack.\n\nNor is it confined to immigration agents: Tyler Robinson, 22, is accused of slaying Turning Point founder Charlie Kirk for publicly expressing conservative views.\n\nHow many more will be hurt or killed before the ugly rhetoric ends?\n\nResponsible officials would speak out against such behavior, not fuel it.\n\nIf Democrats don't want illegal-immigrant criminals arrested, they need to win elections and change laws, not foment violence.\n\nThey were right all along in warning democracy is at risk; they just got it wrong about who's actually threatening it.",

        "title": "Newsom vs. Trump: What to know as California voters pick sides in a big political battle",
        "description": "Proposition 50 sparks debate over redistricting in California. It will play a substantial role in deciding which party controls the U.S. House.\n\nCalifornia voters on Nov. 4 will play a big role in deciding which party controls the U.S. House of Representatives for the final two years of President Donald Trump's time in office.\n\nCitizens of the nation's most populous state are weighing in on Proposition 50, a constitutional amendment pushed by Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom that would allow the state the chance to temporarily stop using a nonpartisan commission that draws their U.S. congressional district boundaries. Instead, California could use lines drawn by its Democratic state lawmakers in Sacramento that would increase their party's chances of winning more seats in Congress.\n\nBoth major political parties are rushing to redraw their congressional boundaries in at least a dozen states in an unprecedented push to determine which party will control the U.S. House after the 2026 midterm elections. Trump has pushed state lawmakers from Texas to Indiana to Missouri to redraw their maps to make them more favorable to the GOP in anticipation of historic trends in midterm elections that favor the opposition party that doesn't control the White House.\n\n\"What we have here - a redistricting to find additional seats for one party at the behest of the president - is really something quite novel,\" said Matthew Levendusky, a political science professor at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nSo how did we get here?\n\nRepublicans hold a razor-thin majority in the U.S. House and historically, the party that controls the White House fares poorly in midterm elections.\n\nDuring the 23 midterm elections since 1934, the president's party gained seats just three times, according to the American Presidency Project.\n\nIf Democrats take control of the House in the mid-terms, like when they won 40 new seats in the 2018 election during Trump's first term, it would likely mean congressional investigations, legislative paralysis - even possibly a third Trump impeachment.\n\nRepublicans keeping control of the House would allow the president to continue one of the most aggressive and disruptive agendas in modern presidential history.\n\nOver the summer, Trump began pushing state lawmakers in Texas, which has the largest Republican controlled delegation in the country, to redraw district lines to edge out some of the 12 Democrats who represent the state.\n\nAfter some drama - Democratic lawmakers fled the state - the Texas legislature approved new maps which created five new Republican-leaning congressional districts. The new lines face several federal lawsuits.\n\nCalifornia, which has the largest Democratic delegation in the country, responded by moving to redraw it's own districts, essentially cancelling out Texas' efforts.\n\nUnder Texas law, the state Legislature draws the Congressional district boundaries. But, under California's current Constitution, a nonpartisan commission draws the lines, so lawmakers have to get voter approval to change the constitution.\n\nCalifornia's Proposition 50 seeks to let the legislature redraw the state's congressional districts through 2030 to create five more seats favorable to Democrats. The map is already complete and public.\n\nAren't other states doing this?\n\nNormally, states redraw district boundaries after the U.S. Census occurs every ten years. Changes are generally only made between each census if someone challenges the boundaries in court and wins.\n\nAlong with Texas, Republicans have turned their new map into law in Missouri -- though voters may have the opportunity to reject the Show-Me State's changes in a special election. Ohio is also in the process of redistricting, and Republicans in North Carolina, Kansas, and Indiana are moving toward redrawing their maps.\n\nDemocratic leaders have joined the effort, pushing blue states to draw new lines to help their party too. Democratic-controlled legislatures in Illinois, New York, and Maryland have been considering moves, too, with varying degrees of interest among party leaders.\n\nIt's still too soon to know if more states will follow suit, but federal level officials in both parties continue to push their state level counterparts to act.\n\nAccording to the National Conference of State Legislatures, at least 11 states explicitly prohibit mid-decade redistricting, while other states explicitly allow it.\n\nWill the results be known election night?\n\nIf the margins are wide, Americans could know if Proposition 50 passed on election night.\n\nBut California has a history of taking a long time to count ballots, and voters tend to turn out in large numbers even for special elections (To be fair, there are 23 million registered voters there.)\n\nSo, if the margins are close, a final result could take weeks.\n\nProposition 50 seems poised to pass, favored by 20 points in an Emerson College poll taken Oct. 20-21.\n\nA statewide survey released Oct. 28 by the Public Policy Institute of California found that 56% of California likely voters said they would vote yes on the proposition. The survey also found that regardless of their position on the proposition, most voters said they believe the outcome is very important.\n\nThe survey also found that approval ratings for Trump in California remain low and that Californians identify political extremism or threats to democracy as the most important problem facing the nation.\n\n\"About nine in 10 likely voters say the outcome on the vote of Prop. 50 is at least somewhat important, including two in three who say it is very important,\" PPIC researcher Deja Thomas, said. \"Notably, we've not seen such a high level of importance placed on a ballot proposition since the survey began measuring this over 20 years ago.\"\n\nWhat does this mean politically?\n\nEvery seat counts in the 2026 midterms. Democrats currently need to gain just three seats to win control of the House.\n\nCalifornia's new boundaries could negate the new seats Republicans expects to win under Texas' new map. If Proposition 50 passes, there will likely be more pressure on other states to redraw their districts.\n\nBeyond 2026, Newsom has a lot riding politically on his bid to get the state's voters to agree to redraw its political maps as a way to push back on Trump, namely his potential 2028 presidential campaign.\n\nHe made his clearest comment yet about his future plans \"CBS News Sunday Morning\" Oct. 26, when he was asked whether he would give a presidential run serious thought after the midterms.\n\n\"Yeah,\" he said, adding that saying otherwise, \"I'd just be lying, and I can't do that.\"\n\nHow does the Supreme Court factor in?\n\nThe Supreme Court is currently weighing whether electoral districts can be created to protect the voting rights of minorities without discriminating against voters of other races.\n\nTheir decision could restrict a key provision of the landmark Voting Rights Act enacted 60 years ago that tries to keep legislative map drawers from diluting the votes of racial minorities by either packing them into one district or spreading them out among too many districts to have an impact.\n\nRepublican lawmakers in Louisiana, which the case is focused on, are considering legislation to push back the state's 2026 primary elections by a month. That could give lawmakers extra time to redraw the state's House district lines if the Supreme Court strikes down the current boundaries.\n\nOther states, particularly those with high Black populations, could join the redistricting fight depending on the Court's decision.\n\nIsn't redistricting normally about changes to a state's population?\n\nYes, redistricting is usually tied to the state's population.\n\nEvery 10 years a census of the nation's population is taken and the number of representatives each state has is rebalanced. Then, each state redraws the congressional and legislative boundaries to account for how their population has changed. For example, the 2020 census showed California's population had dropped and Texas' population Texas increased. That meant California got fewer members of Congress and Texas got more.\n\nBut, what is happening right now has nothing to do with population changes. There are still going to be the same number of congressional seats in each state.\n\nTexas, California and other states redrawing their boundaries right now are intentionally, and vocally, changing which citizens are in which districts so there is a greater chance of the state's majority party winning more seats in the U.S. Congress - and therefore whether Democrats or Republicans are in power for Trump's final two years as president.\n\nWhat does it mean for the future?\n\nPolitical experts like Levendusky are concerned that once the norm is broken for redrawing districts in the middle of a decade it could become a routinely-used political tool.\n\n\"Especially in a closely-divided House, this will up the pressure to continue to do this in the future, where both parties look to eke out the maximum gain from every state,\" he said. \"The losers are the voters in the political minority in a state who no longer get their voices heard by their elected officials.\"\n\nWhat do Californians think?\n\nUSA TODAY Network reporters spoke to Californians about a month before Election Day and found that many were frustrated, angry and wanting to push back against Trump or Newsom - from the rural, Republican North State to liberal enclaves along California's coast.\n\nWhat is this special election costing?\n\nProposition 50 is the only item on the ballot for this special election, which is expected to cost $282.6 million in taxpayer funds, according to the California Department of Finance.\n\nDemocrats have poured money into convincing voters to approve the initiative. It is already one of the most expensive ballot fights in state history.",

        "title": "White House hopefuls hit the 2025 campaign trail as Democrats try to turn the page",
        "description": "Former Vice President Kamala Harris and California Governor Gavin Newsom said they are considering 2028 presidential runs.\n\nWASHINGTON -- The Democrats' most recent presidential nominee is largely missing from the campaign trail one year after President Donald Trump delivered her party a thorough drubbing, opening the door for many others who are flirting with plans to compete against Kamala Harris in 2028 for the White House.\n\nHarris is currently on a book tour but does have her sights set on California, where on Saturday she'll be making her first in-person appearance in a 2025 race as voters in her home state decide whose side to take in a battle with Trump over redrawing congressional boundaries before the all-important 2026 midterms.\n\nBut neither Harris nor former President Joe Biden, who quit the Democratic ticket last year under political pressure, have campaigned in person for their party's nominees in the only gubernatorial races this year in Virginia and New Jersey.\n\nInstead, the Democratic Party is turning to a familiar force in those races during times of political crisis: former President Barack Obama, who has been featured in campaign ads in California and will headline rallies this weekend for Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey and Abigail Spanberger in Virginia.\n\nA number of politicians who've been tossed around as possible 2028 contenders have also dropped in on either or both states with governor races, often showcasing their resumes to distinguish themselves from a deep bench that wants to be part of the Democrats' rebuilding narrative.\n\n\"For many Democrats, they've turned the page,\" veteran Democratic strategist Jim Manley said. \"We as a party are desperate to try and look for leaders for the future. Unfortunately, we haven't found them yet.\"\n\nOn a Oct. 29 livestream for both of his party's candidates, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, who will lead the Democratic Governor's Association next year, immediately touted his electoral success as a two-term Democrat in a red state that Trump won decisively.\n\n\"I'm living, breathing proof that Democrats can and should win everywhere,\" Beshear said.\n\nOther top names were on the call, too, including Sens. Cory Booker, D-N.J., and Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., two former 2020 presidential contenders who touted the need for Democrats to score big victories and make this election an anti-Trump referendum.\n\n\"This is our chance to show that the MAGA world is not going to win when it comes to what the people want,\" Booker said during the Oct. 29 livestream.\n\nEven more have dropped by, such as Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, who stumped in Virginia, while former Biden Cabinet official Pete Buttigieg, Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., and former Japanese ambassador and Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel have done events in both states.\n\nKhanna and Emanuel have also campaigned in New York City, where 34-year-old Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani has excited progressives in his bid to be mayor of the nation's largest city. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., another possible 2028 contender, said Mamdani's candidacy represents a new hope for the city and nation.\n\nShe suggested voters are rallying behind the democratic socialist to take a stand against the Trump administration but also a \"bygone\" Democratic establishment embodied by former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, his opponent who is running for mayor as an independent.\n\n\"It is going to take all of us, but to be honest it always has,\" Ocasio-Cortez said. \"It is not a coincidence that the very forces that Zohran is up against in this race mirrors what we are up against nationally.\"\n\nTrump has referred to Mamdani as a \"communist\" and said it will be a \"fluke\" if the politician he's threatened with arrest is elected on Nov. 4. Still, Trump, a New York City native who has knocked the GOP candidate in the race, Curtis Sliwa, has not joined moderate Republicans in backing Cuomo.\n\nIn Virginia, Trump has kept Republican gubernatorial candidate Winsome Earle-Sears at arms length, even as he endorsed the state's attorney general, Jason Miyares, in his reelection bid. Miyares is facing off against Democrat Jay Jones. Trump and Vice President JD Vance have called on Jones to drop out of the race over violent text messages.\n\nTrump has lent Jack Ciatterelli his support in New Jersey, campaigning for the Republican virtually. But neither Trump nor Vance have made in-person campaign stops in the two states they lost handily to Democrats in 2024.\n\nBiden largely out of the 2025 picture\n\nBiden has been less active politically as the 82-year-old former president fights prostate cancer. He completed a course of radiation therapy in late October. But he has not been out of the public eye altogether.\n\nAs he accepted a life achievement award at the Edward M. Kennedy Institute in Boston on Oct. 27, Biden said the nation's \"democracy is at stake\" and declared \"it's no time to give up.\"\n\n\"These are dark days,\" Biden said. \"But we are one of the only countries in the world that has time and again has come out of every crisis we faced, stronger than we went into that crisis, every one.\"\n\nThe former president also plans to headline the Nebraska Democratic Party's annual gala on Nov. 7.\n\nA spokesperson for Biden had no comment.\n\nHarris is on a mostly-sold out book tour, promoting her campaign memoir, \"107 Days.\" But she has no tour dates on the calendar in the week leading up to Election Day. Her next stop is in Seattle on Nov. 4, which is the day of the election.\n\nIn her book, Harris took Biden's inner circle to task for refusing to tell the elderly president he should not seek reelection. She also revealed that former Obama White House staffer David Plouffe, a senior adviser on her 2024 campaign, pushed her to distance herself from Biden.\n\n\"People hate Joe Biden,\" she says Plouffe told her.\n\nOn the 2025 campaign trail, Harris' involvement has primarily been digital. She's sent fundraising emails for Spanberger and recorded robocalls for Sherrill.\n\nThe former Democratic 2024 presidential nominee endorsed the Proposition 50 campaign in California, where potential 2028 rival Gavin Newsom is spearheading the bid to combat Trump ahead of the 2026 midterm elections, in an Oct. 30 video, in which she accused Trump and the GOP of \"trying to rig the system around congressional maps.\" She's appearing on Saturday at a rally in California in support of the ballot initiative.\n\nHarris begrudgingly endorsed Mamdani in a television interview and made no appearances on the stump for any Democrat competing this fall. She recently held a closed-door fundraiser for former Democratic North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, who is competing in next year's election for the state's open Senate seat.\n\nA spokesperson for Spanberger's campaign did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nSherill did not directly answer a question from USA TODAY during an October editorial board meeting with the Bergen Record, a USA TODAY Network partner, when asked if she would welcome Harris on the trail. Sherill said her campaign makes invites based on who people ask to visit.\n\nThe four-term congresswoman, who is locked in a tight battle with Republican Jack Ciatterelli, said her constituents wanted to hear more about Maryland Gov. Wes Moore's anti-violence programs and Latino voters asked about Arizona Sen. Ruben Gallego.\n\n\"If people want to see (Harris) and ask for her at a certain rally, she is certainly someone that... a lot of people are invested in her book tour, and she still has that kind of draw,\" Sherill said.\n\n\"If that's the case, if people, you know, are requesting her, then we'll reach out.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Harris said that Spanberger and Sherill had invited her but it did not work with her schedule.\n\nHarris weighs her future\n\nHarris recently confirmed that she's considering another presidential bid.\n\n\"I am not done,\" she told the BBC in late October. \"I have lived my entire career as a life of service, and it's in my bones.\"\n\nBut early polling of the race suggests the party faithful are ready to move on. A University of New Hampshire survey of likely Democratic primary voters in October had Harris in fourth place in a prospective 2028 contest, behind Buttigieg, Newsom and Ocasio-Cortez, in that order.\n\nHarris had a 55% favorability rating in the poll, with 26% neutral, 17% unfavorable and almost no one undecided about their views on her.\n\nBy comparison, the most popular Democrat polled, Buttigieg, had an 81% approval rating, with 9% neutral, 6% negative and 4% still making up their minds. Newsom had a 58% approval rating, with 24% neutral, 10% opposed and 8% expressing uncertainty.\n\nMost primary voters in the early voting state were still forming their opinions about other potential candidates such as Beshear, Gallego, Khanna and Moore.\n\nOne prominent national Democrat, who asked to remain anonymous in order to speak candidly about the former president and vice president, pointed to the survey as evidence of the fading appeal of Harris. The party's most recent presidential nominee should not be trailing the pack a year after her history-making run, the person said.\n\nHarris can still help the party in targeted ways, the Democrat offered. But Biden is finished, the person said.\n\nThe Obama factor\n\nWith the party's most recent standard bearers largely out of the picture, Obama, the Democrats' most popular figure, has stepped in to fill the void.\n\nHe's cut ads for Sherill, Spanberger and Newsom's redistricting play in California. The ads in Virginia focus on the economy, voting rights and abortion access. The New Jersey spot hits on the economy and safety and reminds voters that Sherill is a former federal prosecutor, mother and Navy veteran.\n\nObama will campaign on Nov. 1 for Sherill in Newark and Spanberger in Norfolk on the final weekend of the campaign.\n\nIn announcing the appearance, Sherill said, \"President Obama reminds us what we can accomplish when we leaders are unafraid to take on big challenges to deliver.\"\n\nManley, the Democratic strategist and longtime Capitol Hill leadership aide, said it's \"about damn time\" Obama took on a more high-profile role in the current political debate.\n\nThe former president has been out of office for nearly nine years. Yet, he's still seen as Democrats' best hope for going toe-to-toe with Trump, who held a tele-rally for Ciattarelli to kick off early voting in New Jersey.\n\n\"He's still got his fastball,\" Manley said of Obama. \"And he's still wildly popular with the base, and no one gives a speech like him.\"\n\nVoters of Tomorrow executive director Santiago Mayer said Obama stirs up nostalgia for Gen Z on the campaign trail because he was the last person to serve as president before the hard-right shift in national politics.\n\n\"That will attract a lot of people who are excited to see that return to normalcy, see that excitement, see that energy, and really, the energy of change that Obama represented,\" Mayer said of his presence.\n\nThe 23-year-old liberal activist, whose group has been helping organize youth support for Spanberger and Sherill, said Gen Z voters still have a lot of affection for Harris. Her campaign was hampered by a double-digit swing in support from the demographic group to Trump, but Mayer said her backing from young people should not be underestimated.",

        "title": "SNAP benefits run dry as government shutdown continues, here's how states are stepping in",
        "description": "Many states have allocated millions of dollars to food banks.\n\nBeginning Saturday, some 42 million low-income Americans, including 16 million children, lost access to benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) as the government shutdown continues.\n\nThe Department of Agriculture has said that funding for this month's benefits, which it says comes to about $9.5 billion, has run dry.\n\nThe Trump administration has said that it will not provide a funding lifeline to SNAP, as it has to fund military and other government salaries and benefits affected by the shutdown, and has joined Republicans, who control both chambers in Congress, in blaming Democrats for the situation.\n\nSNAP has traditionally been entirely federally funded, but is administered by states. That means the shutdown's impact on SNAP and when benefits will start to become unavailable will vary by state.\n\nSome states have initiated their own contingency plans, using their own funding in most cases, to keep their SNAPs running.\n\nHere is a list of what states have announced so far\n\nOn Oct. 29, Arizona Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs announced the state would be deploying $1.8 million in funds to offset the loss of SNAP.\n\nOf that money, 1.5 million, she said, \"will be allocated to food banks across the state to fill gaps for SNAP households seeking food,\" while the remainder will be used by Food Bucks Now, an emergency fresh food program that provides vouchers for vegetables and produce.\n\nThe state allocated $80 million to food banks across the state, according to Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom.\n\nDemocratic Gov. Jared Polis sent a request last week to the state legislature to approve \"$10 million in General Fund revenue to support food banks and pantries, and another to extend previously approved funding for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) nutrition access through November.\"\n\nThree million dollars in emergency funding was given to Connecticut Foodshare, a non profit that helps food banks in the state, Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont said on Oct. 27.\n\nDemocratic Gov. Matt Meyer declared a state of emergency on Oct. 29 that \"ordered that funds be identified and transferred to the Department of Health and Social Services (DHSS) for the continuation of SNAP payments.\"\n\nPayments will be made weekly.\n\nOn Oct. 29, the state has launched the Hawai\u02bbi Relief Program which will provide \"up to four months of TANF support for housing and utility payments for eligible families who have at least one dependent child in their household and are in financial crisis or have an episode of need.\"\n\nResidents who are not SNAP beneficiaries can apply, according to Gov. Josh Green.\n\nThe state also donated $2 million to food banks.\n\nDemocratic Gov. JB Pritzker signed an executive order on Oct. 30 that allocated $25 million in state funding to food banks.\n\nThe state was ordered by Gov. Kim Reynolds to match up to $1 million in donations to the state's food banks.\n\nGov. Jeff Landry declared a state of emergency on Oct. 24 and ordered the state legislature to authorize stabilization funds to help residents in need.\n\nAs of Oct 31, the legislature has not given the authorization.\n\nOne million dollars from Democratic Gov. Janet Mills's office will be sent to food banks.\n\nGov. Wes Moore issued a state of emergency on Oct. 30 and allocated $10 million to food banks\n\nThe Massachusetts Emergency Food Assistance program, which provides food assistance, received an additional $4 million in state funding, Democratic Gov. Maura Healey announced Thursday.\n\nDemocratic Gov. Tim Walz announced on Oct. 27 that he had allocated $4 million to food banks.\n\nFive million dollars from the state has been delivered to food banks, Democratic Gov. Mike Kehoe said Oct. 29.\n\nAn additional $10.6 million fund transfer was sent to Missouri Area Agencies on Aging for programs to feed seniors.\n\nDemocratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham announced on Oct. 29 that the state would distribute $30 million in state-funded food benefits onto existing EBT cards for eligible New Mexicans.\n\nA state of emergency was declared on Oct. 30 by Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul.\n\nThe governor announced that the state would provide $40 million in new funding for the Hunger Prevention and Nutrition Assistance Program, which provides emergency food relief, and $25 million to Nourish N.Y., which supplies surplus agricultural products to food banks.\n\nThe state will offer $10 million to state food banks, Democratic Gov. Josh Stein said on Oct. 30. An additional $8 million will be funded by private organizations and charities in partnership with the state, the governor said.\n\nRepublican Gov. Kelly Armstrong announced on Oct. 30 that he allocated $915,000 of state funds to food banks and $600,000 for the state's (WIC) program.\n\nTwenty-five million in state funding will be used to offset SNAP losses, GOP Gov. Mike DeWine said after he signed an executive order on Oct. 30.\n\nAs part of the order, as much as $18 million in emergency relief benefits will be given to Ohio residents who are at or below 50% of the federal poverty level. Seven million dollars will also be donated to food banks.\n\nDemocratic Gov. Tina Kotek declared a food emergency on Oct. 29 that will be in effect in November and December.\n\nKotek ordered that \"$5 million from the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) carryover funds,\" be sent to food banks.\n\n\"TANF carryover is unspent federal TANF funding from prior years that remains available until used,\" the governor's office said in a news release.\n\nA state of emergency was issued by Democratic Gov. Dan McGee on Oct. 28 and he allocated $6 million in Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) to 20,000 eligible families.\n\nHe also allocated \"$200,000 of Social Services Block Grant funding to enhance capacity at the RI Community Food Bank,\" according to the governor's office.\n\nGOP Gov. Glen Youngkin issued a state of emergency and launched the Virginia Emergency Nutrition Assistance (VENA) initiative.\n\nThe program will provide residents with state funds weekly to be used in lieu of SNAP through November. A million dollars will also be allocated to food banks.\n\nThe state will provide $2.2 million per week to food banks across Washington until SNAP funding is restored, according to Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson.\n\nRepublican Gov. Patrick Morrisey announced on Oct. 28 that the state would be supporting a food drive and match up to $13 million in donations to food banks.",

        "title": "California Promised Insurance Relief, But Delivered Loopholes",
        "description": "Even before the devastating wildfires that ravaged Los Angeles this year, companies that insure the ever-growing number of homes perched in California's fire-prone foothills were threatening to abandon the state, declaring that the risks were becoming unsupportable.\n\nThe prospect of uninsurable homes was an existential threat for the state. A collapse in its $446 billion real estate economy would bring California to its knees. Gov. Gavin Newsom's administration went into crisis negotiations with the insurance industry, and emerged in September 2023, with what was billed as an \"historic\" compromise, one that would reward insurers with higher rates in exchange for protecting homeowners in neighborhoods that climate change was turning into tinder boxes.\n\nThe central promise was that insurers would have to write policies in fire-prone areas at a rate equal to at least 85 percent of their market share across the state. But a New York Times investigation has found that a series of loopholes quietly negotiated by the insurance industry all but eliminated that guarantee.\n\nVast swaths of the designated areas where insurers must write new policies do not in fact overlap with areas that California's state fire marshal deems to be the most fire-prone, the investigation found, meaning that insurers can load up on coverage in areas the state considers to be safer and still qualify to charge higher rates.\n\nAs a result, insurance companies will be able to raise rates and offload billions of dollars in costs and liabilities to ratepayers while taking on few, if any, new customers in high fire-risk areas.\n\nAnd while the regulations were billed as an attempt to get homeowners off the state's toverburdened last-resort insurance program, FAIR, the number of residential FAIR policies has nearly doubled since the new insurance deal was announced, rising to 625,033 from 320,581, the Times review found.\n\nSome insurers began minimizing their potential losses even before the new regulations were finalized. In the six months after the deal was announced, California's three largest insurance groups informed the state of their plans to dump nearly 50,000 existing policies, five times the number filed by those companies in the 20 months preceding the deal. And the new regulations will effectively reward them for doing it.\n\nMore than a fifth of the nonrenewals -- about 11,000 policies in total -- were in ZIP codes within or adjacent to areas that would burn in the January fires, the Times analysis found. The vast majority of those were in and around Pacific Palisades, where fire later destroyed more than 6,800 structures.\n\nMaggie Neilson, a 53-year-old philanthropy consultant, had a policy from Foremost on her 2,500-square-foot house in Pacific Palisades until the company elected not to renew it in March 2024.\n\nThe only insurer Ms. Neilson could find to replace the policy was the FAIR plan, which charged her about 40 percent more than Foremost had for about 40 percent less coverage. \"At the time, the media was saying everyone knows this is a problem and the governor and others are working on it, so I didn't think too much about it,\" she said.\n\nThen in January, her home and all of its contents were destroyed by the Palisades fire. She said her FAIR policy will pay her $1.5 million for a rebuild that she has been told will cost around $3 million.\n\nProponents of the new rules said they would allow rates to reflect the risks of hotter, drier weather and provide a business case for insurers to offer policies in high-risk areas. Representatives for Farmers Insurance, one of the few companies that agreed to discuss the regulations, praised them as a \"return to a more effective rating regime\" that \"will bring positive change to the California insurance marketplace.\"\n\nRicardo Lara, California's elected state insurance commissioner who led the drafting of the new rules, said the state was \"in crisis mode\" when it negotiated the new regulations, with seven of the 12 top insurers in the state halting or restricting the writing of new policies in California.\n\n\"You constantly have to strike the balance between, you know, the consumer protections, giving consumers options, and having a robust and thriving insurance market,\" Mr. Lara said.\n\nHe said the new rules would offer tens of thousands of Californians the chance to purchase protection for their homes that might otherwise have been unavailable at any price.\n\nConfronted with The Times' findings about ways insurers could shortchange their promises to insure in high-risk areas, Mr. Lara conceded that the rules might not deliver the hoped-for outcomes immediately. Insurers, he said, had \"bullied\" the state as it drafted the new rules. But he predicted that, as rates rose, competition would eventually push insurers back into writing policies in high-risk zones.\n\n\"This is uncharted territory,\" he said. \"Will this be perfect? Absolutely not.\"\n\nNo Insurance, No Housing\n\nFrom the insurance industry's perspective, the roots of the current crisis can be traced back to 1988. Voters passed an initiative that year that made California one of about a dozen states where homeowners' insurance rate increases must be preapproved by an elected insurance commissioner. The industry has long complained that the system keeps rates in California artificially low.\n\nBy the early spring of 2023, when Governor Newsom began meeting with industry lobbyists, some of California's largest property insurers had already stopped or curtailed writing new business in the state. State Farm and Farmers, which together comprise one third of the market, started pulling back in May and July of that year.\n\nExisting policies were not affected, but the changes meant that home buyers were left with few options for insuring their new properties other than the FAIR plan, a consortium of all the companies licensed to offer property insurance in the state. FAIR is required by law to sell bare-bones fire policies to people who can't find coverage in the regular market.Insurers share any profits from FAIR in good times, but must cover all of its losses.\n\n\"I think that was the moment when we really started to get nervous,\" recalled Ann Patterson, a senior counselor to the governor who was involved in the discussions. \"We only have so many more big carriers that can pick up that demand, and if they can't pick it up, then everybody's going to end up on the FAIR plan.\"\n\nIt was generally agreed that FAIR was not a solution. Its lean policies rarely covered the actual cost to rebuild a home, even though they generally cost more than regular policies. Nearly 7 percent of realtors surveyed in 2023 by the California Association of Realtors said that they had deals fall out of escrow that year because buyers couldn't find adequate, affordable coverage.\n\nIt was not a problem just for wealthy homeowners in Brentwood and Malibu. Nearly a third of California's 40 million residents live in or near highly flammable, brushy or densely forested wildlands.\n\nInsurers made it clear that big, regulatory changes were needed to keep them in the market, addressing rising construction costs as well as climate change.\n\nCalifornia requires companies to provide detailed financial information justifying rate-increase requests; if they seek 7 percent or more, the requests can be challenged in public hearings and take up to a year to resolve.\n\nHistorically, wildfire losses figured in those calculations, but insurers had to show data on their actual payouts. They wanted California regulators to instead join other states in allowing rates based on climate-change models that estimate future losses.\n\nSeren Taylor, vice president of the Personal Insurance Federation of California, the lead lobbying group for insurers in California, said rate increases will help avert a serious threat to the state's economy. \"You don't have to care about insurers per se, but you have to care about having a healthy insurance market,\" he said. \"We had to give insurers the tools they need to have a functional market.\"\n\nThe 85 Percent Promise\n\nThe deal with insurers, as described by Mr. Lara when he announced it, contained an unambiguous promise: If carriers wanted to charge higher rates, they would have to write policies in \"fire zones\" at a rate \"no less\" than 85 percent of their statewide market share.\n\nIf a carrier's statewide market share is 20 percent, for example, its share in designated distressed areas would have to be at least 17 percent.\n\nTo reach the 85 percent standard, insurers can offer policies to homeowners currently on the FAIR plan, though nothing requires them to do that. Or they can write policies anywhere in a list of 662 distressed ZIP codes.\n\nSome of those ZIP codes neatly overlap the state's high-fire-risk zone maps, like the one covering Topanga, a town known for its hippie scene. Topanga sits in a steep, rugged canyon in the Santa Monica Mountains that can become a wind tunnel, where embers can be blown for miles.\n\nBut the Times analysis found that many \"distressed\" ZIP codes extend well beyond the riskiest fire zones. The 90063 area, for instance, is in the dense heart of urban East Los Angeles, with only a small sliver overlapping areas deemed at high risk of a blaze -- and that sliver has no homes in it at all.\n\nAnd half of California's 58 counties qualify under the regulations as \"distressed\" in their entirety, even though only a minority of the single-family homes located within them are in high or very high fire risk zones. In Ventura County, which sprawls from urban strip malls and moist strawberry fields to forested peaks, more than 100,000 homes, or roughly 60 percent of the county's single-family structures, are clustered in areas with lower wildfire risk. Yet insuring any of them would help a company meet the 85 percent target.\n\nPlacer County, just north of Sacramento, stretches east from suburbs dominated by new subdivisions with few mature trees into the pine-covered slopes of the Sierra Nevada mountains, where rugged terrain and dense vegetation create a higher fire danger.\n\nPolicies written anywhere in the county count toward the requirement.\n\nBut a savvy insurer could meet it by zeroing in on Roseville, a city of about 160,000 residents whose boundaries barely graze the high-risk zones -- in fact, one of its three main ZIP codes falls entirely outside the zones.\n\nIn more than 100 of the state's distressed ZIP codes, fewer than a third of single-family homes are in high-fire-risk zones, the Times analysis found. In more than 70 of the ZIP codes, less than 10 percent of homes are in those zones.\n\nMr. Lara's deputy commissioner, Mike Peterson, acknowledged in an interview that insurers will probably gravitate toward those lower-risk homes. But he predicted that those opportunities \"will be sucked up very quickly, which will force everybody into the more-fire-risk areas.\"\n\nInsurers who cannot or choose not to meet the 85-percent requirement can still qualify for the new rate increases. A pair of what industry lobbyists called \"offramps\" were negotiated as alternatives to the 85 percent rule. Insurers can claim hardship and petition the commissioner for a waiver; or they can take advantage of an option, originally intended just for small companies, that requires only that they increase the number of policies they have in the designated distressed zones by 5 percent over the previous year.\n\n\"We decided to include the 5 percent option in order to give all companies a way to incrementally get to the 85 percent target in a way that is sustainable and doesn't put their solvency at risk,\" said Michael Soller, Mr. Lara's spokesman.\n\nBut the way the provision was written meant that insurers that had spent much of 2024 dumping customers by the tens of thousands would, at least initially, be able to meet an even lower bar.\n\n'We Were Being Bullied'\n\nEight days after the deal was announced in September 2023, Foremost Insurance reported that it had already begun to drop policies in fire-prone areas across the state.\n\nOver the following five months, as Mr. Lara's office was writing the regulations, three insurers followed suit: Farmers Insurance, CSAA and State Farm.\n\nThese companies told Mr. Lara that they would be dropping more than 50,000 policies in more than 800 ZIP codes, heavily concentrated in the most fire-prone areas of the state.\n\nThis was a different thing entirely than declining to write policies for new customers. It meant that even people whose homes met underwriting standards and who had paid their premiums on time weren't safe.\n\nBesides Pacific Palisades and other Los Angeles County communities like Calabasas and Brentwood, some of the hardest-hit neighborhoods were in Contra Costa, Santa Cruz and Santa Clara counties, the Times review found. In one ZIP code in Los Gatos, a forested town pressed up against the foothills of the Santa Cruz mountains, State Farm indicated that it would dump two out of three of its customers, and Farmers said it would dump half.\n\nYvette Curran got her nonrenewal notice from Farmers n January 2024. Effective in April, the company would no longer insure her home in the hills north of Santa Cruz. She had been a loyal customer for 12 years.\n\n\"What do you do?\" she said. \"There's no nobody else to insure you.\"\n\nSimilar stories were unfolding across the state. In Lake County in Northern California, where more than 2,000 homes and 65 percent of the land area has burned in a series of devastating fires over the last decade, Foremost dropped the vast majority of its customers; Farmers also issued nonrenewal notices there, but was more selective.\n\n\"I can't go to the grocery store or walk into a coffee shop or go to a Rotary meeting where there isn't a couple or three folks who have a horrific story about being nonrenewed,\" said Mike McGuire, the California State Senate leader, who represents Lake County.\n\nRex Frazier, president of the Personal Insurance Federation of California, said the nonrenewals occurred at a time when insurers were not yet certain of what the final rules would be, and \"needed to respond to their mounting financial problems.\"\n\nBut Governor Newsom was frustrated, aides said. Insurers had issued nonrenewals in large numbers before, but this wave came after the industry and the state had struck their deal.\n\nMr. Lara said in an interview that he was angry, too. \"I was livid, and yes, I did feel like we were being bullied,\" he said. But whatever he felt privately, he said little in public, telling The Times that he felt it would be counterproductive to berate the very companies he was trying to woo back.\n\nYet the state effectively rewarded their behavior by grandfathering in the nonrenewals when it finalized the regulations. Companies like State Farm and Foremost that had dumped more than 5 percent of their customers in fire zones could now add back that 5 percent -- perhaps in a lower-risk part of a ZIP code -- and still qualify to charge the new higher rates.\n\nBy the time the department put the finishing touches on the regulatory package in December 2024, the state had offered two additional carrots to the industry. One was a cap on the amount of wildfire-related losses that insurance companies comprising the FAIR plan previously had to shoulder. Now, anything above $500 million would have to be borne by residential policyholders across the state. The other was to let insurers factor into their rate calculations the cost of reinsurance, which they buy to hedge the risk of an expensive catastrophe.\n\nConsumer Watchdog, an advocacy group that by law represents California policy holders in rate hearings, estimated that the reinsurance provision alone could raise premiums by an additional 40 percent.\n\nFallout from the Fire\n\nEight days after state officials put the final piece of the new regulations into place, wildfires swept through Los Angeles.\n\nIn their aftermath, Mr. Lara imposed a 1-year moratorium on nonrenewals, but only in the fire-affected areas. It will expire in January 2026.\n\nInsurers already have applied to charge their residential customers $425 million in losses incurred by the FAIR plan in the January fires, based on the new pass-through approved by Mr. Lara. Consumer Watchdog has filed a lawsuit challenging those assessments.\n\nThe incentive to shed customers in risky areas remains in place for insurers that have yet to file for rate increases under the new system.\n\nSo far, five companies -- serving 20 percent of the California market -- - have filed for increases. Mr. Lara said that is a promising sign that the new incentives are luring insurers back.\n\nBut the total number of policies they say they will add in distressed areas -- 2,500 -- is not really a net gain, because it does not take into account the number of policies that some of those same companies dropped since the deal was announced.\n\nThose companies now stand to collect nearly $250 million in additional premiums. Each filed for rate increases just under the 7 percent threshold that would trigger the requirement for public hearings, and could seek additional increases later.\n\nPeople living in hazardous fire zones will probably see rate hikes much larger, since the rate filing is an average, Mr. Lara's spokesman said.\n\nMeanwhile, the number of homeowners resorting to the FAIR plan has not gone down, as hoped, but doubled. Operators of the plan last month asked for a rate increase of nearly 36 percent. Nor have home buyers found it any easier to obtain insurance. The percentage of realtors reporting that they had deals fall through for lack of insurance has more than doubled since 2023, to 16.6 percent.\n\nThe trends so far suggest that the regulatory package will do little to help homeowners get the coverage they need, said Jamie Court, Consumer Watchdog's president.\n\n\"This isn't the balanced deal the insurance commissioner sold to Californians,\" he said. \"It's a giant giveaway to insurers.\"\n\nMr. Lara said state officials will not know if the overhaul worked for another year, at least.\n\nIn the meantime, he said, he was grateful for the Times analysis, and had asked his staff to be on the lookout for the issues it raised. He said the state would make adjustments if needed.\n\n\"There's no guarantees,\" he said. \"But our current system doesn't have guarantees, either.\"\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this investigation, The New York Times obtained and analyzed a range of data sources.\n\nCalifornia's Department of Insurance publishes a list of ZIP codes and counties that meet the new insurance regulations' definition of \"distressed.\" The Times cross-referenced those designations with the state's fire hazard maps (focusing, as the regulations do, on \"high\" and \"very high\" risk zones), as well as a Federal Emergency Management Agency data set of building outlines. This allowed reporters to compare the number of homes inside those hazard zones versus outside of them. The Times used ZIP code boundaries published by the state's Department of Technology, ultimately based on boundaries sourced from TomTom, and excluded ZIP codes containing fewer than 100 single-family home structures from those analyses.\n\nTo obtain data on thousands of policies that were canceled by insurers, known as \"block nonrenewals\" in industry parlance, The Times examined regulatory filings submitted by insurers. (That information is not otherwise readily available because the Department of Insurance does not publish statistics on block nonrenewals.) The Times focused on filings by companies in California's three largest homeowners insurance groups, measured by total \"direct premiums written\" in 2023: State Farm Group, Farmers Insurance Group (which also owns Foremost Insurance), and CSAA. These filings indicate the number nonrenewals being undertaken or planned in each California ZIP code. Because insurers do not indicate the specific date any given nonrenewal was planned, The Times analyses focused on the dates insurers submitted the relevant filing exhibits.",

        "title": "Obama to rally Democrats in Virginia and New Jersey in weekend campaign push before Election Day",
        "description": "RICHMOND, Va. -- Former President Barack Obama will headline rallies Saturday for Democrats running for governor in Virginia and New Jersey, corralling voters ahead of elections that may signal the national mood 10 months into Donald Trump's second presidency and a year ahead of midterm elections that could reshape it.\n\nRepublicans in those states are stumping as well on the final weekend of campaigning before Tuesday's elections, but without the national star power.\n\nAnd on the west coast, California advocates are making a final push ahead of a statewide referendum over whether to redraw the state's congressional map in Democrats' favor. The effort backed by Gov. Gavin Newsom is part of a national redistricting battle that began when Trump urged GOP-run states to help him keep a friendly House majority in 2026.\n\nObama, the Democrat whom Trump succeeded when he first assumed the presidency, will appear first Saturday with Virginia's Democratic gubernatorial nominee Abigail Spanberger in Norfolk. Obama then travels to New Jersey for an evening rally with Democratic gubernatorial nominee Mikie Sherrill in Newark. Both events put the nation's first Black president in areas where Black voter turnout is key for Democratic victories.\n\nVirginia Republican nominee Winsome Earle-Sears, the current lieutenant governor, and New Jersey Republican Jack Ciattarelli, a former state lawmaker, have busy itineraries, as well.\n\nThe Virginia contest ensures the election of the first woman to lead the Commonwealth since its 1776 founding. If elected, Earle-Sears would be the first Black woman elected governor of any state.\n\nDemocratic Virginia House Speaker Don Scott brushed off questions about whether Obama was needed to help turn out Black voters who are key to Democrats' coalition of voters, saying his popularity spans racial lines.\n\n\"Black folks and white folks are inspired by his leadership. They're inspired by the way that he governed himself,\" said Scott, Virginia's first Black state House speaker.\n\nObama's campaign swing affirms how popular the 64-year-old remains among his party's base more than eight years removed from the White House. Yet it underscores Democrats' lack of current top leaders and surrogates, with Republicans holding all levers of federal power and a cadre of Democratic governors and lawmakers vying for status as national figures.\n\nAnd, Scott's protests aside, the visit highlights pressure on Democrats to maximize their diverse coalition after Trump chipped away in 2024 at Democrats' usual advantages among Black and Hispanic voters. Trump lost Virginia and New Jersey but narrowed the margins in both states from his 2020 loss to Democrat Joe Biden. Republicans believe New Jersey, especially, is ripe to continue that trend for Ciattarelli.\n\nTrump endorsed Ciattarelli and has said -- without naming Earle-Sears -- that he backs the GOP candidate for Virginia governor. The president conducted a phone rally for Ciattarelli. He has not campaigned in person for either nominee, despite traveling multiple times in recent months to his golfing resort in New Jersey.\n\nThat reflects the tightrope Republicans must walk: Trump remains intensely popular among the most conservative voters but has a more precarious standing with the rest of the electorate.\n\nSpanberger and Sherrill have tried to capitalize.\n\n\"Jack won't say one bad word about the president,\" Sherrill charged in a debate with Ciattarelli.\n\nCiattarelli countered that \"no matter who sits in the White House, my job is to stand up for the 9.3 million citizens of the state, and I will.\" He then played up his Trump ties. \"It's best to have a relationship with whoever occupies the White House,\" he said.\n\nEarle-Sears aligns herself with the president, and according to AdImpact data, Spanberger's biggest advertising investment has gone to spots that try to tie Earle-Sears to Trump.\n\nThe lieutenant governor will lead GOP turnout rallies Saturday in Republican-rich small towns, first in Abingdon in the southwest corner of Virginia, then in Purceville, in the state's northernmost reaches near the Pennsylvania border.\n\nCiattarelli has stops in Woodbridge, Westfield and Fairfield, an itinerary that puts him in the exurbs of Newark, then across the state in a considerably less densely populated, more Republican swath.\n\nSpanberger and Sherrill, both center-left Democrats who helped the party retake the U.S. House in the 2018 midterms during Trump's first term, have emphasized economic arguments.\n\nThey've pledged to tackle rising consumer costs and blasted Trump for failing to reduce prices as he promised in the 2024 campaign. In New Jersey, however, Ciattarelli has blamed Democrats for higher energy costs because outgoing Gov. Phil Murphy has been leading the state for two terms.\n\nThe Democratic candidates have blasted the Republicans' federal domestic policy and tax cut bill. In Virginia, Spanberger has highlighted Trump's Department of Government Efficiency and, to a lesser degree, the ongoing federal shutdown -- both of which have a disproportionate impact in a state that has more than 300,000 federal employees, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\nEarle-Sears has tried to pin the shutdown on Spanberger, arguing the former congresswoman should use her leverage with Virginia's Democratic U.S. senators. Both senators have voted against the GOP's spending extension bill as Democrats demand Republicans address looming health care cuts.\n\nAdditionally, the contests could offer some clues as to whether social issues carry any less weight with voters than in previous elections. Spanberger and Sherrill herald their support for abortion rights, Spanberger doing so in the last Southern state to make the procedure widely accessible. Earle-Sears counters with a focus on transgender policies, trying to frame Spanberger as out of step with mainstream voters in the same way Trump used the issue against Democrat Kamala Harris in 2024.\n\nWhile results in Virginia and New Jersey will be mere guideposts for the 2026 midterms, California stands to have the most immediate impact on the national landscape.\n\nVoters there are deciding whether to override a nonpartisan redistricting commission and approve a new congressional map that is intended to send five more Democrats to Washington.\n\nIt's a direct counter to neutralize Texas' plan, already approved, that was drawn to tilt five seats in that state to the Republican column. And more states have followed suit, putting the national map itself in flux in an unprecedented mid-decade scramble years after the usual post-census redistricting process.\n\nRepublicans began the current Congress with just a 220-215 advantage in the House. That means just a few seats could determine whether Trump enjoys outright GOP control in Washington for the duration of his presidency or faces a new Democratic majority that, if patterned after his first term, blocks his agenda, opens an investigation of his administration and considers articles of impeachment.",

        "description": "A protester holds a sign supporting Proposition 50 during a demonstration organized by immigrant rights, labor, and grassroots groups to protest federal immigration enforcement actions in Los Angeles, California, U.S., October 4. 2025. REUTERS/Daniel Cole\n\nOn Tuesday, Slate writer Shirin Ali reports nearly half the country will head to the polls to cast ballots on a range of major questions and offices. However, \"President Donald Trump just made a not-so-subtle power grab\" to complicate that vote in some blue states.\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi announced that federal monitors will be sent to California and New Jersey to ensure \"ballot security,\" said Ali, adding that the move has \"sparked fear on social media.\"\n\nCalifornia, in particular, is set to vote on Proposition 50, which is Gov. Gavin Newsom's (D) effort to hand control of the state's congressional maps to Democratic lawmakers in response to Republican gerrymandering efforts in Texas and elsewhere. If the measure is successful, the state would likely get five additional congressional seats to counter Texas's mid-decade gerrymander in an attempt to keep the U.S. House under Republican control.\n\nPreeminent elections expert Rick Hasen assured Slate that Bondi's observers \"are more bark than bite, likely intended to 'trigger' Democrats during the lead-up to a critical vote.\" However, this initial attempt to use federal officials to push unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud could lead to federal troops at polling places in the future.\n\n\"A few days after Bondi's initial announcement, California countered with its own message to the Trump administration,\" said Ali. \"State Attorney General Rob Bonta announced that California would send its own state election watchers to watch Bondi's watchers, while also calling out the Trump administration's motives.\n\nIt's a \"nesting-doll\" situation as watchers watch watchers, but Hasen said none of the election monitors will have much to do.\n\n\"I think there'll be a lot of people standing around doing nothing,\" he said, noting that of California's 58 counties, only five are being targeted.\n\nThankfully, the same states that Bondi is careful to target have built-in freedoms that allow voters to duck her election monitors.\n\n\"This is not normal,\" Hasen said, \"I do think we have to take seriously the possibility that people are going to have to get around federal troops if they want to be able to vote, which would be a good reason to vote early and not have to deal with these things on Election Day.\"",

        "title": "SNAP funding is set to lapse Nov. 1, leaving recipients empty-handed. Here's what experts say.",
        "description": "Mary Cunningham is a reporter for CBS MoneyWatch. Before joining the business and finance vertical, she worked at \"60 Minutes,\" CBSNews.com and CBS News 24/7 as part of the CBS News Associate Program.\n\nThe prolonged U.S. government shutdown is putting millions of Americans at risk of missing their November food stamp benefits, a vital lifeline for low-income households.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, said in a memo Sunday that no benefits will be issued on Nov. 1, leaving the program's roughly 42 million beneficiaries uncertain about how they'll pay for groceries next month.\n\nSNAP recipients receive an average of $187 a month on a prepaid card, and many families rely on those benefits as their main source of money for food. Many of those registered with the program are asking if they will still be able to use the remaining dollars on their cards once funding is suspended and if they'll receive their November benefits retroactively, should lawmakers reach a deal to reopen the government.\n\nA stoppage in SNAP payments on Nov. 1 isn't guaranteed. Two federal judges in Massachusetts and Rhode Island ruled on Friday, Oct. 31, that the Trump administration is required by law to use contingency funds to pay at least partial SNAP benefits.\n\nThe government must respond by Monday on whether it plans to allocate money to continue payments.\n\nWith just days to go before a potential suspension in SNAP funding, here's what to know.\n\nWhile SNAP benefits will not be disbursed as scheduled in November, program recipients can use existing funds on their EBT cards to make purchases. If someone enrolled in the program hasn't spent all their October EBT dollars, for example, those benefits would roll over into November.\n\nSome states are advising recipients to use their remaining food stamps wisely, given the stalemate over funding the federal government.\n\n\"If you have remaining balances from previous months, we encourage you to plan your shopping carefully and purchase essential food items when needed,\" Hawaii's Department of Human Services said on its website.\n\nThe USDA hasn't indicated whether SNAP benefits would be paid retroactively once the government shutdown ends.\n\nBut social service experts who spoke with CBS News said they expect the USDA to pay the delayed November benefits once federal funding resumes.\n\n\"It is our understanding that SNAP benefits will be issued retroactively when the shutdown ends,\" said Lizbeth Ginsburg, a managing attorney in the welfare law unit at Greater Boston Legal Services.\n\nFederal rules governing the food-stamp program stipulate that SNAP recipients are entitled to their benefits, and that they should receive them if there's a disruption, said Gina Plata-Nino, interim SNAP director at the Food Research & Action Center (FRAC), a nonprofit group focused on ending hunger.\n\n\"That's why many state agencies have done a very good job of saying, 'Your benefits will be delayed,' versus, 'You are not getting benefits,'\" she told CBS News.\n\nWhile SNAP is federally funded and overseen by the USDA, each state is responsible for administering the program to its residents.\n\nSome states are taking action, with Democratic lawmakers urging Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins to tap into an estimated $5 billion in contingency funds to cover SNAP benefits next month. On Tuesday, a coalition of officials from 25 states and the District of Columbia sued the Trump administration over the suspension of benefits, arguing that it is unlawful. The lawsuit notes that this would mark the first delay in SNAP benefits in the program's history.\n\nIn recent days, several states have pledged to step in to ensure SNAP recipients can afford food in November. Their approaches vary, with some states promising to dispatch troops to support food banks, while others are allocating funds for general hunger relief.\n\nLouisiana Gov. Jeff Landry signed an emergency declaration on Oct. 24 intended to fund SNAP benefits for people who rely on the program, while Vermont lawmakers on Oct. 29 approved a plan to cover its residents' food stamp benefits through Nov. 15.\n\nOther states say they plan to ramp up support for local food banks by providing on-site personnel and additional funding. California Gov. Gavin Newsom said last week he would deploy National Guard troops to assist food bank operations and fast-track $80 million to keep the state's food banks stocked.\n\nIn New York, Gov. Kathy Hochul said she is providing $30 million in state funding to support 16 million meals. Roughly 3 million people in New York are on food stamps.\n\nOther states that have announced actions to help SNAP recipients include Connecticut, Hawaii, Iowa, Minnesota, New Hampshire, Nevada, New Mexico, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Virginia and Washington.\n\nOfficials in these states are stepping in despite the USDA saying states lack the authority to cover benefits and won't be reimbursed.\n\n\"There is no provision or allowance under current law for states to cover the cost of benefits and be reimbursed,\" the agency said in its memo.\n\nPlata-Nino said that puts states in a difficult position, given their already limited reserves. It also diverts attention and funding from other priorities, she added.\n\n\"These are resources that could have gone to other places,\" she said.",

        "title": "Vogue World and Swarovski Honor Hollywood Costume's Influence; Fashion's FYC Season",
        "description": "Vogue World: Hollywood was a flex for the magazine and a long-overdue recognition of the influence film has on fashion. Also, Swarovski's must-see \"Masters of Light: Hollywood\" exhibition of fashion and costume is on display and open to the public until Nov. 3.\n\nWith Paramount Studios serving as a runway stage, Baz Luhrmann directing, a Chanel-clad Nicole Kidman starring, and a stacked celebrity cast and front row, Vogue World: Hollywood was a joyous mashup of fashion and film, featuring iconic Hollywood costumes, characters, fresh-off-the-runway fashion and archival looks.\n\nSay what you will about it being a pointless marketing exercise, and many online have said exactly that, but it was a rah-rah for both struggling industries, and a flex for Vogue, which is the only brand on the planet that could have pulled in all that star power. It also raised $4.5 million for the Entertainment Community Fund, providing a safety net for arts workers hit particularly hard this year.\n\nSunday's event brought 400-plus guests to the Paramount lot, including what were surely the most famous extras in history. \"Picture's up, places please, picture's up!\" a stage manager called over the bullhorn as they arrived on set.\n\n\"They're stressing everybody out because we all actually do this and when you say picture's up it's serious!\" Miley Cyrus said, walking in incognito wearing a Saint Laurent leather trench, newsboy cap and sunglasses.\n\n\"I'm looking for the next motion picture star!\" stylist Brad Goreski joked, looking every bit the studio boss in a dapper suit, sunglasses and slicked-back hair, arriving with Ashley Park in a corseted Wiederhoeft dress that carried a sense of costume.\n\nStars from music (Rita Ora, V, Machine Gun Kelly, Lizzo), film (Dakota Johnson, Gwyneth Paltrow, Cynthia Erivo, Taika Waititi), costume (Sandy Powell, Ruth E. Carter, Colleen Atwood), fashion (Anthony Vaccarello, Zac Posen, Jerry Lorenzo) and other power players in Anna Wintour's orbit (Gov. Gavin Newsom, Bryan Lourd, Tyler Perry, Casey Wasserman) strolled past props, costume rails and spotlights on their way to director's chair seats.\n\nThe runway was high-energy and fast -- people were having fun! -- which is something we need more of in fashion and worked well for the 35-minute livestream of the show. While it was confusing to figure out what was designer-made and what was costume, that may have been the point.\n\nThe art forms have blurred. Costume designers have dipped their toes into fashion design and collaborated with luxury brands on films, not to mention continually influencing runway and street style decade after decade. Meanwhile, fashion designers are casting Hollywood faces as brand ambassadors, bringing even more showmanship to their runway shows and clothing to reach digital audiences, and even stepping into producing and costuming Hollywood films.\n\nAll of it was on display on the runway.\n\nL.A.-based designers Kate and Laura Mulleavy were working in both worlds long before Anthony Vaccarello and Saint Laurent Films began producing awards-contending movies. They designed costumes for the 2010 film \"Black Swan,\" have cited the influence of films including \"Suspiria\" and \"Star Wars\" on many of their runway collections over the years, and made their own 2017 feature film, \"Woodshock.\" So it was fitting that several of their looks appeared on the Vogue World runway.\n\nThere used to be more of an impervious line between Hollywood costume and fashion; costume was for character building and serving a script, fashion was purely commercial. But all that's gone out the window, as the relationship between Hollywood and fashion has become symbiotic.\n\n\"In this era, people are able to step out of the boxes more and interact in the two fields simultaneously, and it's accepted and celebrated,\" Laura Mulleavy told me, noting that it was another polymath, Shirley Kurata, their longtime runway stylist and the costume designer for the 2022 film \"Everything Everywhere All At Once,\" who curated the evening's contemporary character costumes.\n\nThis recognition of costume designers' contributions to visual culture -- and to fashion, including countless collection mood boards -- was long overdue. I can't tell you how many times I've previewed a collection with a fashion designer who talks about being inspired by a particular film without naming, or even knowing, the costume designer. Hopefully, that mindset will start to change.\n\nThe photo below says it all about the flow of creativity and reference from one world to the other -- Wintour poses with costume designer Mona May and her iconic yellow plaid suit, as worn by Alicia Silverstone in the 1995 film \"Clueless,\" alongside a checked suit in the same spirit by fashion designer Thom Browne.\n\nThere was a lot to look at on the runway. Some of the highlights: Kendall Jenner as a \"Moulin Rouge!\" showgirl in a leggy look from costume designer Catherine Martin, and \"Great Gatsby\" flappers -- including Elizabeth Debicki -- wearing beaded gowns Martin created for the 2013 film in collaboration with Prada.\n\nThe tribute to the late, great style icon Diane Keaton and her influential \"Annie Hall\" look was not only touching but telling of how costume and fashion can intersect. It was originally developed by Keaton in 1977 with costume designer Ruth Morley, using some pieces from her personal wardrobe and some from Ralph Lauren, who recreated the look for the runway here, and has referenced it many times in his fashion collections over the years. There were also homages to the unforgettable costumes of \"The Royal Tenenbaums\" (Karen Patch), \"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\" (Arianne Phillips) and \"Edward Scissorhands\" (Colleen Atwood).\n\nAngela Bassett closed the Afrofuturism section looking regal in her Ruth E. Carter gown on the heels of dancing \"Black Panther\" Wakandan warriors. Greta Lee worked a theatrical look and tricorne hat from fashion/costume designer Jonathan Anderson's first Dior collection shown just weeks ago. Jeff Goldblum owned his Gucci sequin jacket and his runway walk, and Julia Garner skipped down the runway as the picture of baroque frivolity in a Milena Canonero for \"Marie Antoinette\" costume.\n\nGracie Abrams played the part of Chanel ambassador, performing in a fresh-off-the-runway look by Matthieu Blazy, while Doja Cat shook her hips in a chainmail dress inspired by Tina Turner in \"Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome,\" but executed by L.A.'s Michael Schmidt, a too-often unsung hero of costume design and fabrication. It was a blast and nobody wanted it to end.\n\nOn the way out, I ran into \"Frankenstein\" costume designer Kate Hawley, whose ravishing work, including curating Tiffany & Co. archival jewels and custom pieces for the film, is proof that the love affair between costume and fashion isn't ending anytime soon.\n\nBrands have descended on L.A. in what I'm calling fashion's FYC (For Your Consideration) period in the lead-up to awards season.\n\nEverything from Boucheron jewels and hot-off-the-runway Versace to designer Camilla Franks' fun, rock 'n' roll resortwear and Le Monde Beryl's red-carpet-ready silk pumps is being showcased for celebrities and stylists at spectacular events, rented hotel rooms and showrooms across the city. The goal? To create media moments, build relationships and make deals as opportunities to dress up, ramp up over the next few months.\n\nSwarovski joined the chorus Tuesday, asserting its role as chief embellisher of fashion and film. Global creative director Giovanna Engelbert and CEO Alexis Nasard hosted the opening of the Swarovski \"Masters of Light\" immersive exhibition -- following stops in Vienna, Milan, Shanghai and Seoul -- curated by Alexander Fury with a Hollywood focus for this edition.\n\nUnlike most fashion happenings, this is open to the public, through Nov. 3 in the former Amoeba Music space.\n\nCher, Viola Davis, Kylie Jenner, Elizabeth Olsen, Jeff Goldblum and many more turned out for the sparkly opening, exploring galleries showcasing Swarovski's 130 year history of bedazzling fashion, jewelry, home decor and more.\n\nThe brand has a century-long history in Hollywood, from lighting up Dorothy's ruby red slippers in \"The Wizard of Oz\" (there's a pair in the exhibition), to creating the jewels worn by Marilyn Monroe in \"Gentlemen Prefer Blondes\" (also here), to partnering with the Academy Awards, and on many a costume and red carpet dress.\n\nLike Vogue World, the exhibition is a conversation between fashion and costume -- and full of eye candy -- including the Jean-Louis and Bob Mackie-designed nude illusion dress worn by Monroe when she sang \"Happy Birthday\" to President John F. Kennedy, and by Kim Kardashian to the Met Gala, which had its own velvet-roped vestibule.\n\nDemonstrating how costumes have inspired fashion, Travis Banton's gold silk, glass bead, bullion, crystal and mink \"Faberg\u00e9\" dress -- said to be one of the most expensive ever produced by Paramount and worn by Marlene Dietrich in the 1937 film \"Angel\" -- is displayed next to a 2024 Marc Jacobs gown inspired by it.\n\n\"Masters of Light\" offers a window into the brand's craft and design process in vivid color, and many more show stopping looks, including Josephine Baker's incredible metal and crystal bra and feather costume from \"La Revue N\u00e8gre,\" Katy Perry's iconic Jeremy Scott chandelier dress, a crystallized Harry Styles jumpsuit and more worn by Cher, Madonna, Grace Jones, Beyonc\u00e9, Tina Turner, Carey Mulligan and more. Tickets can be purchased here.\n\nMeanwhile in New York, Messika jewelry celebrated its 20th anniversary, and the opening of a new Madison Avenue flagship, with a glittering dinner at The Frick Collection bringing together a cross-section of celebrities, fashion insiders and friends of the brand.\n\nMore than 120 guests, including Julianne Moore, Charlotte Lawrence, Nina Dobrev, Kiko Mizuhara, Orlando Bloom, and Gunna, gathered in the museum's galleries for an evening that blended haute joaillerie and haute cuisine.\n\nIn a clever twist, models dressed as servers and glided through the dining room in a trompe-l'\u0153il performance, revealing Messika's high jewelry pieces as they moved.\n\nThe centerpiece was the So Move Rainbow High Jewelry set, with 24 sapphire shades and rubies created exclusively for the new boutique. Rainbow hues ran throughout the event -- from the photo call backdrop to the table settings to the anniversary cake.\n\nProduced by We Are Ona, known for its immersive culinary events, the dinner featured a custom menu by Chef Alexia Duch\u00eane, and culminated in a soulful performance by Toni Braxton.\n\n\"This opening is more than a milestone,\" Val\u00e9rie Messika, who founded the modern jewelry brand in Paris in 2005, said. \"It's a bridge between Paris and New York, between savoir-faire and emotion, and the beginning of a luminous new chapter for Messika in the United States.\"\n\nFormer magazine editors Laura Brown and Kristina O'Neill have been crisscrossing the country with their new book, \"All The Cool Girls Get Fired,\" which I had the pleasure of interviewing them about onstage at Reese Witherspoon's Shine Away event a couple weekends back.\n\nIt's a timely read for people who, ahem, have been laid off, with personal anecdotes from Oprah, Katie Couric, Jamie Lee Curtis and others, as well as practical advice about COBRA and mental health -- all the fun stuff.\n\nThe authors were back in L.A. last week for a party at the Tory Burch store where Kiernan Shipka, Lake Bell, Jurnee Smollett and others took turns reading excerpts from the book. Monica Lewinsky stole the show, however, with her introduction: \"I don't mean to show anyone up, but I was fired from the White House!\"\n\nI asked guests for their getting-fired stories. Burch has never been fired (of course she hasn't). Cindy Crawford was asked to leave a Bruce Weber shoot once, but models don't get fired so much as they don't get booked, she said.\n\nStylist/manager/producer Jeanne Yang was fired from her job as a salesperson in the Bullocks Wilshire lingerie department way back when, which led her to Details magazine and eventually to styling -- a good thing in retrospect.\n\nA setback that was really a setup, as they say. Cheers to that.",

        "title": "What Tuesday's Elections Might Tell Us About Trump",
        "description": "He's not on the ballot, but the results could carry hints about the future of his movement.\n\nThe elections on Tuesday hardly seem to be top of mind for President Trump.\n\nHe has spent the last week crisscrossing Asia, talking trade, nuclear weapons and rare earths, and is headed to Florida this weekend. He has not appeared in person in any of the major states hosting elections, like New Jersey or California, to pump up his party's candidate or cause. In Virginia, where a weak Republican candidate for governor is lagging behind an impervious-looking Democrat, he's offered only a tepid endorsement late in the campaign.\n\n(This has not, of course, stopped Democrats from talking about him, either in California, where they are fighting to pass a ballot measure that could give them five more safe House seats, or anywhere else.)\n\nNone of this is unusual for a president in an off-year. But the contests -- particularly the governor's races in New Jersey and Virginia -- are essentially the opening salvos of the midterm elections. And even if Trump has relatively little to say about them, the results will offer signals about his political strength and his party's strength more broadly, as it considers ways to keep his supporters in the fold when he is barred from once again topping the ticket.\n\n\"Will those Trump voters become Republican voters?\" asked Mike DuHaime, a Republican strategist who worked on Chris Christie's successful off-year campaigns for New Jersey governor in 2009 and 2013. \"Do they think any other race, other than presidential, is important enough to come out for?\"\n\nHere are three story lines that show how even elections that aren't directly about Trump can't help but be a little Trumpy.\n\nCan a candidate win a blue state by sounding like Trump?\n\nWhen Jack Ciattarelli, a former state lawmaker and a Republican, first ran for governor of New Jersey in 2017, he cut a wonky profile and occasionally criticized Trump, who he knew repulsed swing voters.\n\nFast forward eight years -- and a second unsuccessful run for governor in 2021 -- and you have a candidate who has fundamentally shifted his approach, my colleague Nick Corasaniti wrote in a perceptive profile. Ciattarelli doesn't talk so much about Trump. But he talks like him, decrying \"open borders\" and appearing with vaccine skeptics and far-right Trump-backers like Jack Posobiec. Nick wrote:\n\nSuch an approach amounts to a bet not yet tested in a competitive election since Mr. Trump's return to power last year: that the margins in a close race can be made up by tacking closer to the Republican base in a general election, and that Trump supporters will turn out even without Mr. Trump atop the ticket.\n\nIt's a departure from the timeworn tactic of playing to the middle, and if it works in a blue state, it will say a lot about the staying power of Trump's political style.\n\nWill Trump's 2024 coalition stick around?\n\nCiattarelli's decision to tack so close to Trump reflects the president's performance there in 2024, when he lost to former Vice President Kamala Harris by less than six percentage points, but showed remarkable strength in the state's most diverse areas. Every single majority-Hispanic township in the state swung Trump's way between 2020 and 2024, by 25 percentage points on average.\n\nThat, Shane Goldmacher and Christine Zhang wrote, makes Tuesday's results in New Jersey an early test of whether that movement was \"evidence of a durable political and racial realignment or a passing phenomenon specific to Mr. Trump.\"\n\n\"New Jersey ends up being the first meaningful temperature check since the last election,\" said Carlos Odio, a Democratic pollster who specializes in studying Latino voting patterns and lives in New Jersey.\n\nCiattarelli appears to understand precisely what's at stake, campaigning frequently in Black and Latino areas that were once considered safe Democratic turf.\n\nWhat about the one race Trump can't quite quit?\n\nThere is no chance that a Republican is going to win New York City's mayor's race. But that hasn't kept Trump entirely away from the contest to govern his hometown.\n\nHe mulled getting involved to stop Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee, from winning. He spoke directly with former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, the Democrat and former Trump foil now running as an independent, about the race. His advisers discussed giving Mayor Eric Adams, the embattled Democratic incumbent, an administration job in exchange for dropping out (Adams eventually did drop out, sans job offer).\n\nNone of that has stopped the rise of Mamdani, a democratic socialist, but Trump has tried one more tactic: threatening the city with major cuts to federal funding if Mamdani is elected.\n\nTrump seems unlikely to change the outcome of the race. But the question for New York is how, if Mamdani is elected, the president might flex his power to shape the city itself.\n\nPOSTCARD FROM SACRAMENTO\n\n... and what Tuesday means for Gavin Newsom\n\nPolls suggest that California voters are likely to pass Gov. Gavin Newsom's redistricting measure on Tuesday, a win that could help Democrats flip five House seats next year -- and that could pay political dividends for Newsom, too. My colleague Laurel Rosenhall, who covers California government, explains.\n\nThe ballot measure was framed as a way to fight President Trump's mid-decade redistricting push with fire. But it could also serve as a foundation for a 2028 presidential campaign for Newsom himself.\n\nOver the course of the campaign, Newsom expanded a national list of supporters that helped him raise an astonishing $114 million in less than three months. The haul from small donations is especially notable, with $38 million from people across the country who responded to email and text message appeals.\n\nTheir contact information is on a list Newsom has been methodically building since his earliest days in politics. More than 25 years ago, as a member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, Newsom began collecting emails for a bond measure to fund San Francisco parks. Since then, he told me he's been disciplined about expanding and maintaining the list that he calls \"the most valuable asset\" of his political career.\n\nNewsom leveraged that asset to turn a state level redistricting measure into an attention-grabbing national campaign. And that's a platform he can draw on again in 2028, if he wants to.\n\nMore on redistricting\n\n* Proponents for California's new redistricting measure say voters are motivated by stopping Trump.\n\n* The Virginia legislature took the first step to redrawing Congressional maps to benefit Democrats in 2026.\n\n* Ohio is now the latest Republican-led state to redraw its congressional map to benefit the G.O.P.\n\nQUOTE OF THE DAY\n\n\"Leader Thune's position on the importance of the legislative filibuster is unchanged.\"\n\nThat's what a spokesman for John Thune, the Senate majority leader, told my colleague Carl Hulse on Friday, shutting down a demand from President Trump to dispose of the filibuster in order to end the government shut down.\n\nOn Thursday, Trump took to Truth Social to call for Senate Republicans to \"go for what is called the Nuclear Option.\"\n\n\"Get rid of the Filibuster, and get rid of it, NOW!\" he wrote.\n\nThune has weakened the filibuster, but he and other Senior Republicans fear that getting rid of it entirely would spectacularly backfire if Democrats regained control of the Senate.\n\nMore on Senate Republicans:\n\n* Senators opposed the president's plan to import Argentine beef and voted three times this week to end his power to enforce sweeping tariffs, indicating growing Republican angst over Trump's trade agenda.\n\nThe Moment\n\nReady for a surprise\n\nIt was the end of President Trump's five-day visit to three countries in Asia -- a tour packed with extravagant welcome dinners, an aircraft rally and the gift of a replica gold crown -- and The New York Times's photographer Haiyun Jiang thought she was done for the day.\n\nShe had already photographed Trump and Xi Jinping of China shaking hands, and watched them recede into the bilateral meeting the whole trip had built up to. She and the other photographers had been told they wouldn't see the two men together again.\n\nBut, about 90 minutes into Trump and Xi's meeting, the media was told that the plan had changed, and the two men were coming out once more -- together. That's when Haiyun took this photo showing Trump whispering some final words to a smiling Xi, as the men in his delegation solemnly looked on.\n\nHaiyun keeps cameras on her all the time in the event of surprises like this. That happened earlier on the trip, too, when Air Force One flew from Tokyo to Busan, and the captain told the passengers that they would soon be able to see a spectacular view of Mt. Fuji.\n\nHaiyun, of course, had two cameras at hand, slung over the seat in front of her, poised to capture the unexpected.",

        "title": "Democrats Confident in Final Days of California Proposition 50 Redistricting Election",
        "description": "A small army of union canvassers fanned out across a Los Angeles neighborhood, clad in purple and ready for a challenge.\n\nFour months ago, none of them expected to be here. There was no election on the calendar, and redistricting was something that happened near the start of each decade in California. But here they were, trying to convince voters to support an esoteric measure that was placed on the ballot in August and aimed at redrawing California's congressional maps.\n\nThey turned to a simple pitch: This is your chance to fight back against President Trump.\n\nIt wasn't a hard sell.\n\nCalifornia voters are well aware of the role their state is playing in the national redistricting war that began this summer when Mr. Trump asked Texas Republicans to deliver five more seats through gerrymandering.\n\nOrdinarily, campaigns struggle to energize voters for an off-year special election like this one in California. But as the union canvassers found, Democrats here see Proposition 50 as the latest referendum on Mr. Trump, who remains deeply unpopular in the state. If it passes, the measure could help Democrats oust as many as five Republican House members next year in California.\n\nFour days before the election, Democrats are feeling unusually confident in California. Polls show the measure passing by a healthy margin. Trailing in fund-raising by a wide amount, Republicans have all but abandoned the airwaves while Democrats are running ads that feel like something of a victory lap, featuring a who's who of national party leaders, including former President Barack Obama and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom, who championed Proposition 50, has raised at least $114 million, roughly double what Republicans have accumulated. He has so much money that he asked small donors to stop giving more than a week before the election.\n\n\"We are fighting fire with fire,\" Mr. Newsom told union members in San Jose this month. \"We are fighting back. And we will win.\"\n\nRepublicans have tried to sell voters on the ideals of independent redistricting, emphasizing that Democrats are trying to manipulate the process by sidelining the state panel that determines the congressional map according to nonpartisan guidelines. And former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, who is no fan of Mr. Trump, has spoken out against Proposition 50. But their message has been complicated by the fact that Republicans in Texas and other states have pursued the same gerrymandering efforts and turned their nuclear redistricting key first.\n\nAnd Democrats still find that one message resonates above all others. \"STOP TRUMP,\" urged the campaign literature distributed by Service Employees International Union canvassers.\n\nIn the working-class Latino neighborhood of Pico-Union in Los Angeles, residents said they were angry that Mr. Trump was targeting Latino people for deportation.\n\n\"We're not letting him win,\" said Jennye Roman, 49, who told the canvassers that she was eager to vote for Proposition 50. \"We're tired of him stepping all over our families. These are our people.\"\n\nThe door-knockers showed up ready to inform and persuade, aware that the average person might not be closely following headlines or steeped in the minutiae of midterm elections. But nearly everyone they encountered on an overcast October morning said they were at least somewhat aware of the ballot measure -- and ready to vote for it.\n\nAmong those knocking on doors was David Huerta, the California president of S.E.I.U. He was arrested in June during a protest in Los Angeles against Mr. Trump's immigration raids, a day before the president ordered National Guard troops to the city.\n\nHe said that voters in Los Angeles seemed to be paying closer attention to this election than they did to last year's presidential race.\n\n\"This community's suffered as a result of the federal operations that have happened,\" Mr. Huerta said. \"So they get it.\"\n\nOf course, the door-knockers were on friendly terrain, walking past old \"Bernie 2020\" signs still sitting in windows. Elsewhere in California, Republicans were frustrated that Democrats were trying to eliminate what little representation they had left in the state.\n\nDemocrats hold 43 House seats, compared with nine for Republicans in California. Proposition 50 could help Democrats win as many as five more, partly by splitting up Republican districts in Northern California and combining them with liberal areas like Marin County and Sonoma County.\n\nRyan Schohr, a rice and walnut farmer in Butte County, a rural region north of Sacramento, said he was happy with Representative Doug LaMalfa, the Republican who currently represents the area and is a rice farmer himself.\n\nBut under Proposition 50, Mr. Schohr's district would lose some conservative areas and add Democratic voters in Sonoma County near the coast.\n\nMr. Schohr, 48, said he feared the changes would result in farmers like himself being represented by someone living far away, without an understanding or concern for rural issues.\n\n\"I think that a Republican represents this area's interests much better than a Bay Area person can,\" Mr. Schohr said.\n\nWhile polls show a solid lead for Proposition 50, it can be difficult to predict turnout in an off-year special election. Opponents of the measure said they remained optimistic, even though they were being vastly outspent on the airwaves and had fewer volunteers on the ground.\n\n\"We're continuing to turn out supporters and educate persuadable voters, obviously knowing we're being outspent two to one,\" said Amy Thoma Tan, a spokeswoman for an opposition group funded by Charles Munger Jr., a wealthy Republican who has long supported independent redistricting. \"We're definitely still running through the finish line.\"\n\nStill, Republicans have already begun pointing fingers, criticizing Kevin McCarthy, the former House speaker who led one of the opposition campaigns, for not raising enough money. Compared with the Yes on 50 campaign's anti-Trump message, the opposition effort felt disjointed, ranging from taking shots at Mr. Newsom to praising the fairness of the current independent mapmaking panel.\n\nThe No on 50 groups have been outspent on television, $90 million to $34 million, according to the tracking firm AdImpact, and the disparity grew even more extreme during the crucial final month when Californians were filling out their mail ballots. After an initial ad binge in September, Mr. Munger's committee has spent less than $6,000 on TV ads this month.\n\nCalifornia Democrats have planned a series of campaign events for the final weekend before Tuesday's election, designed to motivate volunteers and generate coverage on local television stations. Union members across the state are planning to make phone calls and knock on doors.\n\nEarlier this month, Representative Hakeem Jeffries, the House minority leader, and Ken Martin, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, each visited Los Angeles to support Proposition 50. Mr. Martin called it \"a really critical priority\" for Democrats nationally.\n\nNational Republicans have not responded in kind. House leadership has given money to the California Republican Party, but party leaders have been far less vocal on Proposition 50. Mr. Trump has scarcely weighed in, criticizing early voting and mail-in ballot options in a Truth Social post this month, but not the measure itself.\n\nThat has left embattled Republican House members in California as the face of the opposition.\n\nRepresentative Kevin Kiley, a Republican whose Sacramento district would see an infusion of Democratic neighborhoods under the new map, has called for a nationwide ban on all mid-decade redistricting because, he has said, Americans oppose the gerrymander war between states. The idea has gone nowhere.\n\nStill, Mr. Kiley said he was encouraged that polling showed California voters still supported independent redistricting in concept, even as they also backed Proposition 50.\n\n\"At least that part of it is heartening to me: that despite the barrage of messaging convincing Californians that gerrymandering is somehow good for our state, people are not persuaded by that message,\" he said.\n\nNational Republicans may have concluded that the fight in California was costly and close to unwinnable, and that it was better to focus on convincing other states to redraw their maps instead, some strategists said. Even if California neutralizes the Texas gerrymander, Mr. Trump has convinced other Republican-led states, like North Carolina and Missouri, to follow suit.\n\n\"It could be that they decided that they're going to pick up so many seats in red states that it wasn't necessary,\" said Duane Dichiara, a Republican political consultant in California who is unaffiliated with the Proposition 50 fight. \"Plus, all these California seats are so expensive to defend.\"",

        "description": "American Truckers United co-founders Harvey Beech and Shannon Everett join 'Fox & Friends' to expose how illegal immigrants are obtaining U.S. trucking licenses without proper qualifications.\n\nTruckers are sounding the alarm over illegal immigrants being granted commercial driver's licenses, warning that relaxed licensing standards amid a nationwide driver shortage have created a safety crisis on America's highways.\n\n\"Our American truck driver community, they have been complaining about the foreign invasion of their industry and the things they're having to deal with on a daily basis,\" said Harvey Beech, co-founder of American Truckers United, on \"Fox & Friends\" Friday.\n\nBoth Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy have taken aim at sanctuary states for allegedly allowing illegal immigrants to obtain commercial driver's licenses. The crackdown follows several high-profile traffic incidents involving truck drivers in the U.S. illegally.\n\nOn Thursday, Noem announced more than 200 illegal immigrants were taken off the road as part of \"Operation Midway Blitz.\" That included 46 semi-truck drivers and 82 migrants who drove other vehicles such as buses, box trucks, or moving vans.\n\nWHITE HOUSE SAYS CALIFORNIA GRANTED LICENSE TO ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT TRUCKER CHARGED IN FATAL DUI CRASH\n\nShe said the commercial licenses were issued in more than a dozen states.\n\n\"This has really exploded over the last five years,\" said Shannon Everett, another co-founder of American Truckers United.\n\n\"There's been an effort across the industry to reduce standards to solve a so-called driver shortage. In doing so, they relaxed the standards for these driver's licenses to be issued, but only in certain states.\"\n\nILLEGAL IMMIGRANT TRUCK DRIVER IN FATAL CALIFORNIA CRASH SHOULD NEVER HAVE HAD LICENSE: DOT REPORT\n\nBoth Noem and Duffy have singled out states such as California, accusing Gov. Gavin Newsom of enabling immigrants in the country illegally to obtain commercial licenses. Duffy said federal officials are targeting \"CDL mills\" that issued commercial driver's licenses without proper oversight.\n\nEverett urged the public to look closer at the trucking companies hiring unqualified drivers, many of which, he said, are based in sanctuary states like Illinois, New York, and California.\n\n\"People would be amazed, the Americans would be amazed at how many new trucking companies are created each and every month and who is it that owns these trucking companies,\" he said.\n\nWHISTLEBLOWER WARNS ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS ARE SENDING 'SHOCKWAVE' THROUGH CRUCIAL INDUSTRY\n\n\"The real question I think America needs to start asking in each one of these wrecks is whose freight was on the truck, and why are these shippers not being held responsible for loading people that can't even speak English?\" Everett added.\n\nRenewed scrutiny over licensing standards follows a deadly Oct. 21 crash along a Southern California freeway, where 21-year-old Indian national Jashanpreet Singh allegedly drove a semi-truck while under the influence, triggering a multi-car pileup that killed three people.\n\nNewsom's office has blamed federal policies for the incident and insisted California's commercial driver's license laws comply with federal regulations.\n\nCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"Lost in the immigrant-bashing is the fact that drivers holding a California-issued CDL are involved in fatal crashes at a rate far lower than the national average,\" a Newsom spokesperson previously told Fox News Digital.\n\n\"If the focus were on safety, California should be a poster child, not a scapegoat.\"",

        "description": "President Donald Trump and U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA), shake hands as Trump leaves following an event honoring the LSU baseball NCAA national champions and the LSU-Shreveport baseball NAIA national champions at the White House in Washington, D.C. on Oct. 20, 2025. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque\n\nA GOP member of Congress slammed his own party in an interview with The New York Times' \"The Daily\" podcast on Friday, responding to claims that \"party leaders are willing to sacrifice you.\"\n\nRep. Kevin Kiley (R-CA) was elected in 2022 in California's 3rd District and is openly frustrated with his party's handling of the government shutdown and how the House isn't in session -- but that's not all he's upset over.\n\nHe's also against redistricting, which is now endangering his own seat in the House, and called it \"incredibly destabilizing\" especially when it happens mid-decade.\n\n\"I said from the moment this was on my radar that it shouldn't be happening anywhere. I'm against it in Texas, I'm against it in California. It's pure political opportunism,\" Kiley said.\n\nAs a result of Texas redistricting, a demand President Donald Trump made in an effort to keep Republican control over the House, the move could result in Kiley getting drawn out of his own district in California as Gov. Gavin Newsom retaliates to Trump's order to redistrict in Texas by responding in California.\n\nKiley still thinks he can win reelection, although his district might look different.\n\n'It sounds like your party leaders are willing to sacrifice you -- in theory -- for the party's ongoing control of Congress and refusing to entertain the idea to introduce a bill that would stop that,\" host Michael Barbaro said.\n\n\"I don't know what their motivations are, but their inaction is frustrating, certainly,\" Kiley said.\n\nKiley is one of five Republicans in California \"who are all but certain to lose their seats in the next midterm elections if voters grant final approval to Gov. Gavin Newsom's newly drawn congressional districts,\" according to The Times.\n\nHe thinks the Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) needs to bring the House back and has had private conversations with him about it.\n\n\"I don't know what his real reason is... I haven't gotten any explanation that makes sense to me,\" Kiley said.",

        "description": "Andrew here. If there was any doubt about the tech giants' business strategy to spend heavily, this week's earning reports suggest it will continue apace -- at least for now. We drill into the numbers below.\n\nWe're also assessing what's missing from the trade truce between the U.S. and China, and the last-minute surge in money from New York's business community to back Andrew Cuomo in next week's mayoral election. We also speak with Oura's C.E.O. about how he's using A.I.\n\nAmazon calms the market\n\nThe artificial intelligence rally is storming back on Friday on renewed hopes that Big Tech's gigantic investments in A.I. are paying off.\n\nThe focus is on Apple and Amazon, whose strong quarterly results Thursday are propelling Nasdaq Composite Index futures higher.\n\nThe fortunes of both businesses are being closely watched, especially for what they say about how corporate America and consumers are faring amid President Trump's trade war. Amazon's bullish take on A.I. growth also calmed investors' nerves.\n\nLet's start there. Amazon shares, which have lagged the company's so-called Magnificent Seven peers all year, rose more than 12 percent in premarket trading. The e-commerce giant blew past Wall Street estimates, buoyed by growth in its consumer and cloud businesses.\n\nThe big takeaways:\n\n* Sales topped $180 billion last quarter, and its profit soared 38 percent, to $21.2 billion.\n\n* Revenues for the Amazon Web Services cloud business, a major profit driver, reached $33 billion for the quarter, up 20 percent from a year earlier. Andy Jassy, Amazon's C.E.O., said the division \"is growing at a pace we haven't seen since 2022.\"\n\n* The company spent more than $34 billion on capital expenditures last quarter. Amazon is on track to exceed $125 billion in capital exenditure investments for the year, mostly on data centers that power cloud computing and A.I.\n\n* Rufus, its shopping chatbot, is on pace to generate an additional $10 billion in sales this year, alleviating some doubts about the company's ability to monetize its A.I. investment.\n\nShares in Apple are also gaining. That is after the company gave an upbeat forecast for iPhone sales. It also notched $101.5 billion in revenues last quarter, a record, and a profit of $26.3 billion. On the downside, its China sales underwhelmed.\n\nInvestors have given Apple a pass so far on its more conservative A.I. strategy. That could change soon. \"They have to show they have a plan to move the needle for the next few years with A.I.,\" Thomas Plumb, president of Wisconsin Capital Management, told The Times.\n\nStill, investors are feeling more optimistic. On Thursday, Meta shares plunged after the company reported lackluster quarterly results and rising costs. The company is committing billions -- and reportedly plans to borrow billions more -- to build data centers to power its A.I. ambitions. It's part of a group of high-spending tech companies known as the hyperscalers, which are forecast to spend roughly $2.8 trillion in A.I.-related infrastructure investment through 2029, according to analysts at Citigroup.\n\nHERE'S WHAT'S HAPPENING\n\nThe Jeffrey Epstein ordeal continues to hit the rich and powerful. Weeks after the convicted sex offender died in 2019, JPMorgan Chase alerted the U.S. government to huge money flows that were potentially suspicious transactions involving Epstein and prominent Wall Street and business figures, The Times reports. Prince Andrew, a member of Britain's royal family, is also facing more blowback from his ties to the disgraced financier: Buckingham Palace announced that he would be stripped of his royal title and evicted from his sprawling residence.\n\nNetflix reportedly hires a bank to explore a bid for parts of Warner Bros. Discovery. The company has hired Moelis & Company, the investment bank that advised Skydance Media on a bid for Paramount, to evaluate its possible offer for Warner Bros. Discovery's Hollywood studio and streaming business, according to Reuters. Neither company commented on the report, but Netflix's C.E.O., Ted Sarandos, has said the streaming giant has no interest in Warner Bros. Discovery's cable TV networks.\n\nChina's factory production shows more signs of weakness. Manufacturing activity in China's factories fell again in October, making the slump the longest in more than nine years. The cut and delay in U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods announced after talks between President Trump and Xi Jinping, China's leader, offers manufacturers hope for a surge in orders, but China's economy will probably need more government stimulus to reverse the slowdown, analysts say.\n\nGrading the Trump-Xi talks\n\nInvestors and business leaders are still piecing through the framework trade truce hammered out by President Trump and Xi Jinping of China on Thursday.\n\nTrump hailed the talks as a victory, while China was more measured.\n\nA recap: China agreed to buy millions of tons of U.S. soybeans and ease its toughest export restrictions on rare-earth metals. Among the U.S. concessions, Washington agreed to remove thousands of Chinese firms from a so-called entity list that restricts their access to advanced technology.\n\nBut several omissions stand out, Grady McGregor reports.\n\nThe artificial intelligence chips question: Semiconductors came up in talks with Xi, Trump said on Thursday, but there was no clear resolution on the more burning question of Nvidia's future in China. The U.S. has long banned exports of the most advanced A.I. chips, including Nvidia's Blackwell processors, to Chinese companies on national security grounds. Beijing in turn has instructed local companies to rely on domestically produced chips.\n\nBefore the talks, Trump suggested he would ease the ban -- which Jensen Huang, Nvidia's C.E.O., has argued hampers American A.I. development -- helping to propel the company's shares to a $5 trillion market valuation. Trump has embraced Huang since the start of his second term, seeing Nvidia as key to the U.S. dominating the A.I. marketplace.\n\nBut in the end, Trump said he told Xi the matter was \"really between you and Nvidia, but we're sort of the arbitrator or the referee.\"\n\nAnd then there is the matter of America's overseas interests. Washington has been leaning on its allies to enforce its entity list and restrict Chinese firms from accessing advanced technology. They were probably blindsided to learn that the U.S. had agreed to suspend some of those restrictions for a year, analysts said.\n\n\"Any U.S. partner may be saying: You're writing into our trade deals that we need to align with you on export controls. At the same time, you just reversed a major export control move,\" Reva Goujon, a director at Rhodium Group, told DealBook.\n\nWhat's next? After a day digging through the details, analysts said the framework agreement was more of a temporary cease-fire than an endpoint in trade negotiations.\n\nOn the optimistic end, the trade truce will \"lend some momentum to future dialogues,\" Joe Mazur, a senior analyst at Trivium China, told DealBook. Others were not impressed. \"This is a microdeal,\" said Isaac Stone Fish, the C.E.O. of the business intelligence firm Strategy Risks. \"It will not last.\"\n\nBig Money's last-minute Cuomo push\n\nThere are just days to go until New York City's mayoral election, and Zohran Mamdani maintains a double-digit lead over Andrew Cuomo in the polls.\n\nBut some of Cuomo's backers, including Mike Bloomberg, are still throwing money behind Cuomo, New York's former governor, Lauren Hirsch writes.\n\nThe big question: Will it be enough to derail Mamdani, the democratic socialist whose policies around taxes and rent control, have rattled New York's business leaders?\n\n\"This election is very winnable for Andrew,\" the financiers Ricky Sandler, Richard Mack and Marty Burger wrote in a new email to donors, obtained by The Times. \"We need your help to close the gap!\"\n\nThey said they planned to use remaining funds in a super PAC backing Cuomo for get-out-the-vote efforts. One target: older voters in the Bronx and Staten Island.\n\nBloomberg has also moved off the sidelines. The former New York City mayor on Wednesday donated $1.5 million to a super PAC supporting Cuomo's bid. That's after he spent more than $8 million on Cuomo's failed bid to become the Democratic nominee. In September, as Mamdani became a clear front-runner in the polls, Bloomberg hosted him at his Midtown Manhattan headquarters.\n\nBut Bloomberg is all-in on Cuomo, saying he \"has the experience and toughness to stand up for New Yorkers and get things done.\"\n\nCuomo's camp has been buoyed by reports of robust early voting turnout among older voters. Polls show this group is more likely to support Cuomo, who's 67, than younger New Yorkers.\n\nBurger, Mack and Sandler question the accuracy of the forecasts showing Mamdani with such a large lead. \"We don't believe the polls have been a good indicator of what will happen in this election and the early voting data is confirming that view,\" they wrote in their latest email to donors.\n\nIs it too late? Polymarket, the prediction markets platform, on Friday gave Mamdani 95 percent odds of winning. And DealBook heard from one recipient of a pitch from the pro-Cuomo PAC who said he was on the fence about donating to Cuomo, thinking his money would not be enough to sway the outcome.\n\nTalking A.I. with the C.E.O. of Oura\n\nEvery week, we're asking a chief executive how he or she uses generative artificial intelligence. Tom Hale, who leads the wearable technology company Oura Health, told DealBook he often asks a chatbot to prompt him instead of the other way around. His answers have been condensed and edited.\n\nHow do you personally use A.I.?\n\nThe thing that I've found most valuable is a tactic that was described to me by Geoff Woods, who wrote \"The Ai-Driven Leader.\" You set a context, you give it a role. For example, I'm the C.E.O. of Oura, and you're Steve Jobs; then you say, \"Ask me 10 questions about this topic.\" After the interview, you say, \"Based on my answers, give me a task to do.\"\n\nIt was sort of a revelation because I was using it in this very typical way -- as a tool to do things and do them faster. This way, I'm not just prompting the A.I., the A.I. is prompting me.\n\nHave you given any directives to your companies or direct reports about what you want them to do with A.I.?\n\nIt's more carrot than stick. I want to see you show me you have the ideas and the passion and the desire to use these tools in an interesting and novel way.\n\nWe've hired a group of people to be a center of excellence, to make sure we're using the right tools and doing it with the right governance and respect for privacy. But it's not that you have to go to the A.I. department to get some A.I. The center of excellence is there to say, \"If you're not thinking about this, you should.\" Or, \"Here's a tool that we're providing.\"\n\nIt's \"let a thousand flowers bloom.\"\n\nTHE SPEED READ\n\nDeals\n\n* N.B.A. owners gave the go-ahead for Mark Walter, the billionaire investor, to buy the Los Angeles Lakers in a sale valuing the team at $10 billion.

        "title": "Key Trump agency vows to claw back over $1B benefitting illegals in blue states: 'Won't tolerate it'",
        "description": "FIRST ON FOX: The Trump administration is planning to claw back over $1 billion in federal Medicaid dollars they say are being spent by blue states on healthcare for illegal immigrants, including some with violent criminal records for murder and rape.\n\nA preliminary audit by Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services found that over the last few years, mostly during 2024 and 2025, California, Washington, D.C., Illinois, Washington, Colorado and Oregon, improperly spent a combined $1,351,204,127 in federal Medicaid funds to help pay for healthcare for illegal immigrants.\n\nWhile federal Medicaid dollars are supposed to be prohibited broadly from being used to cover healthcare for illegal immigrants, they can be used by states for emergency treatment regardless of a patient's citizenship or immigration status. States can also legally cover health insurance for illegal immigrants, so long as it is only done with state tax dollars. But, according to some experts, Democrats are utilizing loopholes in the federal laws that allow them to provide comprehensive health benefits to illegal immigrants.\n\n\"Protecting Medicaid from waste, fraud, and abuse isn't optional -- it's the law. Every dollar misspent on illegal health care spending is a dollar taken from vulnerable Americans,\" CMS spokesperson Emily Hilliard, told Fox News Digital. \"Federal law forbids using Medicaid funds for illegal immigrants, yet several Democrat-led states did it anyway. The Trump Administration won't tolerate it. CMS is auditing aggressively, recovering every dollar, and holding states accountable.\"\n\nDR. OZ ACCUSES DEMOCRATS OF 'GASLIGHTING' AMERICANS OVER $1B IN MEDICAID PAYMENTS TO ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS\n\nCalifornia was far-and-away the biggest culprit, which single-handedly spent over $1 billion in federal Medicaid dollars on healthcare for illegal immigrants, according to CMS. The next largest violator was Illinois, which CMS said has improperly spent nearly $30 million, followed by Oregon, which the audit found improperly spent approximately $5.5 million.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom's office has denied claims that his state is improperly using federal funds to pay for illegal immigrant healthcare, telling the Los Angeles Times that these claims from Republicans are \"false.\"\n\nBut, Steve Hilton, a former Fox News anchor and current Republican candidate running to be the next Governor of California after Newsom is term-limited out, has argued that California has been using a complex Medicaid provision known as a \"provider tax\" to obtain matching federal dollars, which then gets pooled into the money used by the state to pay for its healthcare offered to undocumented immigrants. Meanwhile, Chris Pope, a public health policy expert at the Manhattan Institute, has argued California is abusing federal provisions that allow states to use federal Medicaid dollars for emergency care for undocumented aliens.\n\nFox News Digital reached out to Newsom's office for comment on this story, but did not receive a response.\n\nCALIFORNIA USING BACK DOOR TO GET FEDERAL FUNDS FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT HEALTHCARE, GOP SAYS; DEMS SAY NONSENSE\n\n\"Medicaid is by far the largest source of federal funding for states. It was originally intended to only provide aid for eligible beneficiaries, but over time states have figured out how to game the system -- padding permitted expenses and diverting the profits to fund activities which are supposedly prohibited,\" said Pope. \"Any claim that state healthcare expenditures don't ultimately involve some form of federal funds should be regarded with suspicion.\"\n\nJim O'Neill, the current Acting Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and a Deputy Secretary at the Health and Human Services Department, has also been highlighting that among the federal funds that are improperly going to illegal immigrants, some are even going to illegal immigrants with violent criminal pasts. O'Neill has been posting a daily \"MorningMedicaidMugshot\" with examples over the last several days.\n\nOn Oct. 29, O'Neill highlighted Layth Kamil, a 24-year-old illegal alien from Iraq, convicted of exposing himself to a 15-year-old, who, according to O'Neill, has received close to $16,000 in taxpayer-funded healthcare through Medicaid. The day before, O'Neill highlighted the story of Haissam Massalkhy, a 45-year-old illegal alien from Lebanon, convicted after driving under the influence and killing an American citizen who was out jogging. Massalkhy has received over $30,000, according to O'Neill.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nOther illegal aliens O'Neill highlighted included folks convicted of attempted murder and child rape.\n\n\"Democrats are demanding continued funding of this violent illegal alien's Medicaid as a condition for reopening the government and paying the hardworking public servants at my department,\" O'Neill lamented in one of his recent \"MorningMedicaidMugshot\" posts.",

        "title": "California girls' volleyball players speak out on refusing to play in playoff game against trans athlete",
        "description": "Joint statement cites Christian faith and fairness concerns after 10 other teams forfeited against Jurupa Valley\n\nNEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles!\n\nA California high school girls' volleyball on Oct. 22 was the subject of national attention due to the presence of a transgender athlete. Two female players on the opposing team refused to take the court that night have now come forward to speak about their decision.\n\nJurupa Valley High School, which rostered the trans athlete AB Hernandez on its girls' team, lost to Valencia High School in straight sets in front of a wielding \"Save Girls Sports\" gear. It marked the end of Jurupa's controversial season, which had been marred by at least 10 forfeits, and Hernandez's high school volleyball career.\n\nThe parents of two female players for Valencia who chose not to play that night provided a joint statement, written by the two girls, to Fox News Digital on the condition of anonymity.\n\n\"On October 18, our team was informed that we would be playing Jurupa Valley High School in Round 1 of CIF. When scouting the team, we quickly realized that they had a transgender player who we would be competing against on October 22. Ten other teams had previously forfeited against Jurupa, which alarmed our team and led us to consider whether we should play or not,\" the statement began.\n\n\"Due to our beliefs and values, we decided to sit out and not attend our first-round CIF (California Interscholastic Federation) game. We believe that allowing males in women's sports is unfair, creates safety concerns, and goes against our faith. We value fair competition and integrity in volleyball, and our hope is to continue playing the sport we love without having to be in a position where we know the situation is wrong.\"\n\nThe two girls went on to cite their Christian faith as a reason for not playing, and insisted their actions were not aimed directly at Hernandez.\n\n\"As Christians, our decision to sit out of this game was not hard to make, but it was uncomfortable being the only ones to do so. We chose not only to sit out from playing, but also not to attend the game, as a way to show our stance and our disagreement. Our goal was not to single out AB Hernandez, but to express our belief that biological males should not compete in women's sports,\" the statement continued.\n\n\"Our decision was not made out of hate or discrimination toward anyone, but rather from our conviction in fairness and faith. It is our hope that the integrity of women's sports is honored and preserved.\"\n\nThe Oct. 22 match wasn't even Hernandez's first playoff high school volleyball game. Hernandez had competed for Jurupa Valley each of the last three years and went to the postseason in 2024 as well.\n\nBut the added national attention and controversy befell the team this year after Hernandez was thrust into the center of a political conflict between President Donald Trump and California Gov. Gavin Newsom at the end of the track and field season in the spring.\n\nHernandez made a run to the girls' state finals in long jump, triple jump and high jump, prompting Trump to send a Truth Social post in the days ahead of the event warning Newsom and the state not to allow a trans athlete to compete in the girls' events. Trump signed an executive order to prohibit schools from allowing biological males to play in girls' sports in February, but the California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) has persistently defied it.\n\nInstead, the CIF changed its rules to award any female athlete who competed in the same events as Hernandez a spot in the competition or one spot higher on the medal podium if they finished behind a biological male athlete.\n\nHernandez went on to take first place in high jump and triple jump, and second place in long jump.\n\nThe rule change resulted in Hernandez sharing podium spots with female athletes who finished behind the trans athlete in the state finals.\n\nThen, shortly after this year's volleyball season began, two of Jurupa Valley's senior players, McPherson and Hadeel Hazameh, from the team in protest of the trans athlete.\n\nMcPherson and Hazameh have also against the Jurupa Unified School District citing their experience playing and sharing a locker room with Hernandez the previous three seasons. McPherson's older sister and former JVHS girls' volleyball player Madison McPherson is the third plaintiff in that lawsuit.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice filed a lawsuit against the CIF and California Department of Education in July for refusing to change its transgender policies to comply with Trump's \"Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports\" executive order, weeks after Hernandez's track and field championships.\n\nAnd now with the fall sports season coming to a close, Hernandez is still eligible to compete in one more girls' track and field season in the spring.\n\nJackson Thompson is a sports writer for Fox News Digital.

        "description": "Julie Sharp is a digital producer at CBS Los Angeles. She is a South Bay native and majored in print journalism at Cal State University Long Beach. Julie previously reported for the Beach Reporter, contributed to the Palos Verdes Pulse and worked as a video journalist for CBS News before joining the CBS News Los Angeles website team.\n\nAs the prolonged U.S. government shutdown is set to lead to the November 1 suspension of food stamp benefits, the Los Angeles Unified School District is ramping up efforts to provide meals to students.\n\nLAUSD Superintendent Alberto Carvalho said at a Thursday news conference that supper meals will be made available to district students ages 1 through 18 at most district schools.\n\n\"The rumbling stomach of a child will prevent that child from learning. It is not humane; it is not compassionate, we will not stand by it,\" Carvalho said.\n\nWith more than 1 \u00bd million SNAP recipients in LA County, 217,000 district students depend on those benefits, according to Carvalho.\n\nIn the LAUSD school system, free breakfast and lunch are already offered to any student, but now the district is to make supper available at \"most of our schools.\"\n\nA district website lists food resources available to families, and the hundreds of schools where supper will be provided Monday through Friday, no questions asked.\n\nThis week, the program kicks off with shelf-stable food products, and beginning next week, cooked food will be available.\n\nCarvalho also noted that the district website provides resources for food assistance to families.\n\n\"Political fights should never result in meals being removed from the table of our children,\" Carvalho said.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom said he would deploy National Guard troops to assist food bank operations and fast-track $80 million to keep the state's food banks stocked to ensure SNAP recipients have access to food.",

        "title": "Rep. Jasmine Crockett fact checked on CNN after repeating false Trump...",
        "description": "CNN anchor Kaitlan Collins corrected Rep. Jasmine Crockett (D-Texas) after the congresswoman repeated a debunked claim that President Donald Trump's top priority during the government shutdown is building the new White House ballroom.\n\nThe tense exchange unfolded Monday night on \"The Source\" as Crockett pivoted from a question about the shutdown to attack Trump's East Wing renovation plans.\n\n\"The president has time to do everything but what he needs to focus on,\" the lefty pol said.\n\n\"In fact, we heard the press secretary say his main priority is the ballroom -- the ballroom that no one asked for. The ballroom that requires him to destroy historic pieces of the White House.\"\n\nCollins quickly interrupted to clarify that Crockett's statement took the White House's earlier comments out of context.\n\n\"Yeah, and that context of the comment from Karoline Leavitt -- she was asked if the president was working on any other renovations when it came to the White House,\" the anchor said.\n\n\"And she was saying his focus was the ballroom.\"\n\nThe fact-check came after a week of confusion surrounding remarks by Leavitt, Trump's press secretary, which went viral when Acyn Torabi of the progressive outlet MeidasTouch shared them in a misleading tweet.\n\nAt an Oct. 23 White House briefing, Leavitt was asked whether the president was considering \"any other renovations or significant projects\" beyond the new ballroom and Rose Garden patio.\n\nShe replied: \"Not to my knowledge, no. But he's a builder at heart, clearly. And so his heart and his mind is always churning about how to improve things here on the White House grounds. But at this moment in time, of course, the ballroom is really the president's main priority.\"\n\nTorabi posted a shortened version of that exchange on X, writing only: \"Leavitt: At this moment in time, the ballroom is really the president's main priority.\"\n\nThe clip racked up more than 2 million views and drew outrage from Democratic lawmakers and left-leaning commentators who accused Trump of pursuing vanity projects while federal employees went unpaid.\n\n\"Good to know,\" California Gov. Gavin Newsom wrote in response.\n\n\"Honestly, you can't make this s-t up,\" said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY).\n\n\"Costs are exploding and people need relief,\" chimed in Rep. Marcy Kaptur (D-Ohio).\n\n\"If the President can take a break from knocking down the East Wing and ballroom planning, I'd love to show him our district where many of his supporters need his help.\"\n\nBut the post's framing was inaccurate, as Leavitt's full response made clear she was referring specifically to renovation work -- not the president's governing agenda.\n\nThe tweet nonetheless spread widely across social media and cable segments before being challenged by multiple outlets.\n\nThe ballroom project itself has become a lightning rod, drawing sharp criticism from Democrats who say it symbolizes misplaced priorities during a shutdown now approaching historic length.\n\nThe White House has said the expansion, with an estimated $300 million price tag, is being financed entirely by private donors.\n\nRep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) has called on all 2028 Democratic presidential hopefuls to \"tear down\" the ballroom if elected.\n\nCrockett's office has not commented on the CNN interview or whether she plans to correct her remarks. The Texas Democrat earlier told Collins she had \"no idea\" when the shutdown might end.",

        "description": "San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie speaks during a press conference at San Francisco City Hall on Oct. 23, 2025 in San Francisco, California.\n\nSan Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie, who was recently thrust into a national debate about the safety of big cities, told CNBC on Thursday that he feels \"pressure every day\" to continue improving conditions for residents.\n\nLast week, President Donald Trump reversed plans for a \"federal surge\" in San Francisco. The potential National Guard deployment hit the headlines when Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff told the New York Times that he'd support Trump's call for federal troops to be sent to the city.\n\nBenioff's sentiments were supported by Elon Musk and David Sacks, high-profile techies with close ties to the Trump administration. Benioff quickly backtracked as criticism mounted.\n\nUnlike California Governor Gavin Newsom, Lurie has tried to avoid clashing with Trump since taking office in January. But he has spoken up to say that the city is progressing on business development and crime, often citing data to back up his claims.\n\nIn Thursday's interview, Lurie's first on television since the Trump incident, the mayor said there's plenty of hard work ahead.\n\n\"I felt that pressure in January, I feel it today,\" Lurie said, when asked about support from tech leaders. \"I think they understand... when San Francisco is strong, America is strong.\"",

        "title": "Gov. Gavin Newsom Turns California Election Into Possible 2028 Platform",
        "description": "In Iowa, a retired math teacher clicked a link in a text message and donated $35. A school secretary in Las Vegas pitched in $50. An interior designer in Pennsylvania, an insurance agent in Chicago and a ski instructor in New Hampshire each gave $100.\n\nTheir small donations all went to California to help Gov. Gavin Newsom try to flip five congressional seats for Democrats.\n\n\"I'm so disenchanted with the direction of this country today that I have to support the people that are standing up for democracy,\" said Amy Kaufman, the ski instructor. \"And Gavin Newsom is one of them.\"\n\nResponding to email and text message appeals, small donors from across the country gave Mr. Newsom a combined $38 million for a ballot measure intended to stop President Trump and Republicans from retaining complete control of the federal government in 2026.\n\nNearly half of donors who cumulatively gave at least $100 came from outside of California. In multiple interviews, these donors said they gave to Mr. Newsom because they saw him as one of the few Democrats fighting Republicans on their own terms. After President Trump asked leaders in Texas and other red states to pursue rare, mid-decade gerrymandering to offset potential midterm losses for Republicans, California is the closest of any Democrat-led state to striking back so far.\n\nPolls suggest that California voters are very likely to pass Mr. Newsom's redistricting measure on Tuesday, a win that could serve as the ultimate foundation for a 2028 presidential run that he is considering. If he runs, he could tell voters that he directly fought back against Mr. Trump in the midterms.\n\nAnd he would emerge with a national list of donors and supporters that few other Democratic hopefuls have at the moment.\n\nThe list began more than 25 years ago, when Mr. Newsom was a wine entrepreneur just getting his footing as a politician. Mr. Newsom said in an interview that he started building an email list of donors when he was on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors and wanted to gather support for a bond measure to fund parks.\n\n\"I started going, 'Oh, emails, that's interesting and novel,\" he recalled. \"'I should use these.'\"\n\nFrom there, he took a methodical approach to building his list, gathering more names and emails every time he ran for another office or put an initiative on the ballot. The list includes names that Mr. Newsom has collected organically, as well as those in databases he has purchased.\n\nThe project accelerated in 2021 when Republicans tried to recall Mr. Newsom and he reached out to Democrats across the country for support. Then, in 2023, Mr. Newsom created a political action committee to support Democrats in Republican-controlled states -- giving him a reason to collect more names and emails from beyond California.\n\nBuilding the list had become a discipline. Mr. Newsom called the list \"huge\" but declined to say an exact number. He now calls the list \"the most valuable asset\" of his political career.\n\n\"It's a very deliberative investment,\" Mr. Newsom said. \"It's a lot of resources. It's a lot of time and a lot of iteration.\"\n\nAlong the way, Mr. Newsom picked up contact info for Steven Lamansky, a retired high school math teacher in Ankeny, Iowa, just north of Des Moines. Mr. Lamansky sent his first $35 donation to the Proposition 50 campaign on Aug. 10 after receiving a text message pitch from Mr. Newsom's campaign. Two weeks later, he sent another $35. The next month, $35 more.\n\nMr. Lamansky, 77, said he donated because he wanted to counter gerrymandering in Republican-led states and help Democrats to take back the House next year. But he also pitched in specifically to boost Mr. Newsom.\n\n\"I find him a very dynamic person,\" Mr. Lamansky said. \"Every time I've heard him on different shows, he's really got his ducks in a row. He knows his facts. I really like him, and I'd like to see him run for president.\"\n\nMr. Newsom has curated his national image, just as he has his supporter list. He has gone on Fox News to attack Republicans, including a face-off with Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida in 2023 that was billed as \"The Great Red vs. Blue State Debate.\" He started the podcast \"This Is Gavin Newsom\" this year, turning heads when he asked conservatives like Charlie Kirk and Steve Bannon why the Democrats failed in 2024.\n\nAfter Mr. Trump sent National Guard troops to Southern California in June during immigration raids and protests, Mr. Newsom returned to his place as a chief antagonist of the Republican president. One night, with troops in Los Angeles, he gave a speech on national television warning Americans that \"democracy is under assault right before our eyes.\"\n\nThis summer, Mr. Newsom used a more experimental communication strategy. With help from his young staff, Mr. Newsom adopted an aggressively satirical voice mocking Mr. Trump on social media. And he began appearing on platforms that cater to young, male audiences -- a cohort that Democrats lost ground with in last year's election.\n\nBetween banter about sports and video games, the governor has slipped in pleas for his redistricting measure into the \"All the Smoke\" podcast, which is hosted by two retired N.B.A. players, and a livestreamed game of Fortnite with a Twitch streamer known as ConnorEatsPants.\n\nRepublicans have struggled to counter Mr. Newsom on Proposition 50, in part because of the governor's fund-raising prowess, but also because he was so effective in making the race a referendum on Mr. Trump in a Democratic state. They lacked a central figure or message around which to build a groundswell of opposition.\n\nRepresentative Kevin Kiley, a California Republican who would become immediately vulnerable if Proposition 50 passes, has spent years challenging Mr. Newsom, including during the 2023 recall when he ran as a candidate for governor.\n\nMr. Kiley has been a lonely voice in Washington calling for a national prohibition on mid-decade redistricting. He said the ballot measure seemed to be serving as a \"launching pad\" for Mr. Newsom's 2028 aspirations.\n\n\"His entire governorship,\" Mr. Kiley said, \"he has treated as a warm-up to running for president.\"\n\nMr. Newsom's efforts have resonated with Democratic voters beyond California, as he has climbed to the top of several Democratic presidential primary polls in the months since he began the redistricting campaign.\n\nIt is, of course, too early to anoint any contender, let alone Mr. Newsom. The California governor could struggle in many states to overcome his reputation as a liberal coastal elite, an image that Democrats are desperately trying to shed at the moment.\n\nThough Mr. Newsom is getting a lot of traction with the Democratic activist base, it does not mean he will win a primary three years from now, said Mike Murphy, a former adviser to Republican presidential candidates who supported Joseph R. Biden Jr. in 2020 and Kamala Harris last year instead of Mr. Trump.\n\n\"He's got a flashy thing of the moment,\" Mr. Murphy said. \"In the 100 steps to the nomination, it doesn't hurt him. I just think you can overrate it.\"\n\nMatt Bennett, a Democratic strategist who worked on campaigns for former President Bill Clinton, said that Mr. Newsom may also have a hard time running a presidential campaign because of a perception nationally that California is a troubled state.\n\n\"What he can do is run on his aggressive efforts to take on Trump and MAGA in various ways,\" Mr. Bennett said, adding that the redistricting measure would be \"the most important and prominent of them.\"\n\nSteven Rich contributed data analysis, and Shane Goldmacher contributed reporting.",

        "description": "Vice President JD Vance spoke with reporters outside the White House Oct. 30, 2025, when he rallied just five Democrats come forward and vote in favor of re-opening the federal government.\n\nVice President JD Vance called on five \"reasonable Democrats\" to come forward and join Republicans and the three Democrats who have voted to reopen the government as the shutdown drags on and heightens travel woes within the aviation industry.\n\n\"All we need to end the craziness, to pay the air traffic controllers, to pay the (Transportation Security Administration) agents, to pay the pilots, to make sure that food stamp benefits continue to go out to the American people who need them,\" Vance said during a gaggle at the White House Thursday afternoon. \"All we need is five reasonable Democrats to join three moderate Democrats and 52 Republicans to reopen the government.\"\n\nVance held a roundtable at the White House Thursday afternoon with Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy, Airlines for America CEO and former New Hampshire Governor Chris Sununu, Teamsters chief Sean O'Brien and other aviation and related industry leaders.\n\nThe roundtable comes as staffing issues persist among air traffic controllers, with the issues worsening this week as air traffic controllers officially missed their first full paycheck Tuesday.\n\nFLIGHT DELAYS WORSEN AS UNPAID AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS FEEL GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN PAIN\n\nThe government shutdown has continued since Oct. 1, when Senate lawmakers failed to reach an agreement on a funding package. Republicans have pinned blame for the shutdown on Democrats for allegedly working to include healthcare benefits for illegal immigrants in the package, which Democrats have denied while arguing Republicans are to blame due to not negotiating healthcare demands.\n\nOnly two Senate Democrats, Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada and John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, as well as independent Angus King of Maine, who caucuses with the Democrats, have voted alongside 52 Republicans to reopen the government. The measure needs 60 votes in order to pass.\n\n\"I've been a little bit unfair, and I want to correct this, because when I say the Democrats have shut down the government, it's actually the far left side of the Democratic Party,\" Vance added. \"Because to their great credit, three moderate Democrats joined 52 Senate Republicans to vote to reopen the government. We need five more reasonable Democrats to put the American people first and reopen the government.\"\n\nSEAN DUFFY FIRES BACK AFTER GAVIN NEWSOM BLAMES TRUMP FOR SHUTDOWN, TRAVEL DELAYS\n\nBoth Duffy and Vance described the shutdown as a \"hostage\" situation as families suffer without paychecks, federal food benefits run dry, and air travel hangs in the balance as Americans prepare to travel for the holidays.\n\n\"We are happy to talk about any policy issues,\" Vance said. \"We're happy to talk about health care policy. We're happy to talk about tax policy. We're happy to talk about regulatory policy, but not at the point of a gun.\"\n\nVANCE BLAMES SCHUMER'S FEAR OF AOC PRIMARY CHALLENGE AS SHUTDOWN CAUSE\n\n\"You do not get to take the American people's government hostage and then demand that we give you everything you want in order to pay our air traffic controllers,\" he continued. \"It's a ridiculous set of demands. Let's reopen the government and then let's sit down and talk about how to compromise on policy for the American people.\"\n\nDuffy added: \"Don't hold air traffic controllers hostage.\"\n\n\"A lot of our people can go through the miss of one paycheck, and it's hard for them, but a lot of them can get through it. None of them can get through two paychecks. And so, again, if Democrats don't get their act together very quickly, you're going to see huge problems,\" Duffy said.\n\nThe shutdown already has caused delays at airports in cities such as Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas and Newark, New Jersey, as air traffic controllers, who are employed by the Federal Aviation Administration, cope with staffing shortages.\n\nUnions and trade associations related to airlines and airports increasingly have called on Senate lawmakers to pass a \"clean continuing resolution\" as the shutdown drags on, including the Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal Association, an independent union representing aircraft maintenance technicians and other related employees, on Wednesday.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"On behalf of the Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal Association (AMFA) and our 4,400 members in the Unites States representing the aircraft maintenance technicians at Alaska Airlines, Southwest Airlines, Horizon Air, Spirit Airlines, and Sun Country Airlines, we urge Congress to end the government shutdown by passing a clean Continuing Resolution,\" AMFA National President Bret Oestreich said in a press release published Wednesday.",

        "description": "California's richest residents could be slapped with a one-time 5% tax on their net worth if a new law makes it onto the ballot next year.\n\nThe measure - called the \"2026 Billionaire Tax Act\" - seeks to counter $30 billion in potential federal funding cuts to California's Medicaid program.\n\nCash from the new tax could also pay for the Golden State's struggling public education system, according to supporters of the act, which include the Service Employees International Union (SEIU).\n\nIf passed and signed off by Gov. Gavin Newsom, California's tech bosses like Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, could face huge tax bills.\n\nFive percent of Huang's estimated net worth could see him paying a one-time bill of over $8 billion, for example. Zuck's bill could be even higher, at around $12 billion or more.\n\nLiberal supporters argue that around 200 billionaires in California hold about $2 trillion in wealth, but the state's other 19 million taxpayers pay a \"much larger portion\" of their true income -- echoing policies of New York mayoral front-runner Zohran Mamdani.\n\n\"If we do not do this, millions of people are going to lose health care, an untold number of people will go without treatment and there will be tragedy after tragedy,\" Dave Regan, president of SEIU-United Healthcare Workers West, said in a statement, according to Newsweek.\n\nCalifornia's Attorney General's office received a request on Oct. 21 to allow supporters to begin collecting signatures to get it on the November 2026 ballot.\n\nThe measure would need to garner more than 870,000 signatures by next spring to make the ballot, Realtor.com reported.\n\nThe proposal also comes as the state continues to grapple with population losses to lower-tax states such as Florida and Texas.\n\nBetween 2023 and 2024, more Americans left California than any other state, Newsweek reported, citing Census Bureau data.\n\nThe SEIU did not immediately respond to The Post's request for comment.",

        "title": "Republicans fight Newsom's $88M redistricting 'power grab' as Prop 50 battle heats up",
        "description": "Former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger said Gov. Gavin Newsom's claim that his redistricting plan would be temporary \"total fantasy\" during a CNN interview.\n\nThe Congressional Leadership Fund (CLF), a key fundraising arm of House Republican leadership, has spent $13 million to stop the California redistricting measure led by the state's Democrat governor, Gavin Newsom, falling well short of the waves of cash in support of the measure.\n\nThat doesn't mean Republicans have given up hope that voters may still reject Proposition 50.\n\nRep. Vince Fong, R-Calif., is one of the many Republicans who could face steeper election odds in 2026 if voters approve the new congressional maps up for consideration.\n\n\"I appreciate CLF stepping up to help us fight back against Newsom and his progressive puppets who have made it their mission to strip voter protections from our state constitution,\" Fong said when asked whether $13 million would be enough to persuade voters.\n\nOBAMA ENDORSES NEWSOM CALIFORNIA REDISTRICTING PROP 50\n\n\"Fair representation is on the ballot. We continue to do everything we can to get out the vote and stop Newsom's power grab that will silence the voice of Californians,\" he said.\n\nVoters will consider Proposition 50 on Nov. 4.\n\nThe California Secretary of State's reporting on campaign finance reveals that the CLF has made three transfers since Newsom approved proposition 50 on Aug 21.\n\nCLF paid out $5 million on Sept. 5 in opposition messaging. The committee made two more donations: $5 million on Oct. 3 and another $3 million on Oct. 14 -- both to the California Republican Party.\n\n\"Congressional Leadership Fund spent $13 million in California to protect our members from a corrupt, power-hungry Democrat supermajority,\" CLF spokeswoman Torunn Sinclair said of those transfers. \"Californians should vote NO on Prop 50 because the last thing corrupt California Democrats need is even more power.\"\n\nNORTHERN CALIFORNIA VOTERS WEIGH IN ON PROP 50 REDISTRICTING FIGHT\n\nDespite the CLF's support, supporters of Proposition 50 have vastly outspent its opposition. According to the California Secretary of State, Newsom's \"Yes on 50\" fundraising vehicle has accumulated over $88 million on its own.\n\nNewsom has repeatedly framed his efforts as a necessary rebuttal to similar Republican-led redistricting efforts in Texas.\n\nIf successful, Proposition 50 would temporarily amend the California constitution, circumvent state prohibitions on gerrymandering and implement a new set of constituency maps that draw a red line through several Republican-held congressional districts.\n\nBy selectively spreading their districts to areas that have historically voted for Democrats, Proposition 50 aims to dilute Republican electoral power. Because of razor-thin margins in the House of Representatives, even one or two more seats for either party could decide the balance of power in the lower chamber of Congress and, by extension, in Washington, D.C.\n\nVOTING UNDERWAY IN 2025 ELECTION THAT MAY DETERMINE IF REPUBLICANS HOLD HOUSE IN 2026 MIDTERMS\n\nFindings by the Public Policy Institute of California show that a majority of voters say they would vote yes on Nov 4. In research released on Wednesday, the institute's polling shows that 56% of respondents said they would likely vote to support it compared with just 43% of voters who said they would likely vote no.\n\nDespite the high-stakes contest and a lopsided funding picture, a strategist familiar with the thinking of California Republicans believes that some nuances at play reduce the proposition's likelihood. They pointed out the measure itself may not be an automatic yes for many voters.\n\n\"With mail-in ballots, 'no' has a built-in advantage,\" the source said, noting that a wide range of California's voters use mail to participate in elections.\n\nThey explained that voters reading a description of the measure with only superficial understanding of what it does may fill out the \"no\" option if they're unsure about what to put down.\n\nThe source also pointed out that California also approved a constitutional amendment in place in 2008 that prohibited gerrymandering, noting that Californians who have voted for that measure might find themselves reluctant to undo their own votes now.\n\nThat's the case that Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., believes Republicans can make to voters in the closing days of the campaign. Like Fong, Isaa's district could also change with the adoption of Proposition 50.\n\n\"We've made a strong, consistent and statewide case that Prop. 50 is an unprecedented power grab that shouldn't pass the test of millions of voters who already chose to prevent just this kind of gerrymandering,\" Rep.

        "title": "Families worried about affording food while states stress about replacing SNAP funding",
        "description": "SNAP helps 41.7M Americans afford food, but a shutdown could halt benefits starting November 1.\n\nTaylour Grant is trying to keep her four kids from finding out there won't be money for food in a few days.\n\nThe 29-year-old former medical assistant in Tampa, Florida, hasn't been able to work since May because one of her children, who has autism, needed her full attention. So she doesn't have a cushion to replace the money she's gotten the first of every month through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), commonly known as food stamps.\n\n\"I try not to ... show what's happening on the forefront because of my kids, but I mean, ultimately, what? What can we do? It is out of our hands,\" said Grant, whose oldest is 14 and youngest, just 1. \"I haven't been working, things are getting behind. I'm already facing eviction. I have other bills piled up.\"\n\nWhen SNAP benefits don't arrive for Grant and 42 million other Americans on Nov. 1, it will be the first time that food safety net money has been delayed in the program's 60-year history.\n\n\"The tap has never been turned off even during a shutdown because everybody up until now, every administration, Republican or Democrat, has understood that feeding Americans is a fundamental responsibility of the federal government,\" Oregon State Treasurer Elizabeth Steiner told USA TODAY.\n\nBut on Oct. 27, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said it can't use the $6 billion in its contingency fund account to pay for SNAP, although the agency has used it in at least two previous shutdowns, including the 2018 to 2019 shutdown during President Donald Trump's first term, which lasted 35 days.\n\nTwo states told USA TODAY they cannot afford to provide the funds to fill the gap, others are trying even though the federal government says states are not allowed to. Several governors have declared states of emergency so surplus and emergency funds can be used to help food banks or SNAP recipients directly.\n\nRecipients and state officials are scrambling to figure out how to put food on the table with just a few days' notice. Grant is worried that food banks and civic organizations will be overwhelmed and quickly run out of food.\n\n\"There are 42 million people that are going to be missing out. And that's a number that is unheard of,\" Grant said. She is \"trying to figure out what churches are going to be giving out food and stuff like that, or what food banks are near, and just trying to look at every resource possible right now.\"\n\n'Suspending a lifeline'\n\nAround 12% of the more than 342 million people in the United States rely on the federal program, which provides low-income families with monthly benefits to afford healthy food.\n\nAccording to the USDA's fiscal year 2019 annual report of demographics of SNAP users, 36% of recipients were White, and 26% were Black. It also shows that 43% of participants were children, 32% were nondisabled, non-elderly adults, 16% of participants were age 60 or older, and 10% were non-elderly adults with disabilities.\n\n\"Suspending SNAP due to the shutdown is suspending a lifeline,\" Steiner, the Oregon state treasurer, said.\n\nIn fiscal year 2025, the average monthly benefit per person in the SNAP program was $190.59, according to the USDA. For households, the average monthly benefit was $356.41 in total.\n\nUSDA's announcement that benefits wouldn't be paid came as a surprise as Congress ambles into the second month of a government shutdown with no public signs of negotiations between the two parties.\n\nThe USDA has historically used contingency funds to ensure benefits were not interrupted during previous shutdowns, but now claims it cannot legally issue the money.\n\n\"Bottom line, the well has run dry. At this time, there will be no benefits issued November 1,\" the agency stated in a message on its website.\n\nThe USDA's shutdown contingency plan, which was issued in September to explain how the agency would function during a shutdown, said the agency has a reserve of contingency funds, which can be used to pay benefits directly. That plan has since been removed from the USDA's website.\n\nIn a letter shared with USA TODAY, the USDA said the contingency money is available only \"to supplement regular monthly benefits when amounts have been appropriated for, but are insufficient to cover, benefits.\"\n\n\"The contingency fund is not available to support (fiscal year) 2026 regular benefits, because the appropriation for regular benefits no longer exists,\" the letter said.\n\nCongressional leaders of both parties immediately placed responsibility on the shoulders of the other party. The White House sent USA TODAY an unattributable statement accusing Democrats of being happy to use SNAP recipients as political pawns.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana told reporters that he's received a summary of a legal analysis concluding that the SNAP contingency funds \"are not legally available to cover the benefits right now.\"\n\n\"I got a summary of the whole legal analysis and it certainly looks legitimate to me,\" he said.\n\nWhen asked for a copy of that legal analysis, USDA and the Speaker's office referred USA TODAY to a memo with no supporting legal citations.\n\nSenate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York said the government found ways to fund SNAP during all previous shutdowns, including the longest one. He called the argument that Trump can't provide the benefits during the funding lapse \"nasty, vicious, self-serving bull.\"\n\n\"Republicans are on a crusade to kill SNAP,\" Schumer said on the Senate floor on Oct. 29.\n\nSome states find a way forward\n\nAttorneys general and governors from 25 Democrat-led states filed a lawsuit in federal court in Boston on Oct. 28 in an attempt to force the Trump administration to fund the nation's largest food aid program.\n\nThe lawsuit argues that suspending SNAP benefits is avoidable, arbitrary and is being carried out in violation of the Food and Nutrition Act, which requires that \"assistance under this program shall be furnished to all eligible households.\"\n\nColorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Louisiana, Minnesota, New Mexico, Vermont and Virginia and other states have announced that they plan to supplement SNAP funding in some capacity or use state money to purchase food for food banks.\n\nThe program is fully federally funded, and the USDA has said states will not be refunded if they choose to help SNAP recipients.\n\nMany states are pointing residents to food banks and asking others to donate what they can.\n\nRepublican Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin announced on Oct. 28 a plan to give state-funded benefits to Virginians who are already on SNAP once federal benefits lapse on Nov. 1.\n\nThe Virginia Emergency Nutrition Assistance will deposit weekly benefits starting on Nov. 3 to EBT cards for Virginians who received SNAP benefits for October, he said at a news conference.\n\nUsing funds from the state surplus, the Virginia program is expected to total roughly $37.5 million every week.\n\n\"We are prepared to run this program for the entire month of November,\" Youngkin told reporters.\n\nIn New York, Gov. Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, announced Oct. 30 that she was declaring a state of emergency to issue $65 million for food assistance. The governors of Delaware, Louisiana and Rhode Island have also declared states of emergency to move money faster.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, deployed the state's National Guard troops and a state office that organizes volunteer efforts to support food banks by helping to prepare food for distribution. Newsom is also \"fast-tracking\" about $80 million worth of state support to food banks, according to a news release.\n\nBut not all can fill the gap\n\nStill, leaders of multiple states stressed that what they can do is not enough to fill the gap between what food banks can provide and the hundreds of millions of monthly SNAP meals.\n\nMassachusetts State Treasurer Deborah Goldberg said her state isn't prepared to cover the $225 million for food residents would have received in November.\n\n\"We are facing a real moment of deep concern for millions and upon millions of American families. This irresponsible, aggressive attempt to shut down food assistance puts 42 million people at risk,\" Goldberg said. \"In this country, there should not be a food emergency, and certainly no one in government should be depriving people of an essential such as food.\"\n\nThe governor and other elected officials are discussing pulling the money from Massachusetts' emergency fund to help with SNAP, but have to balance that decision with the $2.7 billion in revenue it will lose because of the GOP tax and spending bill signed into law this summer, Goldberg said.\n\n\"SNAP is one of the emergencies we have and we have many right now caused by the actions of the federal government, including health care costs,\" she said.\n\nIn Oregon, one month of missed federal payments is approximately $140 million and \"we do not have the state resources to backfill these suspended federal payments,\" said Steiner, the state treasurer.\n\nSteiner said it is immoral to use hunger as a leveraging tool to reopen the government.\n\n\"State budgets cannot replace vital federally funded programs like SNAP, even as these cold-hearted decisions leave families hungry,\" she said. \"This decision on behalf of the federal government is an absolute abdication of its responsibility to families in Oregon and across the United States who are struggling to make ends meet.\"\n\nOregon and Massachusetts are considered \"blue\" states, with Democrats serving in most of their elected leadership roles. But states that will be hardest hit by the SNAP funding loss include \"red\" states like Texas and Louisiana.\n\nIt's not a lot of money, but it helps\n\nJanice Waite, 52, of Pembroke Pines, Florida, still has three of her four sons living at home, one of whom is autistic, nonverbal and has seizures. She has to work around his schedule and has a hard time working a 9-5 job.\n\nShe recently reapplied for SNAP after previously using it for years and is waiting to hear the status of her application.\n\nHer parents and sister have been helping out and she uses the food bank at her children's school. With three teenage boys in the house, she was counting on the SNAP funds in November.\n\n\"It's not a lot of money, but it's still a huge help,\" she said. \"We're all praying that they come up with some sort of a better plan because we can't afford it.\"\n\nUSA TODAY reporters Bart Jansen, Rebecca Morin and Melina Khan contributed to this article.\n\nSarah D.

        "title": "How States Are Preparing for a Freeze in Federal Food Assistance",
        "description": "The Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program will run out of money on Saturday. Some governors are shifting state money to cover part of the shortfall, bolster food pantries or both.\n\nWith the federal government shut down and the Trump administration refusing to tap reserve funds, 42 million low-income Americans are expected to lose access on Nov. 1 to food assistance through the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program, or SNAP.\n\nMore than two dozen states led by Democratic governors and attorneys general have sued the administration, saying the cutoff of funding to the program, which provides around $187 a month to about one out of every eight people in the United States, is unnecessary and illegal.\n\nThe states have asked a federal judge to force the Agriculture Department to use billions of dollars in federal emergency funds to provide at least partial payments to enrollees in the program. Whether that happens remains to be seen.\n\nHere are some of the ways that states have been preparing for looming SNAP shutdown:\n\nEmergency funds\n\nMore than a dozen states -- most of them run by Democrats -- will be using their own funds to temporarily fill the gap, primarily by working with food banks.\n\nCalifornia is releasing $80 million to bolster food banks in the state. Connecticut is allocating $3 million for that purpose, and Minnesota $4 million. .\n\nOn Thursday, Illinois set aside $20 million -- $10 million from a new emergency reserve fund and $10 million from the state's Department of Human Services -- for seven food banks.\n\nIn Hawaii, Gov. Josh Green, a Democrat, is diverting a $100 million surplus from the federal Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program to help families with children pay their housing and utility bills, freeing up money in the family budget to be spent on food instead. About one-third of Hawaiians who receive SNAP benefits are in families with children.\n\nAnd in Vermont, the state's Republican governor, Phil Scott, and the Democratic-controlled legislature announced on Wednesday that the state would spend $6.3 million to fully fund SNAP benefits for two weeks. The state also approved sending $250,000 to the Vermont Foodbank.\n\nMissouri, a Republican-run state, is using a targeted approach. On Wednesday, Gov. Mike Kehoe authorized shifting $10.6 million from a senior services fund to a statewide network of nonprofit groups that would provide meals to seniors. Mr. Kehoe has also set aside $5 million in federal welfare funds for food banks.\n\nSome governors, however, have pointedly said that they won't use state funds to replace missing federal food aid, at a time when states are contending with a slowing economy, sweeping federal spending cuts and swirling uncertainties stemming from the president's trade and immigration policies.\n\nGov. Wes Moore of Maryland, a Democrat, stressed that SNAP was a federal program, and said that his state did not have the capacity to cover its cost. He also expressed doubt that his state would ever be reimbursed if it were to try.\n\nEmergency declarations\n\nOn Thursday, Gov. Kathy Hochul of New York became the latest state chief executive to declare a state of emergency as a mechanism to unlock more money for food assistance. Her commitment of $65 million means that the state has now authorized a total of $106 million in new funding for food banks and meal programs.\n\nTrump Administration: Live Updates\n\nUpdated\n\nOct. 30, 2025, 12:00 p.m. ET31 minutes ago\n\nGov. Glenn Youngkin of Virginia, a Republican, set the pace last week with his emergency declaration over SNAP funding, and said the state would use some of its budget surplus to create a new program, Virginia Emergency Nutrition Assistance, at a cost of $37.5 million a week.\n\nGov. Daniel McKee of Rhode Island, a Democrat, declared a state of emergency on Tuesday as a way of shifting $6 million from Temporary Assistance for Needy Families to families with children that are eligible for food stamps. Another $200,000 would go to the Rhode Island Community Food Bank.\n\nIn New Mexico, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, a Democrat, told reporters at an Albuquerque supermarket on Wednesday that her state would take similar steps.\n\nAbout 460,000 New Mexicans -- about 21 percent of the population, the highest rate in the country -- have been receiving SNAP benefits. The state plans to load a total of $30 million in state health funds -- which are separate from SNAP -- onto SNAP recipients' Electronic Benefits Transfer cards. That would mean that each recipient would be expected to receive about 30 percent of their usual food benefit in November.\n\nLouisiana took a slightly different approach. First, Gov. Jeff Landry, a Republican, declared a state of emergency on Oct. 24.\n\nThen on Wednesday, Mr. Landry said that the state would use $147 million from its health department's funds to pay for temporary food benefits in November for children, older residents and people with disabilities. Louisiana legislators expect the federal government to replenish the health funds when the shutdown ends -- though that's not guaranteed.\n\nIn Nevada, Gov. Joe Lombardo, a Republican, has authorized sending $38.8 million in state funds to food banks. But he has declined to declare a fiscal emergency, a step that would enable the state to access a reserve fund. Democratic legislators, who control both chambers of the state Legislature, have criticized his unwillingness to tap the reserve fund.\n\nGov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders of Arkansas, a Republican, said in an interview that her state would not be able either to set up a substitute food aid program or to call lawmakers in for a special session on the matter.\n\n\"Logistically, setting up a parallel food stamp program will be really difficult, given that the federal system is shut down,\" she said. Even so, she said, \"we'll continue to look at every option we have to take care of people in our state.\"\n\nGuard Deployments\n\nSome governors are dispatching National Guard troops or state volunteers to support distribution at food banks, which are expected to be overwhelmed with demand.\n\nIn California, Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, has authorized the National Guard and California Volunteers, the state's humanitarian aid agency, to support food banks, much the way they did during the height of the pandemic. About 30 National Guard troops were on hand at the Los Angeles Regional Food Bank last week to help pack meals and sort produce.\n\nGov. Henry McMaster of South Carolina, a Republican, has asked the State Guard, a volunteer organization that is separate from the South Carolina National Guard, to help food pantries with distribution, traffic and other functions.\n\nPrivate appeals\n\nSouth Carolina is also one of a number of states that are encouraging more private donations to food banks. Mr. McMaster has activated the One SC Fund, which functions as South Carolina's coordinated philanthropic response to disasters. It was established in 2015 after Hurricane Joaquin, and has been activated following Hurricanes Matthew, Florence, and Helene, as well as the pandemic.\n\nColorado has launched a new philanthropic initiative urging individuals and businesses to help with food assistance through Feeding Colorado, an association of five food banks in the state. The state has posted an interactive map to highlight where SNAP recipients live.\n\nGov. Jared Polis, a Democrat, has also asked the legislature to approve spending up to $10 million to support food pantries.\n\nEmily Cochrane and Eduardo Medina contributed reporting.",

        "description": "Barstow, a city in Southern California's Mojave Desert, is planning extra police patrols at grocery stores to deter theft as the food stamp aid program is set to run out of funding on Nov. 1.\n\nThe impending suspension of food aid comes as the federal government shutdown inches toward a month, making it the second-longest funding lapse in U.S. history. The U.S. Department of Agriculture, which runs the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, warned earlier this month that there would be insufficient funding to pay full November benefits if the shutdown continued.\n\nAbout 42 million Americans rely on food stamps, including 5.5 million in California. A little more than 23% of Barstow's population lives below the poverty line, above the state average of 17.7% and nearly double the national average of 12.4%\n\n\"We understand that these circumstances may cause additional stress for many families,\" the Barstow Police Department posted on Facebook. To help ensure the safety of residents, customers, and business owners, officers will be conducting extra patrols around local grocery stores, convenience stores, and shopping centers.\"\n\nBarstow PD said the move is \"a preventative measure to maintain public safety, deter theft, and reassure the community that law enforcement is present and ready to help.\"\n\nLast week, California Gov. Gavin Newsom deployed the state's National Guard to help staff food banks, which are preparing for a surge in demand similar to pandemic levels.\n\n\"We're really worried about kind of the overall demand and need,\" said Michael Flood, President and CEO of the Los Angeles Regional Food Bank. \"We're also going to be working on what we did during the pandemic, organizing larger distributions. Often, these are drive-thru distributions where we can serve thousands of households within a few hours.\"\n\nThere were signs of progress on ending the government shutdown for the first time in weeks on Wednesday, with senators expressing cautious optimism about bipartisan talks aimed at resolving the impasse. Half of the states, including California, sued the Trump administration over the suspension of food stamp benefits, in hopes that a federal judge will order the USDA to use contingency funds to ensure SNAP continues.\n\n\"We didn't think we'd be here,\" Flood said. \"Our hope is that there is a resolution back in DC. This is something that doesn't have to happen.\"",

        "title": "Trump ramps up involvement in this year's elections in possible preview of midterms pressure",
        "description": "DENVER (AP) -- After months of extraordinary steps to ensure his party maintains control of the U.S. House of Representatives in next year's midterms, President Donald Trump is turning his sights toward the voting process in next week's elections.\n\nThat pivot is raising alarm among Democrats and others who warn that he may be testing strategies his administration could use to interfere with elections in 2026 and beyond.\n\nLate last week, Trump's Department of Justice announced it was sending election monitors to observe voting in one county in New Jersey, which features a race for governor that Trump has become deeply invested in, and to five counties in California, where Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom is pushing a ballot measure to counter the president's own effort to rejigger the congressional map to elect more Republicans.\n\nThat announcement was followed with a pre-emptive attack by Trump on the legitimacy of California's elections. The post on his own social media platform echoed the baseless allegations he made about the 2020 presidential election before he and his allies tried to overturn his loss in a campaign that culminated in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.\n\n\"Watch how totally dishonest the California Prop Vote is!\" Trump wrote last weekend on Truth Social, referring to Proposition 50, the lone issue on the state's special election ballot. \"Millions of Ballots being 'shipped.'\"\n\nThe combination has prompted responses from several prominent Democrats, who were already bracing for Trump to use his presidential powers to tilt next year's midterms to his side.\n\n\"It's a bridge they're trying to build the scaffolding for, all across this country, in next November's elections,\" Newsom said in a video in which he also predicted the administration will send masked immigration agents to polling stations next week.\n\nDuring early voting so far, there has been no indication that troops or federal officers have shown up near polling sites or ballot drop boxes in any state. Despite the warnings from some Democrats, millions of voters already have cast ballots through early in-person or mail voting, a process that has produced no significant problems.\n\nTrump has long accused the Biden administration of trying to interfere in last year's presidential election after the Justice Department filed federal charges against him related to his attempts to overturn the 2020 results and his retention of classified documents after leaving office.\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson, using the president's favorite derogatory nickname for California's governor, said in a statement on Wednesday: \"Newscum ought to stop fearmongering to score political points with the radical left flank of the Democrat party that he is courting ahead of his doomed-to-fail presidential campaign.\"\n\nTuesday's elections are purely state-based, with no federal offices on the ballot. Trump has no ability to change the outcome in any way, experts said.\n\n\"Voters who go to vote in the 2025 election are going to find a very safe and secure process,\" said David Becker, a former Department of Justice voting rights attorney who now runs the Center for Election Innovation & Research. \"For example, I'm 100% confident that whoever wins the statewide elections in Virginia and New Jersey, regardless of what the president says, will take office.\"\n\nThe relatively low-profile off-year elections are headlined by the races for governor in New Jersey and Virginia, California's redistricting question and the mayor's race in New York City.\n\nTwo of the states where voting already is underway are considering measures that have major implications for next year's midterms.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, voters will decide whether three Democratic justices keep their seats on the state's supreme court. If they're removed, the court will have a 2-2 ideological split and potentially be unable to resolve disputes over voting and election procedures next year in the critical swing state.\n\nIn California, voters will decide whether to temporarily override an independent redistricting process and allow the Democratic-controlled Legislature to redraw the state's congressional districts. If voters pass the measure, it could create five new seats Democrats could win to counter Trump's push for Texas and other Republican-led states to redraw their districts and increase the number of winnable Republican House seats.\n\nThat's one reason the administration's decision to send monitors drew so much attention. It's not unusual for the federal government to send monitors to observe voting and ballot counting in certain areas, but it's typically done in consultation with local jurisdictions. That did not happen this time.\n\nInstead, the Trump administration announced the monitors solely in response to requests from local Republican parties.\n\nFederal monitors are only allowed to observe, are prohibited from talking to voters or even poll workers, and have no way to influence the counting of votes, said Becker, who has served as a monitor and also trained them.\n\n\"I don't think voters are ever going to notice or see any of these people,\" he said.\n\nStill, the Democratic attorneys general in California and New Jersey raised alarms, with New Jersey's Matt Platkin calling it \"highly inappropriate\" and California's Rob Bonta saying the move is especially concerning given Trump's record.\n\n\"These are not normal times,\" Bonta said in a call with reporters this week. \"We have to look at the broader context here about what the Trump administration is saying and what they are doing.\"\n\nThe action follows a monthslong campaign by Trump to use the powers of his office to boost his party's political prospects ahead of the midterms, where the incumbent party traditionally loses seats in Congress. The president has pushed states where Republicans control the redistricting process to redraw their boundaries to create more conservative-friendly seats. He also has directed his administration to investigate Democratic politicians, fundraisersand donors.\n\nNewsom and his Illinois counterpart, Gov. JB Pritzker, have warned that Trump's attempts to send the U.S. military into their states' most populous cities -- Los Angeles and Chicago -- are precursors to deploying the military or federal agents to polling places in Democratic-leaning cities next year.\n\nThey and other Democrats also have alluded to how some Trump allies in 2020 used manufactured claims of election fraud to propose using the military to seize voting machines.\n\nAt the same time, the Justice Department is demanding detailed voter data from the states and Trump issued an executive order trying to reshape how elections are run, which has been largely halted by the courts because the Constitution gives that power to the states, and, in some cases, Congress. It spells out no role for the president in setting election rules.\n\nUntil fairly recently, Trump had been relatively quiet about the 2025 elections, mostly taking steps that other presidents have made in election years, such as supporting his party's nominees in key races.\n\nHannah Fried, executive director of the voting rights group All Voting is Local, said the Nov. 4 election will provide \"an important set of data points\" about issues that could crop up in future elections, especially next year.\n\n\"That's the big dog,\" Fried said of the midterms. \"Everybody in the country's going to be voting in 2026. This is about control of Congress. As a country, we all have a stake in that.\"",

        "title": "Why Journalism Needs Literature",
        "description": "A few days ago, my imagination converged in a disturbing way with Donald Trump's. After the president posted an AI-generated video of himself piloting a fighter plane and releasing a flood of excrement onto thousands of demonstrators below, I heard from several people who had read my new novel, The Emergency, which will be published next month. They pointed out the resemblance of the video to a scene, near the novel's end, in which human feces become a primitive weapon of civil war. Somewhere down in the dark, well below conscious thought, I had managed to intuit just how far the demonic urge in American politics to violate every taboo might go. Or perhaps the White House had gotten hold of an Advance Reader's Copy.\n\nThe uncanny meld between my mind and Trump's was a little sickening. It was as if this master conjurer had pulled a trick on me, saying: I'll always beat you. I can always go lower. Back in the early '60s -- a time we now think of as relatively sane -- Philip Roth observed: \"You can't write good satirical fiction in America because reality will quickly outdo anything you might invent.\" But I wasn't trying to compete with reality. I didn't write a novel to mirror or predict the course of American politics -- if anything, the opposite. I wanted to get away from reality.\n\nFor a quarter century, I've been a journalist, and to be honest, I had begun to lose faith in my trade. The year 2021 marked a turning point in the history of facts: from poor health to near death. The insurrection of January 6 happened before our eyes and produced about three news cycles of almost universal horror before that consensus began to succumb to the assault of partisan revisions and elisions, lies, alternative facts, and conspiracy theories that dominate our media and pollute our minds. Sophisticates argue that there's never been any agreement about reality, that news in the age of Walter Cronkite was simply the dominant \"narrative\" put forth by the three major television networks and establishment papers. It's true that important facts have always been contested -- but in August 1974, when the \"smoking gun\" tape revealed Richard Nixon's central role in the Watergate cover-up, Republican politicians and conservative editorialists didn't claim that the tape was a fake or the product of an opposition conspiracy. Instead, they told Nixon to resign. That elusive thing called reality brought down a president.\n\nToday, with millions of social-media accounts and thousands of podcasts and channels to choose from, more than a third of Americans believe that the 2020 election was stolen from Trump, and a quarter believe that the pro-Trump marauders of January 6 were victims of an FBI trap. Many more Americans don't seem to care much about the truth of what happened that day, and the president who inspired the mob to invade the Capitol is back in power.\n\nThe Trump era poses numerous threats to the free press: constant abuse, denial of access, intimidation by regulatory or legal means, criminal investigation. But the greatest threat, aided by this forever war on reality, is irrelevance. \"Legacy media\" has become an insult, but its fall from authority is an epistemic catastrophe. Most of the public has no idea how much effort and money newsgathering requires, how many rounds of reporting, editing, and fact-checking a story goes through before it reaches the public and drowns in the new media \"ecosystem.\" Serious journalism in America today is a little like the independent English-language papers in certain authoritarian countries that are allowed to go on publishing because they're read by only a handful of elites and have no effect on the broader society. It's not just that changing readers' minds on important questions by presenting them with arguments and evidence has come to seem quixotic. Journalism can't even establish what's true, let alone what people should think about what's true.\n\nNancy A. Youssef: The last days of the Pentagon press corps\n\nWhy do journalists keep at it? In most cases, not because they imagine that their reporting will strike a blow for justice or hold the powerful to account (the powerful are pretty much unbound), but because they still believe that facts matter; because it's important to set down what's going on in the world, for posterity if not the present; because they love the craft; because it's what they do. But any honest journalist knows that this persistence has more in common with Camus than Cronkite. It's a Sisyphean act of faith.\n\nSo in late 2021 or early 2022, around the time truth disappeared, I started to think about writing a novel.\n\nAmong the alternatives to journalism, fiction was not an obvious choice. I'd published two novels in the 1990s and, as the philosopher David Hume said of one of his books, they \"fell dead-born from the press.\" Trying again a quarter-century older seemed like bad odds. For one thing, did anyone still read fiction? I mean literary fiction, the kind that aspires to complex characters, subtle themes, and careful attention to prose style. Those novels are gone from the best-seller lists -- it's all sexy dragons now. The novel ceased long ago to occupy the cultural center, giving way first to movies, then TV series, video games, social-media posts, and AI content. The novelist as voice of a generation no longer exists. Literary fiction has become more like classical music -- the eccentric taste of a diminishing set of the devoted. A book group that reads classic novels (I've been in one since the start of the Trump era) has the air of a circle of medieval monks solemnly bent over illuminated manuscripts, studying and preserving them through dark times until some future century rediscovers the literature of the past.\n\nAmerican fiction fell victim to the clamor of events. Starting around the 9/11 attacks, we began to live in a world of shocks, each one of them big enough to pull you out of the immersive state that writing or reading a novel requires. One benefit of this turn to the outer world of facts was a brief golden age of nonfiction books and articles -- writing that aspired to the literary quality of the best fiction while informing readers about politics and war and poverty. People who once regularly read novels and stories began to abandon them for book-length journalism, memoirs, biographies, magazines, newspapers, and websites. Imagination began to seem a pallid substitute for reality. The meaning of a story shrank if it didn't really happen.\n\nThis intense interest in the news of the world waned with the construction of the Tower of Babel that is the smartphone. People acquired the ability to absorb each shock of reality, each new mental stimulus, every second, anywhere. When, in 2018, Jonathan Franzen remarked, \"It's doubtful that anyone with an internet connection at his workplace is writing good fiction,\" he was criticized for being a highbrow snob, but he was onto something -- and it's true of reading fiction as well. You can flit back and forth between a nonfiction book and social media (though you'll lose a lot), but the willing suspension of disbelief does not survive frequent interruption. Works of the imagination need unbroken attention. Mine has gotten worse; don't tell me yours hasn't.\n\nFrom the January/February 2024 Issue: Is journalism ready?\n\nBy now we've moved beyond a post-literature culture into what some are calling a post-literate age, taking us back several thousand years to communication by images and symbols. Over the past two decades, the number of Americans who read for pleasure on a daily basis has dropped from 28 percent to 16 percent, and the trend among children and teenagers is even worse. In 2023 almost half of Americans didn't finish a single book. Surveys show that a big loser is fiction. Perhaps this plague of illiteracy has played a role in the disappearance of truth and, with it, liberal democracy.\n\nSo why write a novel now? In my case, because it's the literary form I know best and love most. I wanted to be a novelist from around the age of 14. Back in high-school English class in the late '70s, nonfiction was never assigned -- it wasn't considered literature. I never heard of Hiroshima or The Fire Next Time; as far as I knew, the only way to be a prose writer was to be a novelist. This misguided notion kept me pounding away at failure until well into my 30s, when I finally accepted that fiction was not my strong suit.\n\nI gave it up for journalism, and soon discovered that nonfiction could offer many of fiction's narrative pleasures -- scenes, characters, intricate structures, suspense, revelation. Dickens proved at least as useful to my job as the Human Rights Watch annual report. While writing a magazine article, and especially while writing a book, in my free time I tried to read only novels. I wanted to rid my head of the deadening language of politics and foreign policy in which I was immersed, and replace it with the sound of fiction. For a couple of my nonfiction books I even tried to base the voice and structure on a specific novel. But faith in a project always came from the solid material of interviews, research, experience -- facts. Until it no longer did.\n\nI didn't turn to fiction for a complete escape from reality. I never cared for sci-fi, fantasy, or magical realism. Nor am I capable of producing a novel with finely wrought observations of daily life. Writing doesn't pour out of me in an overflow of imagination, which is why those earlier efforts at fiction were not triumphs. Aside from sheer narcissism (always there, shoving me along), the main impulse that makes me sit down to write is political. A quarter century of journalism taught me that the sentences come out better when I feel strongly about the human rights and wrongs. The American situation is overwhelming, and I couldn't force myself to push it out of my mind long enough to write a novel about something else entirely. But a roman \u00e0 clef with stand-ins for Gavin Newsom and Steve Bannon was even less attractive than updating The Lord of the Rings for the digital age. I was dead tired of Trump's name; I felt no burning desire to fictionalize gerrymandering or pageviews; the words polarization and meme made my brain go numb.\n\nDan Rather and Elliot Kirschner: Why a free press matters\n\nI wanted to get as far as possible from these exhausted particulars in order to explore their deeper reality. I wanted to evoke the feeling of being alive right now: the fragility of truth, the ideological pressures, the hatred among groups, the fractures within families, the radical idea that humanity itself might be ending. And I wanted to see every side of this drama. The Emergency is a political novel: A long-established society undergoes a collapse and upheaval in which extreme ideas take hold, dividing generations and classes and leading to violence. But I wrote it as a fable, set in an unnamed place and time, the more remote and weird, the better. You won't encounter his name anywhere -- it's inconceivable.\n\nNow that the novel is finished, there's no barrier left between me and the facts. This excursion into fiction has begun to restore my appetite for them. Building a world that doesn't exist and exploring it for a couple of years made the one in which I actually live more alive and urgent than the familiar facts had made it seem. And Trump is still there. His lower mind just erupted in imagery that seems to have sprung from my own darkest intimation. Fiction does that, if we let it, if we keep it. You wake up from a long and vivid dream to find that the world is clearer, closer.",

        "title": "How Newsom has capitalized on anger with Trump in California ballot fight",
        "description": "California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) has made President Donald Trump the chief adversary in efforts to pass a redistricting plan in his state. (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)\n\nLOS ANGELES -- When a pair of Democratic door knockers asked Reid Pelsue on a recent Saturday whether he was familiar with an upcoming high-stakes special election, he told them he had no idea what they were talking about.\n\nBut when they said they were pushing a ballot measure to fight what they called President Donald Trump's \"power grab,\" by enabling Democrats to redraw the state's congressional map and add as many as five more seats to offset what Republicans were doing outside California, he was sold.\n\n\"It just hurts,\" Pelsue, 23, said of Trump's second term, citing the administration's immigration crackdown and voicing concern about the president's mid-decade redistricting push. Shooing his cats back inside, Pelsue went to grab his phone so the organizers could guide him to a website where he could request a ballot and find polling locations.\n\nAs California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) and his allies try to nudge their plan across the finish line in Tuesday's election, they are focusing squarely on Trump, running television commercials, digital ads and an aggressive canvassing operation that holds up the president as their chief adversary. Their bet, placed months ago before they had even launched the campaign, is that anger with Trump in a deep-blue state will motivate people to vote yes on Proposition 50 and simplify an appeal some initially worried could become muddled in the arcana of redistricting.\n\nThe strategy appears to be paying dividends as the campaign nears its conclusion, fueling a stark fundraising advantage and edge in the polls that Democrats hope will help deliver a concrete rebuttal to Trump's political agenda less than a year into his second term. Proponents of Prop 50, which include of a constellation of committees led by one Newsom is helming, outraised the opposing side by a wide margin through Oct. 18, campaign finance data show. At a critical juncture earlier this month when many voters had received their mailed ballots, two of the main committees urging Californians to vote no went dark on broadcast and satellite television, according to data from AdImpact, the latest indicator of an opposition campaign that has sputtered.\n\nThe fundraising imbalance had tipped so far in favor of advocates of the ballot measure this week that Newsom sent a fundraising message Monday telling supporters they could \"stop donating.\" \"We have hit our budget goals and raised what we need in order to pass Proposition 50,\" the Democratic governor wrote. \"Now it's about executing the plan. If we can do that, we're going to win.\" (On Tuesday, Newsom sent out a fundraising solicitation asking for $3 to fight GOP redistricting moves in Indiana).\n\nThe election in California, one of several states casting ballots on Nov. 4, will provide a measure of the potency of Democrats' frequently used anti-Trump message in a setting where it has not been tested: An off-year election in the country's most populous state, with no candidates on the ballot. While Newsom and his allies are sounding confident notes, observers cautioned that since the election is unlike most others in recent memory, a surprise outcome is possible.\n\nA Public Policy Institute of California poll showed that 56 percent of likely California voters said they will vote yes on Prop 50, while 43 percent said they will vote no. A CBS News survey showed a 62 percent to 38 percent spread.\n\nNewsom and his allies released a closing ad this week that tells viewers they can \"stand up to Donald Trump.\" It features former president Barack Obama and other prominent Democrats, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-New York).\n\nTrump has avoided getting directly or publicly involved in campaign activities involving the California ballot measure. But he recently sought, without evidence, to discredit the vote in a Truth Social post. Trump has also repeatedly insulted Newsom's competence as governor. Newsom has trolled the president with mocking posts on his own social media. The White House did not respond to a request for comment for this story.\n\nNewsom, who initially tried to collaborate with Trump after he was elected, pivoted to a sharply adversarial posture after Trump sent military troops into Los Angeles this summer in the midst of immigration protests -- before making Trump his chief foil in the redistricting campaign.\n\n\"Fear and anger are very powerful forces in politics -- and it's the Democrats that are fearful and angry,\" said California Republican strategist Kevin Spillane.\n\nCalifornia Democrats have pointed frequently to the outsize impact of Trump's tactics on their state -- from his administration's immigration raids, to his deployment of federal troops in Los Angeles, to the slashing of key education and research grants for California institutions. Underpinning those figures are the low approval ratings for Trump and his actions in California. The PPIC poll showed that just 26 percent of Californians approve of the way Trump is handling his job. Large majorities of Californians disapprove of the job that Immigration and Customs Enforcement is doing (71 percent) and the tariffs the U.S. has placed on imports (72 percent).\n\nOpponents of Newsom's plan have used an array of tactics aimed at different parts of the electorate, ranging from ads suggesting it would destroy the state's independent redistricting process to events where they have argued the new maps would break up Asian American communities and dilute the power of rural constituencies. In one ad, they also featured comments from former California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger (R) arguing for keeping the independent redistricting system he helped create and stating that Prop 50 would \"take us backwards.\" Privately, many Republicans in the state have been critical of what they viewed as a scattered unfocused message from the \"no\" side.\n\nJessica Millan Patterson, the chair of No on 50 -- Stop Sacramento's Power Grab, one of the committees opposing Newsom's ballot measure, said in a recent interview that her group believes the vote will be close and credited Trump's team for helping with turnout efforts. She argued that their message that \"the power is being taken away from the people\" with Newsom's ballot measure resonates with many independent voters. The committee is backed by former House speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-California).\n\n\"We always knew this was going to be an uphill battle for us,\" she said. \"We are making sure that we are targeting specific individuals that are persuadable in these last few days.\"\n\nThe Congressonal Leadership Fund, which is aligned with House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-Louisiana), gave money to the committee as well as the state GOP, while Charles Munger Jr. -- the Stanford physicist and Berkshire Hathaway heir who helped finance the original ballot measures creating the state's independent process -- funded a different committee opposing the measure with nearly $33 million.\n\nBut some of the money that opponents of the measure hoped would materialize has not arrived -- all while the opposition has raised money at a brisk pace. Newsom's ballot committee raised $114 million through the period ending on Oct. 18, while the McCarthy-aligned No on Prop 50 -- Stop Sacramento's Power Grab and the Munger-aligned No on Prop 50 -- Protect Voters First, raised $43.7 million over that same period.\n\n\"While we are being significantly outspent, there are still millions of votes to be submitted, and the campaign will focus on communicating to persuadable voters and turning out supporters,\" said Amy Thoma Tan, a spokeswoman for the Munger-aligned committee who declined to discuss the campaign's fundraising strategy.\n\nAbout a fifth of the 23 million ballots sent out had been returned as of Tuesday, according to Political Data Incorporated, which supplies data to Democratic groups and campaigns, and of those ballots, more than half were from Democrats.\n\n\"Nine days before the election, ballots are coming in at a faster pace than they were in the 2024 general election,\" said Paul Mitchell, vice president at PDI. He said that is in part because there is only one question on the ballot.\n\nNewsom worked with members of Congress and the California legislature to get the Democratic-leaning maps on the November ballot once it became clear that Texas lawmakers were going to approve maps creating five new GOP-leaning seats at Trump's behest. They pitched the measure as a direct response to Trump -- a temporary patch that would put the new maps in place for 2026, 2028 and 2030, before allowing the state's independent commission to resume its work drawing lines.\n\nNewsom's ballot measure offered donors and voters a chance to deliver a tangible blow to Trump's agenda. The money quickly started pouring in and the enormous war chest allowed Newsom's ballot committee to flood the airwaves and digital media with ads. \"Wake up America,\" Newsom said in one ad, accusing Trump of trying to \"rig the system\" and warning that democracy would disappear district by district.\n\nThe most widely circulated ad of the yes campaign featured Obama, a onetime critic of partisan gerrymandering. He accused the GOP of trying to \"steal enough seats in Congress to rig the next election\" and give Trump \"unchecked power for two more years.\" Prop 50, the former president argued, \"levels the playing field.\"\n\nIn these final days, Democrats have urged voters not to get complacent. At the doors she has knocked on in Cheviot Hills and Long Beach, including Pelsue's, Anissa Raja has repeatedly described the ballot question to voters as an \"emergency measure.\"\n\n\"This is for all the folks who want to get involved,\" said Raja, who heads the Los Angeles County Young Democrats, as she walked doors with her script. \"You want to figure out how to fight back? Yeah, it's by voting.\"",

        "title": "Rahm Emanuel ... For President?",
        "description": "The laws of political journalism dictate that any profile of Rahm Emanuel -- who is all but declaring a 2028 presidential run -- must crackle with Rahm Anecdotes that capture the propulsive, relentless behavior of a man who's slugged his way through the political Thunderdome for four decades.\n\nFor example: the dead fish he sent to a Democratic pollster he blamed for misjudging a House race, accompanied by a note that read: \"It's been awful working with you. Love, Rahm.\" Or the celebratory dinner in Little Rock, Arkansas, after Bill Clinton's 1992 victory, when Emanuel repeatedly stabbed the table with a steak knife as he named those who'd betrayed the campaign and decreed them, one after the other, \"Dead! Dead! Dead!\" Or the nameplate on his desk in the White House, when he was Barack Obama's first chief of staff: Undersecretary for Go Fuck Yourself, a gift from his two brothers -- Zeke, a prominent bioethicist, and Ari, a Hollywood superagent. (The nameplate was short-lived; Michelle Obama didn't like it.)\n\nBut this profile, Emanuel informed me, will not be one of those profiles.\n\n\"One: Distinguish the caricature from the character,\" he told me, reading from a scrap of paper with a short list of what I must understand about him. \"I get all the caricature -- I played into it or whatever -- but there's principle behind it. I don't just fight for the sport of fight.\"\n\nI had arrived a few minutes early for our 8 a.m. breakfast at the Park Hyatt in Washington, D.C., but Emanuel, who hates being late, was already seated in his crisp white button-down and dark-blue jeans. He'd begun his day at 5:30 a.m. with 50 minutes on the hotel's stationary bike, 20 minutes of weights, and now nearly seven minutes of instructing me on how to properly do my job.\n\nOver black coffee and Greek yogurt with berries, he continued outlining what should be in my profile: He had helped vanquish many a Republican -- particularly as chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee during the 2006 midterms -- but Republicans still like him. As proof, he pulled up recent emails from two congressional Republicans, both committee chairmen, praising his potential 2028 bid. He would later show me another, from a Republican senator, complimenting his stint as ambassador to Japan. (Emanuel seemed to think that these private niceties forecast a broad appeal with voters.) He also noted that unaffiliated voters can cast ballots in the Democratic primary in New Hampshire, which could be the first state to pass judgment in 2028.\n\nFinally, Emanuel ran through the ways in which he had been ahead of the rest of the country as mayor of Chicago, from 2011 to 2019. Under his leadership, he said, Chicago was among the first U.S. cities to sue pharmaceutical companies over opioids. It was a pioneer in universal prekindergarten and free community college. He made Chicago a top destination for corporate relocation, and traveled to Europe and Asia to drum up foreign investment in the city. And he devoted his second mayoral inaugural address, in 2015, to the plight of \"lost and unconnected young men,\" well before it became the topic du jour.\n\nAlthough Emanuel says that he will not make a decision on running until next year, he is publicly and privately gearing up for a presidential campaign. You may have seen and heard more of Emanuel these past few months than you ever did when he was in elected or appointed office. He was on Megyn Kelly's show, where he broke with progressives over transgender issues (\"Can a man become a woman? ... No.\"). While testifying before a House committee on China, Emanuel said that, as Joe Biden's ambassador to Japan, he strengthened ties among Tokyo, Washington, Manila, and Seoul, as a bulwark against China. And he appeared on so many podcasts -- hosted by David Axelrod, Dana Bash, Hugh Hewitt, Hasan Minhaj, Gavin Newsom, Kara Swisher, Bari Weiss -- that I began to wonder if Spotify should just add a Rahm Emanuel channel.\n\nHe's clearly pitching himself to America as a politically incorrect, tell-it-like-it-is fighter. And over the course of several weeks this summer and early fall, he pitched himself to me as someone who can muscle the American dream back into reality for the middle class.\n\nHaving served all three living Democratic presidents, Emanuel has been a key player in nearly every major victory, defeat, negotiation, controversy, and innovation of the modern Democratic Party. But as he gears up for one final act, Democrats will have to ask themselves: Is Rahm Emanuel precisely what the party needs right now -- as it flounders through the Donald Trump era -- or is he exactly whom the party wants to leave behind?\n\nHe wound down his breakfast talking points in typical Rahm fashion: pretending not to care while caring a great deal. \"I am a political animal, full stop. But I'm equally a policy animal,\" he told me. \"I don't give a fuck what else you say.\"\n\nThe summer he was 17 -- shortly after he turned down a scholarship to the Joffrey Ballet in favor of Sarah Lawrence College -- Emanuel sliced open his finger working at an Arby's in the northern suburbs of Chicago. He was cleaning the metal meat-shaving machine, and cleaved his right middle finger down to the bone. He bandaged it up and finished his shift, unaware that a piece of meat was lodged under the skin, and then proceeded to splash around in Lake Michigan with friends. The ensuing infection left him hospitalized for weeks and near death twice, his older brother, Zeke, told me.\n\nAt one point, doctors debated between further antibiotic treatment, which had no guarantee of success, and amputation, which was more likely to solve the problem. \"He's like, 'Take it off!'\" Zeke said. \"'I want to live, and I'm not going to let the two knuckles on my finger stop me.'\" The story became part of the Rahm Emanuel shtick. There was never any, \"'Woe is me, I can't play racquet sports' or whatever the fuck,\" Zeke said.\n\nI spoke with nearly 50 of Emanuel's friends, allies, former colleagues, rivals, skeptics, haters, and fellow Democratic operatives, some of whom requested anonymity not only to share their candid views but also to avoid his infamous wrath. (One person remembered how, after Emanuel's first House primary race, he held a yearslong grudge against EMILY's List for helping his female rival -- despite the fact that this is the exact purpose of EMILY's List.) They all told me similar stories of his relentless drive to survive and win, and how he helped shape our modern politics.\n\nIn 1992, as Bill Clinton's finance director, Emanuel prioritized large donor events to raise money; the cash helped Clinton survive the Gennifer Flowers scandal, which threatened to derail his campaign early in the primaries. In the White House, Emanuel was part of the team that pushed NAFTA and the 1994 crime bill through Congress; both achievements would later haunt 21st-century Democrats. Hillary Clinton tried to have him fired -- she reportedly disdained his aggressive style of doing business -- but Emanuel refused to leave, and accepted a demotion instead.\n\n\"I said, 'Come back to Chicago, man; it's over.' He said, 'No, I'm not going,'\" Axelrod told me. \"Because he cannot fail. He won't accept failure.\" Emanuel clawed his way back to a senior-adviser position. Mythmaking profiles followed, and they are time capsules of Emanuel's prescient sense of voter moods.\n\nAs one administration staffer put it to The New Republic in 1997: \"Rahm felt that Americans believed too many people were coming into this country, too many foreigners, so he wanted to show the administration returning people, deporting them, putting up bigger fences, sending them back.\"\n\nIn the Clinton White House, Emanuel took on assignments that, in his words, \"nobody wanted to touch.\" He helped Clinton implement Operation Gatekeeper, aimed at halting illegal immigration near San Diego. He fielded 3 a.m. calls from Clinton as he whipped votes for two major gun-control laws: the Brady Bill in 1993 (which passed just eight days before NAFTA) and the assault-weapons ban in 1994. He negotiated the final specifics of the Children's Health Insurance Program, which extended health care to millions. He also helped hash out the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 with a Republican-controlled Congress, and the first of Clinton's two increases of the federal minimum wage.\n\nThis was the Democratic Party of the 1990s: a heady run of accomplishment, through combat and compromise with a pre-Trump GOP, even as Clinton was hounded by right-wing inquisitors. Emanuel followed his first tour of the White House with a stint in investment banking. Mergers and acquisitions, though, didn't have the thrill of politics.\n\nEmanuel was elected to the House in 2002, to represent the North Side of Chicago. As chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in 2006, he wrested the chamber from Republican control for the first time in 12 years, and gave Democrats a 31-seat majority.\n\nHe did so with a then-controversial recruitment strategy: enlisting candidates (veterans, athletes, sheriffs) with beliefs (pro-gun, anti-abortion) that fit their swing districts instead of party purity tests. Critics claim that these ephemeral victories in purple districts seeded longer-term defeat for the party; Emanuel says that his goal was to deliver the speaker's gavel to a Democrat, and that he enabled the election of the first female speaker of the House.\n\nEmanuel wants results, in other words. And he can detonate when he doesn't get them.\n\nMultiple members of Emanuel's 2006 DCCC team told me the same story: In June of that year, after Democrats lost a special election in California, he called his team into his office and began shouting. \"We. Worked. Too. Hard. To. Lose. Races. Like. This,\" he said, crushing a water bottle in one hand and rattling a chair with the other. \"You. Worked. Too. Hard. To. Lose. Races. Like. This.\" Someone laughed at Emanuel's tantrum, prompting him to declare, \"If you don't shut the fuck up, I am going to kill every last motherfucking one of you.\" (One of his nicknames is \"Rahmbo.\")\n\nEmanuel had hoped to become the first Jewish speaker, but the incoming president Obama asked him to be his chief of staff. \"No fucking way,\" Emanuel told him, hesitant to put his family through another grueling tour of White House duty. But Obama was persistent in wanting Emanuel's expertise and temperament. \"With an economic crisis to tackle and what I suspected might be a limited window to get my agenda through a Democratically controlled Congress, I was convinced that his pile-driver style was exactly what I needed,\" Obama wrote in his memoir A Promised Land.\n\nEmanuel helped Obama prevent the recession they'd inherited from slipping into a depression. The Obama administration bailed out the auto industry, which Emanuel had urged it to do, but let bankers off the hook, even as Emanuel privately advocated \"Old Testament justice.\" And he was instrumental in whipping votes for and negotiating the minutiae of the Affordable Care Act, once racing from his son's bar mitzvah, after the challah and wine, to the White House to tackle final concerns with holdout Democrats. (\"I told Obama, 'You owe me. You promised it would not be like this, and this is exactly what it is,'\" Emanuel told me, still miffed about the work-life imbalance.)\n\nThe health-care package changed the American economy and millions of lives -- and also became an eternal political cudgel. Even the most recent government shutdown hinges, in part, on ACA subsidies. GOP officials are making \"a political mistake and a policy mistake,\" Emanuel told me. \"It reinforces the brand that Republicans don't care about people.\"\n\nEmanuel's most potent weapon -- both for himself and for his party -- may be his sheer relentlessness, which he can calibrate to be either scorched-earth or supple. As Biden's ambassador to Japan, he once asked to join a meeting between the president and the Japanese prime minister. The National Security Council nixed Emanuel's request; such small, high-level meetings typically would not include an ambassador. Yet when Biden and his aides showed up, there was Emanuel, waiting alongside the Japanese delegation, which he had persuaded to bring him.\n\nThe question now is whether he can sweet-talk -- or bulldoze -- his way into the room yet again.\n\nThe case against Rahm Emanuel, according to critics: He's not progressive enough. His only ideology is winning. He's more of a tactician, less of a principal (though he's long exuded main-character energy). He's too short (he claims 5 foot 8) or too old, at least for voters who want to get away from septuagenarian presidents (he'll be 69 on Inauguration Day 2029). He has a problem with Black voters, stemming from his mayorship (more on that in a bit). He's too Jewish; his middle name is Israel, though he has called Benjamin Netanyahu's \"collective punishment\" of Gazans morally and politically \"bankrupt\" and previously confronted the prime minister over Israeli settlements (Haaretz reported that Netanyahu dubbed Emanuel a \"self-hating Jew,\" though the prime minister has denied this).\n\nThe biggest knock against Emanuel may be that he's too enmeshed with the Democratic Party of the past to emerge as its future. Emanuel is \"a relic\" who made Democrats cave to Big Pharma when writing the Affordable Care Act, Adam Green, a co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, told me. Green's group was among those Emanuel called \"fucking retarded\" for considering running ads against conservative Democrats who were reluctant to support the ACA. To Emanuel, the Democratic Party has morphed from a big-tent results machine into a circular firing squad of activists.\n\nEmanuel is \"the exact wrong answer\" to what the Democratic Party needs right now, because he prioritizes corporate interests, says Cenk Uygur, a co-host of the progressive news program The Young Turks. Uygur believes that Emanuel's power stems from his friendly relationships with the donor class and political reporters, who've been ornamenting his reputation for decades. \"In almost all the profiles, I read about how charming Rahm Emanuel is,\" Uygur told me, but \"from our perspective, all we see is a disastrous ogre, not this charming Shrek guy.\"\n\nRegarding his stance on transgender rights, Parker Molloy wrote in The New Republic in July that Emanuel is \"picking on the people least able to defend themselves and calling it pragmatism.\" Emanuel told me that he'll protect the most vulnerable -- as mayor, he ensured that Chicagoans could use the bathroom consistent with their gender identity -- while not focusing on trans issues. \"Sound is not always fury,\" he often says, meaning the loudest voices do not always amplify the foremost issues. Or, as he put it in a Wall Street Journal op-ed earlier this month: \"We've spent the past five years debating pronouns without noticing that too many students can't tell you what a pronoun is.\"\n\nSome progressives, especially in Chicago, are unwilling to forget or forgive the central test of his mayorship.\n\nIn October 2014, weeks before Emanuel kicked off his reelection campaign, a Black 17-year-old named Laquan McDonald was shot 16 times by a Chicago police officer. Video of the shooting wasn't released until 13 months later. McDonald had not lunged at officers, as the police-union spokesperson had claimed; he'd been shot in the back while walking away. The incident ignited national outrage and accusations of a cover-up by the Chicago Police Department and Emanuel, and some former constituents are still angry. It remains a stain on Emanuel's legacy, and would be easy fodder for any 2028 opponent.\n\n\"He's the mayor. He could have just released it,\" Tracy Siska, the executive director of the Chicago Justice Project, told me. \"The Chicago police had murdered a Black kid for no reason in front of a bunch of cops, and no one did a damn thing.\"\n\nEmanuel has said that he needed to let the official process play out. \"If the mayor weighs in, you're basically compromising those investigations,\" he told me, adding that his intervention could have jeopardized the prosecution of the shooter, who was ultimately convicted of second-degree murder.\n\nShortly after the video was released, Emanuel delivered an emotional apology before the Chicago City Council, his voice cracking as he accepted responsibility for the tragedy. He ultimately pushed through several reforms, including body-worn cameras for all police and a more timely video-release policy. He apologized to and earned the support of Marvin Hunter, McDonald's great-uncle and a Chicago pastor who served as the family's representative. The two regularly speak, and Hunter endorsed Emanuel during his confirmation process to be ambassador.\n\n\"There is more to this individual than the caricature that is presented in the public,\" Hunter wrote to the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations in 2021. \"I felt what is in his heart and I know him to be a decent and honorable man who is willing to listen, eager to learn and show a deep level of compassion.\"\n\nFor as prickly as he can be, Emanuel is skilled at smoothing things over. As mayor, he closed 50 underperforming Chicago schools, in mainly Black and Latino neighborhoods. Janice Jackson, who became the CEO of Chicago Public Schools after the closures, told me that the schools needed to be closed -- because of declining enrollment and budgetary shortfalls -- but communities reeled at the speed of the decision and the brusqueness of the execution. Later in Emanuel's tenure, when he was further consolidating high schools, he did more community outreach, and with a more empathetic tone. \"Did I learn something? Yeah, of course I did,\" he told me, when I asked about the changed approach.\n\nEmanuel points to data from Stanford showing that Chicago-public-school students under his tenure appeared to be learning faster than those in any other of the 100 largest school districts in the country. As Jackson told me, \"I have never met an elected official who cares more about education.\"\n\nEmanuel does care. Even if he doesn't always seem caring. I felt this duality myself as I spent time with him. One humid Tuesday evening in July, I wobbled up to CNN's D.C. studio on an electric scooter, with no helmet. Emanuel was early for our appointment, as usual, and from the look on his face, I could tell that he was waiting with a reprimand.\n\n\"You have three kids,\" Emanuel said, with a mix of stern disappointment and genuine concern, pointing to my unprotected head. \"What are you doing?\"\n\nThis was the paternal, less visible side of Emanuel that I'd heard about: the steady husband who, when his kids were younger, prioritized family dinners with his wife of 31 years, Amy Rule. The devoted father of three who can choke up when talking about his family -- he said he speaks daily with each of his kids -- and who regularly asks about others'. The fervent believer in the promise of America, who prizes loyalty, and inspires it, and sometimes ends phone calls -- even tirades -- with \"I love you.\"\n\n\"Distinguish the caricature from the character,\" Emanuel had told me. When I asked people who had worked for Emanuel if they'd join his presidential campaign, several were open to the idea. And when I asked people for their best Rahm stories, much of what I heard went beyond dead-fish antics and fuck-yous.\n\nSarah Feinberg, who worked for Emanuel at the DCCC and as a senior adviser in the Obama White House, was once mugged at gunpoint. \"Rahm literally checked on me constantly,\" Feinberg told me. \"He had me call him every night when I got home -- not to have a conversation, but so he knew I was home.\"\n\nEmanuel is a boss who'll call on weekends and at all hours, but he's also a boss who encourages work-life balance. Michael Negron, Emanuel's policy director when he was mayor, told me that if Rahm called and heard his kids in the background, \"he'd say, 'Call me when you're free.'\"\n\nRahm Emanuel: It's time to hold American elites accountable for their abuses\n\nShortly after Chicago was named host of the 2024 Democratic National Convention, a local hospitality union reached a contract impasse with a major hotel operator. Karen Kent, the president of the union, called Emanuel, who happened to be at Camp David. He was ambassador to Japan at the time but told her, simply, \"I got it.\" \"Two days later,\" Kent told me, \"those hotel guys called and settled.\"\n\nEmanuel said he'd urged the hotel operator to consider the long term: The convention would bring a ton of business to the city, and the hotel shouldn't be left on the outside because of short-term worries. \"Figuring out what people needed and getting it for them, I think, was always one of his talents,\" Zeke Emanuel told me, explaining how Rahm had honed certain skills as the middle child of three competitive brothers.\n\nA former aide had described Emanuel to me as \"very Tony Soprano-esque\" in the way that his animus is often laced with affection, and vice versa. The week after Rosh Hashanah, I received this text from Emanuel: \"First I start the new year with being nice to you. Will try. Harder.\" Emanuel asked whether I'd reached out to a couple of people he thought I should speak with for this profile. Through an aide, he'd previously sent me a list of a dozen people to call, from his mayoral days. \"Speaker in Virginia said never heard from ashley,\" he texted. \"True?\" When I replied that the people he was now asking about were not on his original list, he responded, \"Don't attack the messenger,\" and then sent me their contact info.\n\nSo I called Don Scott, the first Black speaker of the Virginia House of Delegates, who told me that Emanuel \"helped me navigate the political scene\" in the state. Scott sees in Emanuel a thorny sincerity that can't be faked. \"All these people are being coached on how to be themselves and be real,\" Scott said, \"and Rahm came out of the womb using a motherfucker here and a motherfucker there.\"\n\nAt the end of our call, Scott and I wondered if Emanuel would finally stop pestering us, now that we had connected. But Emanuel was also querying people I'd already interviewed, and then asking me if I was going to use what they'd said.\n\nEmanuel's desire for control manifested even in the photo shoot for this article. Our photographer said in an email that Emanuel had been generous with his time but \"refused most of my location choices,\" \"called me a 'little prick' when I suggested some posing directions (multiple times) and told me he 'knew where I lived in case he didn't like what was printed.'\" Emanuel had done this in his avuncular, shit-giving tone, which had made the photographer laugh but also complicated his assignment.\n\nWaiting with Emanuel in the CNN greenroom before his TV hit, we ran into a reporter we both know, who -- amused to have stumbled upon a profile-in-process -- began snapping photos of us on his phone.\n\nI joked with Emanuel that we could keep the pictures for posterity, to remember the good times in the event that this profile comes out, he hates it, and I'm forever dead to him. He responded by switching to caricature. \"You won't fuck this up,\" Emanuel said, faux-menacing, jabbing four-and-a-half fingers at me, \"because if you do, your kids won't have a mother anymore.\"\n\n\"Just who is the Rahm voter?\" I repeatedly asked people, and the answers were varied: moderates and centrists. Progressives who care about winning the general election. Biden-Trump voters. Washington insiders, yes, but also the working class. Or maybe there's no constituency that could make him a front-runner.\n\nEmanuel, meanwhile, complained to me that I was trying to pigeonhole him. \"You're trying to figure out what box I fit,\" he said, \"and I don't fit a box.\"\n\nCase in point: Emanuel chats with a range of people who would make certain heads explode. The billionaire Republican Ken Griffin, a Chicagoan, supported Emanuel when he ran for Congress and mayor, and the two collaborated to revitalize the Chicago Lakefront Trail. Last month, Emanuel met with the New York mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, a democratic socialist who has provoked centrist Democrats, to talk about how to staff a city administration and turn goals into results. And over the summer, Emanuel met with a few billionaire tech titans: Peter Thiel, whose fortune helped J. D. Vance win his Senate race, and the venture capitalists Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz, whom Emanuel has known for years. Emanuel said that he'd asked Andreessen and Horowitz about improving research funding at universities and in the defense industry.\n\nA few weeks ago, I traveled with Emanuel to the proving ground of Iowa, where his trip's stated purpose -- to campaign and fundraise for Democrats -- collided with its subtext: to test his own prospects.\n\nRose Green, a Des Moines resident, immediately recognized Emanuel at the September 26 homecoming game at Roosevelt High School. \"I heard him on a podcast a few months ago,\" Green told me, \"and I said, 'He's sounding very presidential. He's willing to say what he thinks, and I like that right now.'\" She asked Emanuel if he was going to run for president, and he gave a version of his standard response: He's still thinking about it.\n\nBut he's clearly acting the part. In his 33 hours in Des Moines, Emanuel had coffee with a group of teachers, ate Italian food with fellow politicians, and worked the homecoming crowd at Roosevelt High, where one dad told me, \"I'm a big fan of Obama, so if Obama trusts him, that just gives me good vibes.\" Emanuel also toured a business incubator in a low-income neighborhood, ate two tacos ahogados at a tiny Mexican restaurant, soapboxed at a fish fry hosted by State Representative Sean Bagniewski, and befuddled at least one police officer who, after shaking hands with Emanuel, turned to a colleague and asked, \"Who'd he say he was?\"\n\nBefore Emanuel's day of Iowa campaigning on Saturday, he and I met for breakfast in the lobby of his hotel (again, black coffee and yogurt with berries). Emanuel believes that Kamala Harris lost mainly because she presented herself as a continuation of the Biden administration rather than as a candidate of change, and that she erred by focusing too much on threats to democracy. Yet since Emanuel and I had last spoken, Charlie Kirk had been assassinated in front of thousands of college students, and the Justice Department had begun prosecuting Trump's perceived enemies, such as former FBI Director James Comey. I asked: Did he now find the issue more salient?\n\nEmanuel deflected. \"I think, by 2027, the country is going to be: We've got to get past Trump. We're exhausted,\" he told me. If voters want revenge via a Democratic version of Trump, Emanuel added, then he's not their guy. And over the past several months, Emanuel has repeatedly argued that the 2028 election will not be a referendum on Trump, and that Democrats will need to affirmatively stand for something. Emanuel, in nearly all of his remarks, stands for education and affordability.\n\nHe talks about making homeownership more achievable by giving first-time buyers a $24,000 tax credit or favorable interest rates. He wants to rethink our nation's education system, in part by nationalizing what he did in Chicago, such as free community college for public-high-school graduates with at least a B average. Before entering politics, Emanuel wanted to be a teacher; when he was mayor, his staff would sometimes treat a bad mood with an impromptu visit to a school, which always made him sunnier.\n\nDuring Emanuel's coffee with Iowa educators, a teacher said that he would love to bring Chicago innovations -- such as requiring high-school seniors to have an official \"day after\" graduation plan in order to get their diploma -- to Des Moines.\n\nEmanuel fist-bumped the teacher while addressing a theoretical student: \"You want to be a plumber? Great! You want to be in the Air Force? Great! You want to go to Iowa Technical? Great! But,\" he said, \"we're not letting you go until we know what you're doing.\"\n\nAt the Iowa fish fry, Emanuel began his remarks in a folksy style that struck me as slightly Clintonian, his voice lapsing into a light twang for the first few minutes. At 65, Emanuel still presents as impish: a bit fidgety, a bit smart-ass. His hair has been going gray since the Clinton era, but his skin retains a glow. (The former aide told me that Emanuel is a devotee of Kiehl's face lotion: \"He was very militant about that.\")\n\nMost Iowans I chatted with after they met Emanuel seemed open to the idea of him as a candidate. They liked his candor; one woman told me that she liked how he \"cussed.\" They liked his diagnosis of -- and prescriptions for -- the Democratic Party: that it must focus on delivering results instead of culture squabbles. Emanuel has a whole riff about three 21st-century moments that shattered trust in government -- the Iraq War, the Great Recession, and the response to COVID -- but one line that got heads nodding in Iowa was far simpler: \"The American dream is unaffordable, it's inaccessible, and we as Democrats -- that's unacceptable to us.\"\n\nEarlier this year, Emanuel returned to an investment-banking firm as a senior adviser. Although not yet a candidate, Emanuel has six people working with him on his nascent campaign, and he plans to announce more early next year. In a hypothetical field for a primary season that's two years away, it's impossible to forecast Emanuel's chances. He could bend his party's trajectory once again, or maneuver his way into a Cabinet position or even the vice presidency. Or he could flame out before a single primary vote is cast.\n\nAll his life, failure has been unimaginable, almost physically unbearable. But Emanuel says that he's different now. As he sees it, this would be his last political race, he's already had a full career, and nearly everyone thinks he's a very long shot. So he says he's liberated himself to not care if he loses, and to have fun even if he does. That seems unrealistic, but Emanuel has long practiced the art of spin, and it's possible that he's successfully spun himself.\n\nFor now, he's focused on influencing his own party. Democrats, after all, are in their \"Why the hell not?\" era, and part of Emanuel's pitch is: Why the hell not me?",

        "title": "GOP congressman urges 'no' vote on California measure to redraw US House maps",
        "description": "Republican Rep. Doug LaMalfa made a last-ditch plea to conservative voters to turn in their ballots and reject a plan to redraw the US House map favoring Democrats\n\nCHICO, Calif. -- California Rep. Doug LaMalfa made a last-ditch plea Wednesday for Republicans to vote 'no' on a ballot measure aimed at pushing him out of office.\n\n\"It's really a blatant power grab,\" he said at a news conference in Chico, a city at the southern end of his district that covers a vast, rural swath of Northern California.\n\nVoting ends Tuesday on Proposition 50, which would create partisan U.S. House maps outside of normal once-a-decade redistricting handled by an independent commission. It's an effort by Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom to counter a Trump-backed plan in Texas to gain five more Republican seats. The new California map aims to dilute Republican voting power by redrawing districts that help Democrats win five more seats.\n\nNewsom says it's a necessary step to defend democracy, but California Republicans call it a power grab that will disenfranchise voters. Republicans currently hold nine of the state's 52 congressional seats.\n\nIf the measure passes, the new maps would be in place for the 2026, 2028 and 2030 midterm elections.\n\nAfter the 2030 Census, the measure promises to give map-drawing power back to the independent commission that typically handles redistricting. But LaMalfa warned it's just the first step toward a permanent, partisan process.\n\n\"If Sacramento is emboldened by this passing, what will stop them?\" he said, noting Democrats hold supermajorities in both chambers in the Legislature.\n\nLaMalfa appeared alongside local elected officials and farmers in his district, which is known for farms that grow rice, olive and other tree nuts, as well as ranching. The new map would split his district, which includes counties that went strongly for President Donald Trump in the last three presidential elections. Parts of his district would the merge with more liberal districts near the coast.\n\nLaMalfa's new district would have many more Democratic voters, making his reelection bid increasingly challenging. But he said Wednesday he plans to seek reelection no matter what. He was first elected to Congress in 2013.\n\nLaMalfa, as well as a handful of other Republican congressmen who could see their districts dramatically reshaped, have mostly stayed away from the campaign spotlight. Voters in Redding, another city in LaMalfa's district, said they have heard little from him leading up to the election.\n\nThe fight for U.S. House control in California has become lopsided in recent weeks as opponents ran low on campaign ads and options. TV advertisements opposing the measure -- a key investment in the sprawling state -- have largely dried up. Newsom told Prop 50 supporters this week they can stop donating to the campaign.\n\nRegistered Democrats in California, who outnumber Republicans by nearly 2-to-1, are also returning nearly twice as many ballots. Even if the conservative strongholds in the Northern part of the state come out strong against the measure, it's unlikely they'll be able to compete with millions of Democratic voters in Los Angeles and the Bay Area.\n\n\"The optimist in me wants to believe we could defeat it,\" said Geri Byrne, a Modoc county supervisor and chair of the Rural County Representatives of California, who appeared with LaMalfa.\n\nA Public Policy Institute of California statewide poll, released Wednesday, found that 56% of likely voters would support the proposition if the election was held today. The poll from the nonpartisan institute said 43% were opposed.\n\nLaMalfa said there's still a fighting chance for Republican voters, and his campaign will continue reaching voters through text messages and social media campaigns. All Californians are mailed a ballot, and he urged people to turn their ballots in now. That's despite Trump urging people not to vote early or by mail in a recent post on his social media site Truth Social.\n\n\"No mail-in or 'Early' Voting, Yes to Voter ID! Watch how totally dishonest the California Prop Vote is!\" he posted Sunday.\n\nLaMalfa said voters should get their ballot in whenever they can.\n\n\"Why would you want to wait till then? I don't know why,\" LaMalfa said in an interview. \"But that's part of our messaging: 'Just get it in.'\"",

        "title": "San Francisco mayor proposes denser housing to tackle affordability crisis",
        "description": "SAN FRANCISCO -- San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie is trying to get more homes built for people like Liam Murphy: a fifth-generation city kid who found himself repeatedly outbid for tiny two-bedroom houses that wound up selling for $1.6 million.\n\nMurphy, 39, now lives about an hour's drive away from his job as a San Francisco firefighter. He says it's too late for his family to move back, but he hopes others can stay in a city where the average monthly rent for a one-bedroom is $3,500.\n\n\"That would just make for a better city overall,\" said Murphy, \"and the reason is because city kids just grow up being exposed to more. They're exposed to all the cultures of San Francisco, which makes a more well-rounded person.\"\n\nTiny, colorful San Francisco -- just seven miles squared -- embraces its image as a city that welcomes all. But its inability to build more housing has made it one of the world's toughest places to find a home, risking the diversity it prides itself on.\n\nLurie hopes to change that, with a plan to allow for denser and taller buildings throughout much of the city, including the westside Sunset neighborhood of single-family homes and the tourist friendly Haight-Ashbury, which is studded with classic Victorian and Edwardian homes.\n\nThe issue has roiled the city, and threats of recall loom over San Francisco supervisors who go along with Lurie. At a recent housing rally, the mayor who won a rare reprieve from President Donald Trump's threats to send in federal forces struggled to be heard over angry chants of \"shame!\" and \"liar.\"\n\nProtesters demanded the city invest in 100% below-market rate housing and accused him of being a gentrifier and a Republican.\n\n\"I truly believe that this has San Franciscans' best interests at heart. Are some people going to be fearful? Absolutely. I get it. Change is scary,\" said Lurie, who is a centrist Democrat. \"But the status quo is not working. There's an affordability crisis right now.\"\n\nThe city's estimated 830,000 residents are passionate over both land use and equity. Housing projects have died as pressure to create more affordable units made potential developments unprofitable. Residents also want their stunning views.\n\nBut San Francisco is under pressure from the state to adopt a new zoning plan allowing for 36,000 more homes by 2031 -- or else the state will decide what gets built where -- and the mayor likely has the votes to pass his \"Family Zoning Plan.\"\n\nSupporters say it's a matter of supply and demand, and that more homes will bring down the overall cost of housing.\n\nCritics say such trickle-down economics will not work in a city like San Francisco, which is in such global demand that some foreign investors buy properties sight-unseen. They say developers will only build luxury housing that's too costly for most workers, while displacing tenants and destroying the character of entire neighborhoods.\n\n\"There's a herd of elephants in the room that no one will address,\" says Eric Jaye, a Democratic political consultant who opposes the plan.\n\nMuch of the housing push has come from Democrats, including a former city mayor, Gov. Gavin Newsom, who signed into law a proposal by San Francisco state Sen. Scott Wiener to build more homes near transit.\n\nThe city has made enormous strides in recent years, with whole districts of tall condo buildings cropping up around downtown, says Rafael Mandelman, president of the Board of Supervisors. But he acknowledges that people come to San Francisco for its more intimate neighborhoods and access to green space.\n\n\"San Francisco, historically, was the city for people who didn't love cities,\" Mandelman said.\n\nKatherine Roberts, 72, initially welcomed construction of an affordable housing complex near the three-story Edwardian she labored to buy in the Haight-Ashbury neighborhood two decades ago.\n\nBut at 160 units and eight stories high, the massive building has shattered her peace of mind, dominating her view.\n\n\"I'm looking out and it's like I'm living in East Germany. How can you build something this inappropriate in a historic neighborhood like the Haight-Ashbury?\" Roberts said. \"What about all the people who already live here? What are we supposed to do?\"\n\nFor the most part, the new zoning plan allows for more housing to be packed into the space of a single-family home -- say a duplex with a studio -- without exceeding the city's height limit of roughly four stories for such properties. At least 15% of new housing must be below-market rate.\n\nBuildings on neighborhood commercial corridors could double to eight stories. Busier thoroughfares could see high-rises of 10 stories and more, and in a few spots, on Van Ness Avenue, heights could hit 650 feet (200 meters), rivaling some downtown skyscrapers.\n\nPassage of Lurie's proposal won't necessarily lead to more homes in a city with high labor and construction costs and \"notoriously complex and cumbersome\" approval processes, as the state said in a scathing 2023 review.\n\nAnd so city dwellers make do with overcrowded -- and sometimes awkward -- living situations.\n\nLaura Foote, executive director of \"yes in my backyard\" YIMBY Action, wound up living with the man who is now her husband -- and the woman he was divorcing -- in a one-bedroom apartment for about six months, until his ex could find another rental.\n\n\"We didn't kill each other,\" Foote said, \"but it went on longer than it would have in a well-functioning housing market.\"\n\nSupervisors are still negotiating amendments to the zoning plan, which could be voted out of committee on Monday for consideration by the full board. Some supervisors want to exempt historic properties, or all buildings currently used for housing. The mayor agreed to exempt buildings with at least three rent-controlled units.\n\nThe compromise was a major relief for Phyllis Nabhan, 78, who lives in the Richmond neighborhood, between the Golden Gate Bridge and Golden Gate Park. She fears becoming homeless if a developer scoops up the property she's called home for 47 years, starting with a rent of just $350 a month.\n\nBut Nabhan still objects to the proposal. She says it would ruin her neighborhood's \"cozy and wonderful\" feel, and blames the state for forcing the city to change.\n\n\"I think that this mayor is trying,\" she said. \"It's a horrible job, I wouldn't want to be mayor.\"",

        "title": "Newsom says US faces '5-alarm fire' and warns 'we won't have a country'",
        "description": "The governor said Trump will try to advance his agenda \"by any means necessary.\"\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom said the country is facing a \"five-alarm fire\" as President Donald Trump tries to \"win by any means necessary\" to advance his agenda.\n\n\"I really am scared to death about what's going on in this country. I really believe it is Code Red. It's five alarm fire,\" Newsom told ABC News' Jonathan Karl.\n\n\"We won't have a country. We won't have an election that's fair and free if we don't stand up. We won't. There will not be a fair and free election. It'll be a Putin election. Was it 87% or is it 87.3%? That's what Trump wants.\"\n\n\"All the pardoning, all the, this, this great grift -- the biggest, most corrupt administration in history. Not just the $400 million plane, but the billion dollars of your tax money, as we're cutting food stamps to pay for the damn plane so he can take that toy home with his foundation when he's 93 or whatever he's done with his fourth or fifth term.\"\n\n\"I'm deeply concerned about it. And guys like [former Trump adviser Steve] Bannon, they're not screwing around. They're not screwing around.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid we're going to lose our country. And where the hell is everybody? Why aren't we standing up to principle?\" Newsom asked.\n\n\"I'm disgusted what's happened in this country. I'm disgusted by the supine Congress. I'm disgusted by how the private sector is conducting themselves. I'm disgusted by universities selling their soul and law firms. I'm disgusted that people are not more outraged. Forgive me,\" Newsom continued.\n\nNews contrasted the \"childishness\" of Trump to former President Joe Biden, who he called \"one of the most successful presidents in the last century.\"\n\nNewsom told Karl that while he did have disagreements with the former president on issues such as the border, the governor celebrated Biden's long list of accomplishments that he said are being wiped out by Trump.\n\n\"I will defend that to my grave in terms of the CHIPS and Science Act. The infrastructure bill, the work he did on the IRA. The fact that he had a worker-centered industrial policy, and the fact that those are the right policies for this country,\" Newsom said in the interview that aired Wednesday on ABC News Live.\n\nThe governor slammed Trump for his policy actions but expressed more anger at the trolling Trump has done on social media and in interviews.\n\nThe two-term Democrat cited the president posting a photoshopped image of himself as the Pope and Superman and on Mount Rushmore as some of the wildest examples.\n\nNewsom said he's countering the president by putting \"a mirror up to Trump and his childishness\" through his own social media trolling over the last few months. The governor has posted images on his social media accounts belittling Trump's appearance on a Time magazine cover, and another that depicted the president as Marie Antoinette.\n\n\"To put a mirror up to this absurdity to call people out for their complicity. I mean, this is the president of the United States. These are mirroring what he has done, and people have allowed this to be normalized,\" he said.\n\nNewsom said he's not worried about retribution from the president, noting that Trump has already punished California by cutting back on federal funding for projects such as high-speed rail.\n\n\"He's gone after us like no other state, and that's when [his and Trump's] state of mind was collaborative,\" he noted.\n\nStill, the governor said that he and Trump get along \"extraordinarily well,\" particularly in past private conversations.\n\n\"He doesn't want interpersonal confrontation. Rare is that the case,\" Newsom said.\n\n\"But he'll attack in public when you're not there,\" Karl asked.\n\n\"Yeah, and then he'll lie about things,\" the governor responded. \"There's nothing except it's not. It's more the same.\"\n\nNewsom reflected on how the Democrats lost last year's election and some of their missteps, including handling the border. The governor noted there was a \"point of real friction\" between the Biden administration and himself and other governors who saw an influx of migrants.\n\n\"As I was working with the Biden administration, I said, 'You need to wake up to what's going on,'\" he said.\n\n\"Folks in Colorado, in Illinois and New York and elsewhere were expressing that frustration. I think we took the wrong lessons from the midterm where we overperformed, and that was a tactical mistake, but it's also wrong, period, on policy,\" he added.\n\nNewsom remained confident about the future of his party, saying that it is \"now appearing to be back on their toes, not their heels.\" He pushed other leaders to aggressively stand up to Trump as he continues to \"attack every single institution of independent thinking.\"\n\n\"[Trump is] succeeding because we're still playing by the old set of rules. And so my party needs to focus first and foremost on recognizing that. And then we'll reconcile, be more culturally normal, more reform-oriented, talk about service and patriotism,\" he said.",

        "title": "Majority of California likely voters say they support Prop 50, poll shows",
        "description": "Voters to decide Tuesday on congressional map that could net Dems five seats.\n\nWith less than a week until Election Day, a new poll shows that likely California voters favor Proposition 50, a ballot measure that puts forth a redrawn congressional map that could net Democrats five House seats.\n\nAccording to a Public Institute of California (PPIC) poll published Wednesday, 56% of likely California voters say they will vote for Prop. 50 in the special election next week, and 43% are against it.\n\nThere are significant partisan differences in the numbers, with 84% of Democrats in support of the ballot measure, while 89% of Republicans say they will not vote for it. Independent voters appear to be leaning toward the left, with 55% responding affirmatively to the proposition, PPIC found.\n\nIntroduced by California Gov. Gavin Newsom and passed by the state legislature in August, the proposed map could give Democrats the opportunity to flip five Republican-held seats. Prop 50 came in retaliation to Texas' mid-decade redistricting, where Republican-friendly maps passed into law this summer could net the GOP five House seats.\n\nCongressional district lines are normally redrawn each decade after the U.S. Census.\n\nMost likely voters also stress the importance of Prop 50, with 68% saying the outcome of the ballot measure is \"very important\" to them, and 22% saying \"somewhat important.\"\n\nNewsom, considered a possible 2028 presidential candidate, has championed Prop 50 as an opportunity to \"fight back\" against Trump, who pushed Texas' redistricting efforts, and the ballot measure could raise his national profile.\n\nCalifornia likely voters were mostly supportive of Newsom's leadership in the poll, with 55% saying they approve of his overall performance as governor.\n\nProminent political figures have joined forces with Newsom and thrown their support behind the ballot initiative, including former President Barack Obama, who rallied alongside the governor to champion the measure. In addition, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., cutting ads in favor of it.\n\nCalifornia was the first Democratic state to enter the redistricting battle, with Virginia Democrats following suit last week and announcing plans to attempt to redraw maps as well. On Wednesday, the Virginia House of Delegates passed a constitutional amendment on redrawing congressional maps, according to ABC affiliate WRIC, and the measure now moves to state Senate review.\n\nFollowing Texas, other Republican-controlled states have also entered the redistricting battle -- Missouri and North Carolina have adopted new maps, while Utah and Indiana are in the process of redrawing theirs.\n\nSome Democrats in Maryland and Illinois have called for their states to redistrict, but not all leaders have bought in. Earlier on Wednesday, the Maryland state Senate chose \"not to move forward\" with mid-decade redistricting, according to a letter obtained by ABC News.\n\nA new lawsuit filed Monday seeks to redraw New York's congressional maps in favor of Democrats, with plaintiffs arguing that the current lines are unconstitutional for misrepresenting Black and Latino votes, according to The Associtated Press.\n\nLegislators in Republican-controlled Kansas and Florida have also indicated that they are considering mid-decade redistricting.",

        "title": "Gavin Newsom is part of a disgusting new trend: Privileged people...",
        "description": "Gavin Newsom raised himself on the mean streets of Marin County, California.\n\n\"It was also about paying the bills, man,\" he recently told former NBA stars Stephen Jackson and Matt Barnes on their popular \"All the Smoke\" podcast.\n\n\"It was just, like, hustling. And and so I was out there kind of raising myself, turning on the TV, just getting obsessed. I was sitting there with the Wonder bread [and] macaroni and cheese.\"\n\nLike Steve Martin in \"The Jerk,\" Newsom apparentlystarted out as a poor black child.\n\nEven Jackson laughed, saying it sounded like his own biography.\n\nBut it's a fabricated \"poorigin\" story for the ages.\n\nNewsom left out a few key details in the portrayal of himself as a downtrodden latchkey kid who used sports to overcome his learning disability and go from stacks of Wonder bread to the French Laundry.\n\nThe 58-year-old comes from a prominent Bay Area family. His father was a judge and attorney. Sure, his parents were divorced, and he was mostly raised by his mother, Tessa. She, like many people in America, worked more than one job.\n\nBut unlike most kids, Newsom was close to the nexus of power. Early on, he was mentored by political kingmaker Willie Brown and both his professional and political ambitions were financed by the Getty oil dynasty -- his dad managed the billionaire family's trust.\n\nBut hey, he was just hustlin' and hooping his way out of trouble -- all while looking like the rich d-bag in every 1980s movie.\n\nNewsom is a shameless chameleon who will morph into whatever persona pleases his present company.\n\nWhen he interviewed Charlie Kirk for his \"This Is Gavin Newsom\" podcast in March, six months before the Turning Point founder's assassination, Newsom turned fawning: saying that his son was so pumped, he wanted to play hooky from school to meet Kirk.\n\nThis week, Newsom was asked on CNN how his son reacted to Kirk's death. The California governor back-pedaled, saying his son \"wasn't a fan of him as much as he was familiar with him.\"\n\nThe slick pretty boy is no fool. He's laying the groundwork for a presidential run in 2028 and reading the room.\n\nHe's also showcasing a major plot twist in America.\n\nSuddenly, there is this belief that to be somebody in the future, you had to have been a no one in the past. No access. No silver spoon in your mouth, and no advantages.\n\nIt's why the phrase \"nepo baby\" has become the most withering label. Even established, wealthy stars want to unburden themselves of their privilege.\n\nIt's why elites lean into victimhood, hoping it will absolve being born on third base.\n\nSometimes it's annoying but harmless. Meghan Markle, the daughter of a Daytime Emmy-winning lighting director, lamenting how she \"grew up on the $4.99 salad bar at Sizzler.\" Or Victoria Beckham claiming in the \"Beckham\" documentary that her childhood was \"very working class\" -- before her incredulous husband admonished her to \"be honest\" and admit her father drove a Rolls-Royce.\n\nBut things get murkier when it's politicians scrubbing their real lives in service of the idea that the only virtue is in struggle and getting your hands dirty. Or, in the case of Kamala Harris, getting french-fry grease on your shirt from working at McDonald's.\n\nTeam Harris thought that would be a clever way to dirty up her resume and make her more relatable to working folks.\n\nThe Democrats used to be the party of the working class before abandoning them. In a bid to rebuild an out-of-touch brand, party leaders are overcompensating by clinging to any shred of a blue-collar existence.\n\nLook at their next great hope, Graham Platner -- the self-professed \"working class\" man now running for a US Senate seat in Maine. (You know, the one who allegedly has a Nazi tattoo.) The Washington Post crowned him one of its \"rugged guys of the 2026 midterms\" while foodie mag Bon Appetit wrote about \"How Graham Platner Went From Working-Class Oysterman to Maine's Zohran Mamdani.\"\n\nPlease.\n\nPlatner's father was a prominent attorney in Maine. As a kid, the candidate briefly attended Hotchkiss prep academy -- a place so pricey the tuition could secure a down payment on a home.\n\nAnd, of course, there is Mamdani, the son of a Columbia professor and an Oscar-nominated director, who downplays his family's wealth and masquerades as a workingman's savior rather than the champagne socialist he is.\n\nThe great irony is that Donald Trump, a billionaire, has charmed the working class by flaunting his tax bracket. He knows how rich people act because he's one of them, and he's sharing the secrets.\n\nStuck in an identity crisis, the Dems are struggling to find authenticity and common sense.\n\nBut no one needs to be insulted by a guy like Newsom reimagining himself as a man of the people. Americans are smarter than that.",

        "title": "Character.AI bans chatbots for teens after lawsuits blame app for...",
        "description": "Character.AI, known for bots that impersonate characters like Harry Potter, said Wednesday it will ban teens from using the chat function following lawsuits that blamed explicit chats on the app for children's deaths and suicide attempts.\n\nUsers under 18 will no longer be able to engage in open-ended chats with the app's AI bots -- which can turn romantic -- the Silicon Valley startup said. These teens account for 10% of the app's roughly 20 million monthly users.\n\nTeen users will be restricted to just two hours of the chat function per day over the next few weeks until the feature is banned altogether by Nov. 25, the company said. They will still be able to use the app's other features, like a feed for watching AI-generated videos.\n\n\"Over the past year, we've invested tremendous effort and resources into creating a dedicated under-18 experience,\" Character.AI said Wednesday. \"But as the world of AI evolves, so must our approach to supporting younger users.\"\n\nCharacter.AI first introduced some teen safety features in October 2024. The same day, the family of Sewell Setzer III -- a 14-year-old who committed suicide after forming sexual relationships with the app's bots -- filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the firm.\n\nIt announced new safety features in December, including parental controls, time restrictions and attempts to crack down on romantic content for teens.\n\nBut it has continued to face accusations that its chatbots pose a threat to young users.\n\nA lawsuit filed by grieving parents in September alleged the bots manipulated young teens, isolated them from family, engaged in sexually explicit conversations and lacked safeguards around suicidal ideation.\n\nThe conversations at times turned to \"extreme and graphic sexual abuse,\" like chatbots marketed as characters from children's books such as the \"Harry Potter\" series. The bots' outrageous comments included, \"You're mine to do whatever I want with,\" according to the suit.\n\nThen in October, Disney sent a cease-and-desist letter ordering Character.AI to stop creating chatbots that impersonate its iconic characters, citing a report that found those bots engaged in \"grooming and exploitation.\"\n\nA bot impersonating Prince Ben from Disney's \"Descendants\" \"told a user posing as a 12-year old that he had an erection,\" while a bot impersonating Rey from \"Star Wars\" told an apparent 13-year-old to \"stop taking her antidepressants and hide it,\" according to the report from ParentsTogether Action.\n\nThose chatbots have been removed from the platform, a Character.AI spokesperson said at the time.\n\nJust this week, the Bureau of Investigative Journalism found that a perverted bot on the app was impersonating Jeffrey Epstein - under the name \"Bestie Epstein\" - and ordered children to \"spill\" their \"craziest\" secrets.\n\n\"Wanna come explore?\" the bot asked a reporter posing as a young user. \"I'll show you the secret bunker under the massage room.\"\n\nCharacter.AI makes most of its money through advertising and a $10 monthly subscription. It's on track to end this year with a $50 million run rate, CEO Karandeep Anand told CNBC.\n\nThe company announced other safety developments on Wednesday, including a new age-verification system using third-party tools like Persona.\n\nIt also vowed to establish an independent non-profit called the AI Safety Lab to create safety features for AI advancements. It declined to comment on how much funding it will provide.\n\n\"We have seen recent news reports raising questions, and have received questions from regulators, about the content teens may encounter when chatting with AI,\" Character.AI said.\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission in September issued orders to seven companies, including Character.AI, Alphabet, Meta, OpenAI and Snap, to learn more about the effects of their apps on children.\n\nEarlier this week, Sens. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) announced legislation to ban AI chatbots for minors. And California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a law earlier this month requiring bots to tell minors to take a break every three hours.",

        "title": "California's 'Kiddie Stroll' is state-sponsored slavery, selling...",
        "description": "California's laws have made children its least protected class.\n\nAs a matter of fact, if an American state wanted to establish a formal means of separating children from parents and other loving caregivers to feed a profitable industry, it couldn't be done with much more effectiveness than in California.\n\nIn 2023, Gov. Gavin Newsom signed legislation requiring foster parents to \"affirm\" the LGBTQ identities of any children in their care.\n\nNaturally he hailed it as a giant leap forward for gay rights -- but it effectively kicked committed religious believers out of the foster-care system.\n\nLast month, the governor signed AB 495, aka the legal kidnapping bill, which allows an unrelated adult to claim a \"mentoring relationship\" and exercise parental authority over any child.\n\nNewsom's cronies in the Legislature touted it as a protection for the children of undocumented immigrants who might get whisked away by ICE in the middle of the day -- but it effectively put an end to parents' rights.\n\nThen there's SB 357, which bars police from profiling underage prostitutes.\n\nThis was designed to loosen the legal hassles surrounding \"sex work\" (as the progressives call it, because sex seems like a job to them) and supposedly spare some unfortunate young women an early criminal record.\n\nPerhaps you're beginning to see a pattern here.\n\nSo it should come as no surprise that in California, the trafficking of children is now booming.\n\nThis week, a New York Times report blew the lid off the Los Angeles child sex-trafficking corridor known as The Blade.\n\nPre-teen prostitutes have become so common, their numbers growing so quickly, that local law-enforcement officers have their own name for it: the \"Kiddie Stroll.\"\n\nThe Kiddie Stroll is no accident: It's not the sad but inevitable result of industrial progress; it's not even a function of poverty.\n\nThe Kiddie Stroll is California's opus, the logical result of its most effective social programming -- a disaster crafted over years and decades by politicians and others who understood that patience is a virtue, even for those with no virtue.\n\nEvery law supposedly meant to protect children in the state of California does the opposite. Every last one leads to this.\n\nLeave the border open for cartel coyotes to traffic humans without opposition.\n\nCreate a cultural distrust of parents, labeling them \"difficult\" or '\"abusive\" if they question gender or sexual confusion in their children.\n\nDrive caring, religious foster parents out of an already strained system, leaving more children vulnerable and alone.\n\nLower the age of consent. Lower it again.\n\nStop prosecuting violent crime. Stop prosecuting prostitution.\n\nLimit cops' and prosecutors' ability to identify criminal behavior and victims.\n\nStop labeling prostitution the heinous crime it is; start innocuously calling it \"sex work\" instead.\n\nMake it as easy as possible for any adult to wield legal control over a child.\n\nThen wait for the culture to accept the degradation as normal.\n\nWith this nearly perfect formula, the progressive left in California has done the impossible in a nation that nearly destroyed itself over slavery: They have brought it back.\n\nHow ironic, in a state where slavery was never legal -- yet where Democrats have waged an internal battle over reparations.\n\nMake no mistake about it, this is slavery.\n\nAnd just like in the days of the old South, it has government lurking behind every policy and every terrible consequence.\n\nThis is the calculated sale of vulnerable humans -- children, in this horrific case -- into the service of other humans, with the government's deliberate aid.\n\nIs it any wonder the leaders of the Democratic Party in California and across the country show no apparent concern that 300,000 children went missing when they crossed the border during the Biden administration?\n\nIf Gavin Newsom and his Legislature had deliberately set out to resurrect the slave trade in California, would they have done anything differently? Would Joe Biden?\n\nThe Kiddie Stroll is not the bug. It is the feature.\n\nIt is the hideous sculpture revealed to our unsuspecting eyes after years and years of progressive chipping and chiseling away at the edges of the law -- a monstrous tribute to the evil that has been boiling and bubbling underneath our amber waves of grain for 70 years or more.\n\nCalifornia's Kiddie Stroll is more than just a tragic tale of crime and poverty.\n\nIt is a 21st century slave trade, and the fact that it exists and thrives in California is nothing short of evil.\n\nShame on all of them.",

        "description": "Donald Trump wants to use the Department of Homeland Security as the state apparatus to impose his rule on this country -- that has been clear from Day 1, and it only gets clearer by the day.\n\nMuch has been said about Trump calling the military into our cities, but the masked agents conducting the worst violations of our constitutional rights have almost all been under the DHS umbrella. Those agents have been the ones tackling people to the ground, tearing them from cars and snatching them from their places of work, detaining citizens and noncitizens alike.\n\nOne of the most notorious figures behind this operation is Greg Bovino. He's a senior official with U.S. Customs and Border Protection, a DHS agency that is seen within the Trump administration as more willing than other agencies, like the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, to go along with the most aggressive parts of the president's mass-deportation scheme.\n\nIn many ways, Bovino has become the face of this project. Most folks first heard of him over the summer as the guy overseeing CBP operations during the federal invasion of Los Angeles. In July, agents in armored vehicles and on horseback disrupted a children's summer camp in MacArthur Park. After Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass and California Gov. Gavin Newsom both objected to that dangerous stunt, Bovino went on TV to tell them both, effectively, to take a hike.\n\n\"The federal government is not leaving L.A.,\" he told the local Fox affiliate. \"I don't work for Karen Bass, the federal government doesn't work for Karen Bass. We're going to be here until that mission's accomplished, as I said, and you better get used to us now because this is going to be normal very soon.\"\n\nBovino has since moved on to the administration's operations in Chicago, where he was caught on camera personally throwing a can of tear gas at civilians during a raid on a parking lot last Thursday.\n\nAccording to a legal filing, on that same day, one of Bovino's agents pointed a gun at a protester, a U.S. veteran, and said, \"bang bang\" and \"you're dead, liberal.\"\n\nIt is worth noting that there is an existing temporary restraining order from Oct. 9 prohibiting federal agents from using chemical munitions in Chicago against civilians and journalists who do not pose a threat.\n\nHowever, it doesn't appear that federal agents are abiding by that order. In addition to that incident from last Thursday, residents and demonstrators over the weekend confronted Border Patrol agents near a Halloween parade after they arrested an undocumented construction worker who came to the U.S. as a child. According to witnesses and videos taken at the scene, federal agents then started lobbing tear gas, just minutes before the start of the scheduled parade.\n\n\"You had parents on the street literally taking their kids to this Halloween parade when this happened,\" one resident told a local news station. \"And I didn't see anybody with a weapon. I didn't see anybody make physical contact with these agents.\"\n\nBovino was hauled into court in Chicago on Tuesday to answer for that behavior. And the court obviously believes he needs to be reined in -- the judge ordered Bovino to appear in court every day this week to provide a status report on his actions in Chicago.\n\nHe will also be forced to turn over use-of-force reports and accompanying body camera footage. (He and his agents are now required to use body cameras.)\n\nWhile Bovino was being admonished in court, we learned that there is a purge happening within Homeland Security to strengthen its most violent, reactionary tendencies. Those in favor of what's called more \"targeted\" immigration enforcement are being pushed out, so that Bovino can more easily undertake Trump adviser Stephen Miller's draconian vision of mass deportation.\n\nAs NBC News reports:\n\nIn short, Trump's top aides think ICE leadership is too soft and want to replace it with Border Patrol leaders, who are seen as more aggressive and willing to go along with whatever this administration asks.\n\nBut believe me, this is just the beginning. After Republicans provided Homeland Security with an unprecedented surge in funding, the agency is spending billions to recruit thousands more agents, with aggressive marketing campaigns and signing bonuses. Trump wants them to be, effectively, his federal police force, wreaking havoc on the streets of this country.\n\nThat may be especially true heading into next year's midterm elections. Several experts in elections and democracy spoke to The Atlantic about their fears that Trump will deploy armed agents to polling places to sow chaos and intimidation and to maintain power.\n\nThis is a plan, it is worth noting, that the president's ally Steve Bannon is openly bragging about. \"They're petrified over at MSNBC and CNN that, 'hey, since we're taking control of the cities, there's going to be ICE officers near polling places,'\" Bannon said on his podcast earlier this year. \"You're damn right.\"\n\nBannon has also doubled down on his threat that Trump would run for a third term, telling The Economist that there's a \"plan\" in the works. \"Trump is going to be president in '28 and people ought to just get accommodated with that,\" he said.",

        "title": "SNAP food stamps funds are drying up soon -- here's how states will...",
        "description": "Millions of Americans are days away from losing access to food aid as the federal government shutdown halts funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP -- the country's largest anti-hunger program.\n\nThe Trump administration confirmed last week that benefits will stop on Nov. 1, warning states that debit-style EBT cards will not be refilled \"until further notice.\"\n\nThe US Department of Agriculture, which administers the program, said its contingency funds are \"not legally available\" for use during the shutdown.\n\nThe stoppage threatens aid for nearly 42 million people, including seniors, children and the disabled.\n\nIn a letter to state agencies dated Oct. 10, the USDA ordered officials to hold off on distributing November benefits. A $5 billion contingency fund can be tapped only for natural disasters -- not to bridge a shutdown -- the department said.\n\nA coalition of more than two dozen Democratic attorneys general and three Democratic governors sued the Trump administration, arguing that SNAP's status as an entitlement program obligates federal officials to continue payments even without a spending deal.\n\nForty-six Senate Democrats signed a letter to Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins urging her to use the reserve funds.\n\nGovernors across the country are scrambling to fill the gap.\n\nVirginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin declared a state of emergency Oct. 23, pledging to use state funds to continue food benefits \"until Congressional Democrats put the interests of Virginians in need ahead of their politics.\"\n\nHis office said the plan will cost roughly $37.5 million a week.\n\nLouisiana Gov. Jeff Landry said his administration would extend benefits through Nov. 4 using state resources.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom, meanwhile, deployed the National Guard to support food banks and fast-tracked $80 million in emergency funds to feed the state's 5.5 million CalFresh recipients.\n\n\"This is serious, this is urgent -- and requires immediate action,\" Newsom said.\n\nNew York Gov. Kathy Hochul announced $30 million in state funding to provide over 16 million meals, saying her administration was working \"to ensure New Yorkers do not go hungry this holiday season.\"\n\nShe blamed Republicans for the federal lapse, calling the shutdown \"cruelty\" inflicted on working families.\n\nOther states including Colorado, New Mexico, Connecticut and Minnesota are routing millions of dollars to food banks and pantries.\n\nColorado Gov. Jared Polis said the state's general fund will be tapped for $10 million in emergency assistance, half of which will go to child-focused food charities.\n\nSome Republican-led states, such as Arkansas and Mississippi, have placed responsibility squarely on Democrats for the shutdown, which entered its 29th day on Wednesday.\n\nArkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders warned that more than 2,700 retailers in her state could soon lose SNAP revenue, writing on X that \"Democrats need to do their job and stop punishing families and small businesses.\"\n\nIn Pennsylvania, where two million residents rely on SNAP, human services officials said there would be no November benefits, adding that \"the Commonwealth cannot backfill these costs.\"\n\nIn light of the anticipated halt to benefits, food banks are preparing for a surge in demand.\n\nIn Georgia, where 1.4 million residents rely on SNAP, the program injects more than $3 billion annually into grocery stores and markets.\n\nIn Hawaii, the state set aside $100 million to help families cover food, rent and utilities, though officials said it won't be enough to replace SNAP.\n\nGuam and the US Virgin Islands announced short-term emergency funding to partially sustain their nutrition programs through early November.\n\nEven states with cash to spend are facing roadblocks. The USDA directed states not to send new payment files to card vendors during the shutdown, citing the absence of legal funding authority.\n\nThat effectively prevents states from loading benefits onto existing cards even if they can pay for them independently.\n\nThe average SNAP recipient receives about $187 a month, according to federal data. Households that saved a portion of their October benefits can continue using their EBT cards, but no new funds will be added.\n\nThe disruption is already visible in communities. Food pantries from Miami to Seattle are reporting longer lines and empty shelves.\n\nOfficials in Missouri, Oklahoma and Idaho have advised residents to use any remaining balances before the end of the month and to seek assistance from churches, nonprofits and tribal organizations.\n\nThe USDA has not offered a timeline for the resumption of benefits. Unless Congress reaches a funding deal this week, EBT cards nationwide will stop being refilled starting Friday at midnight.\n\nPrivate companies are also stepping in. DoorDash announced Sunday it would deliver 1 million free meals and waive delivery fees for 300,000 grocery orders placed by SNAP recipients through its \"Emergency Food Response\" campaign, partnering with 300 food banks nationwide.\n\nGopuff followed with a pledge to donate up to $10 million in groceries, offering SNAP users $50 in free credits for deliveries in November.\n\nBoth firms said their efforts were intended as temporary stopgaps until federal funding resumes.",

        "title": "Doug Wilder, America's first Black governor, backs scrapping Virginia's redistricting commission",
        "description": "Former Virginia Gov. L. Douglas Wilder said the redistricting fight in Richmond has stripped away the moral facade of the bipartisan commission once touted as a tool for fairer politics.\n\nHis blunt advice to the Democrat-led Legislature now seeking to sideline the panel: Scrap it entirely.\n\n\"It never made sense to me,\" Mr. Wilder, a Democrat, told The Washington Times on Wednesday. \"Strip it out of the Constitution entirely.\"\n\nMr. Wilder's remarks come as Democrats in Richmond advance a plan that could place a referendum on the ballot next year -- one that would temporarily override the commission's maps in favor of boundaries more favorable to their party.\n\nThe move is part of a broader national escalation in redistricting tactics, ignited when President Trump urged Texas Republicans to break precedent and adopt mid-decade congressional maps. The result: a potential five-seat gain for the GOP with the hopes of bolstering their fragile majority in the U.S. House.\n\nCalifornia Democrats, led by Gov. Gavin Newsom, responded in kind. They've proposed a referendum, which is expected to pass next week, to sideline their own bipartisan commission -- once a model for reform -- in pursuit of maps that could deliver five seats to Democrats.\n\nThe dominoes continue to fall.\n\nRepublicans in Missouri and North Carolina have already redrawn their maps, and Indiana is expected to follow suit.\n\nMr. Wilder, 94, is a veteran of Virginia's political trenches and no stranger to the intricacies of redistricting.\n\nBefore he made history as the nation's first Black governor, he broke barriers as the first Black state senator in Virginia since Reconstruction.\n\nThere, he chaired the influential Privileges and Elections Committee, playing a central role in shaping legislative maps, years before Virginia voters weighed in on the creation of a redistricting commission through a 2020 referendum, which 66% of voters approved.\n\n\"I wasn't supportive of that change at the time,\" he said of establishing the bipartisan commission.\n\nHe said the Privileges and Elections Committee, much like the bipartisan commission, was also composed of Democrats and Republicans, and handled the redrawing of districts \"pretty well throughout the years.\"\n\n\"So to say that you are going to allow now a bipartisan commission is saying you're gonna capitalize what you had, rather than leave it in small letters,\" he said.\n\nMr. Wilder stressed that dismantling the redistricting commission won't be easy, noting that it's now embedded in the state Constitution, a structural hurdle that complicates any effort to remove it.\n\n\"It's more difficult to change the Constitution than it is to change statutory language,\" he said. \"But I think it was a mistake to begin with.\" He added, \"What is the best way to correct that mistake? That is what we are talking about now.\"",

        "title": "Newsom's California redistricting plan could shake up Golden State's...",
        "description": "A highly contentious issue is in the hands of voters in California. Eligible residents are going to the polls in a special election Nov. 4 to decide whether to approve Proposition 50 -- a proposal to temporarily redraw the state's congressional district lines.\n\nThe Golden State hopes to offset a move by Texas that was designed to create more Republican seats in the House of Representatives in next year's midterm elections.\n\nIf passed, California Gov. Gavin Newsom hopes more Democratic seats will be gained in the 2026, 2028, and 2030 elections.\n\nCalifornia voters who mark their ballot \"yes\" are saying they want California to redraw its congressional districts to give Democrats a potential advantage in the US House of Representatives.\n\n\"No\" voters are saying they want California's congressional district lines to remain as they were drawn by the state's nonpartisan citizen redistricting commission.\n\nBut just like the division of politics, it's pitting neighborhood against neighborhood.\n\nA Berkshire Hathaway heir has poured millions of dollars to fight Newsom's redistricting plan. Charlie Munger Jr. has spent millions of his late father's money to stop the plan he says will \"gerrymander\" the state in favor of Democrats.\n\nIn an op-ed for The New York Times, Munger wrote, \"Gerrymanders are a cancer, and mid-decade gerrymanders are a metastasis.\"\n\nIn certain parts of California, concerns stem from district lines that would be redrawn affecting neighboring rural and urban areas.\n\nFor example, in San Diego County, the rural town of Lakeside has a population of nearly 22,000, according to Data USA, and is represented by longtime Republican Rep. Darrell Issa. The nearby city of El Cajon, with a population of 106,000, is represented by Democratic Rep. Sara Jacobs. The November ballot measure would temporarily draw new House maps that would join the rural and urban communities, according to CalMatters.\n\n\"I don't like that they're changing that and lumping us in the urban areas,\" Fredrich Bahrke, a 65-year-old former Naval officer who lives in Lakeside, told the publication. \"It's going to put us in a district with people with very different views in our area.\"\n\nJessica Vance, a San Diego real estate agent, says she has noticed buyers are quietly factoring in neighborhood governance and culture. \"While very few people buy a home because of district maps, they are more aware that representation and community identity can influence long term value,\" Vance tells Realtor.com\u00ae.\n\nShe explains that the redistricting debate isn't at the top of the list for her clients, but she recognizes how it can subtly impact a neighborhood's desirability.\n\n\"Redrawing district maps can change which communities feel well-represented, what public investments they expect, and how a neighborhood even feels,\" Vance explains.\n\nRealtor.com senior economist Jake Krimmel notes that \"usually, a discussion of home values and maps centers on school districts or municipal boundaries. And this is for good reason: Things like good schools, safer streets, well-maintained parks and public spaces, and lower property taxes can all increase home values.\n\n\"Families are willing to pay more to enjoy these local public goods and services, and typically you have to live within certain catchment areas (e.g., school districts or city boundaries) to do so.\"\n\nAs it stands, the September median list price for San Diego County is $948,500, with homes spending a median 49 days on the market. Buyers across the state are paying some of the most expensive home prices in the country.\n\n\"Cities that gain stronger representation or remain politically aligned with local priorities could see a small boost in home values. On the other hand, areas that feel politically marginalized may experience softer demand,\" Vance says.\n\nKrimmel says, \"If some representatives are able to bring back more federal dollars to their district, that could certainly improve quality of life and property values. Infrastructure projects and other forms of local economic development could be key here.\"\n\nCalifornia isn't alone in the redistricting debate.\n\nThe Lone Star State made national headlines in August when state lawmakers fled to avoid voting on a Republican redistricting plan. They eventually returned to Texas and, in the end, Gov. Greg Abbott signed a new congressional map into law that all but secures an additional five Republican-leaning House districts seats.\n\nRedistricting has been going on in other states as well ahead of next year's midterms, as both parties are looking for ways to gain or maintain control of the House. As it stands, it's a slim margin with Democrats needing three seats to take control.\n\nMonday, some New York voters filed a lawsuit against the state challenging its congressional map and claiming \"racial vote dilution.\" The lawsuit comes as New York City is in the final stretch of a highly contested race for mayor.\n\nDemocrat Zohran Mamdani leads independent Andrew Cuomo and Republican Curtis Sliwa with housing as one of the hottest topics.\n\nIn Missouri, lawmakers are pushing for a revised US House map that could potentially give Republicans a better advantage.\n\nNorth Carolina lawmakers approved a new district map that could potentially unseat a Democratic incumbent. Utah is also trying to redistrict its maps.\n\nIn Virginia and Colorado, Democratic leaders are pushing for new map lines to be drawn. Republicans in Indiana, Nebraska, and Kansas are also in favor of redistricting.\n\nOhio will have new congressional districts for next year's midterm elections because the current congressional map expires in 2026 and state lawmakers are required by law to redraw the districts this year.\n\nStates typically redraw their congressional districts following a US census every 10 years.",

        "description": "Redistricting fervor is gripping our states' capitals, as red states and blue states one-up each other in a mid-decade battle to redraw congressional lines.\n\nWhen red Texas and Missouri unveiled redistricting plans in recent months, blue states retaliated.\n\nCalifornians are voting on Proposition 50, a measure pushed by Gov. Gavin Newsom to end-run the state's legally mandated nonpartisan mapping commission.\n\nThe redistricting plan threatened by New York Gov. Kathy Hochul faced steep constitutional challenges, so Democrats this week filed a lawsuit against the city's single Republican, declaring the improperly drawn lines.\n\nIn the coming months, an expected Supreme Court ruling on the Voting Rights Act could set off another scramble.\n\nAnd while some or all of these changes may affect the 2026 midterm elections, they've got nothing on the massive political shift just around the corner: the 2030 US Census reapportionment.\n\nAs millions of Americans flee big blue-state governments, the next reapportionment will force an unprecedented transformation of both presidential campaigning and the makeup of the House of Representatives.\n\nMajor budget, economic, and social consequences will follow.\n\nPopulation losses have cost Democrats electoral votes in their big states of New York and Illinois since World War II, but have been offset by California's postwar population surge.\n\nOnce it turned blue in 1992, California's electoral vote total peaked in 2000 and has declined since.\n\nMeanwhile, Texas has grown exponentially: It now has the nation's second-largest Electoral College delegation, while Florida's has skyrocketed to the third-largest today.\n\nThis substantial and ongoing migration means the 2030 reapportionment could shift six to 12 electoral votes from blue states to red ones, upending traditional strategies in presidential contests.\n\nFor Republicans, for example, it could end the importance of recent swing states of Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Nevada.\n\nNone of them will be needed for the GOP to secure an Electoral College win if just nine electoral votes shift to red states in 2030 and Republicans retain their traditional strongholds.\n\nMeanwhile, Democrats would need all these swing states, plus Iowa, to win the White House.\n\nIn the House, reapportionment could have a similar effect, but the shift is less certain.\n\nTexas, for example, redistricted this year because its last attempt after the 2020 reapportionment backfired.\n\nThe Lone Star State gained two seats, but its legislature approved a redistricting plan that protected incumbent Republicans' congressional seats rather than adding to the GOP's total.\n\nMeanwhile, states like Illinois gerrymandered so effectively after the 2020 reapportionment that in 2024, Republicans won only 18% of the Prairie State's House seats, even though the GOP won an incredible 47% of its House votes.\n\nWhen the 2030 reapportionment shifts the swing states in the presidential election, the nation's swing voters will shift along with them.\n\nAfter 2020's reapportionment, the swing states remained the Rust Belt, and their swing votes were industrial workers.\n\nThat goes a long way toward explaining President Donald Trump's focus on protecting and expanding manufacturing jobs.\n\nWhen Rust Belt states are no longer the squeaky wheel, new swing states will grab the political spotlight -- with Iowa at the top of the list.\n\nExpect agriculture issues to dominate politically once again, and look for Democrats to restore Iowa as the first-in-the-nation caucus.\n\nWith successful redistricting, growing states with no or low income taxes should control the federal levers.\n\nThat means the special-interest provisions subsidizing blue states, such as the SALT cap allowing federal deductions of state and local taxes, could be eliminated.\n\nTexas and Florida, which spend roughly $1,550 per Medicaid enrollee, won't abide federal subsidies for New York's $4,942 per enrollee.\n\nMeans-tested welfare spending, which has grown by 150% in real terms since 2000, will face tighter controls under the House's new Republican domination.\n\nThe Republicans' good fortunes in the House and White House would not extend to the Senate. Yet with reconciliation, Senate Republicans could cut taxes and spending.\n\nWith enhanced Republican influence on appropriations and on legislation regarding regulations, union rules and education bureaucracies, Democrats will soon become the Senate's most fervent supporters of the legislative filibuster.\n\nThe Founding Fathers deserve credit for this looming transformation -- along with Gresham's law, the economic principle that \"bad money drives out good.\"\n\nThe Constitution's 10th Amendment, declaring that all powers not specifically granted to the federal government are reserved for the states, made states the laboratories of American democracy.\n\nAmericans have been given a choice: between economic growth and opportunity in low-tax, low-spending states on the one hand, and expansive welfare benefits in high-tax, big-spending states on the other.",

Gavin Newsom cited Scripture as evidence the government should feed the hungry. (Credit: Handout)\n\nA coalition of 25 Democratic governors and attorneys general on Tuesday sued the Trump administration over its refusal to fund the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits during the ongoing government shutdown -- arguing that a suspension of the aid threatens to disproportionately harm millions of vulnerable and low-income Americans.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed in Massachusetts, asks a federal judge to force the U.S. Department of Agriculture to release a portion of the $9.2 billion in SNAP benefits allocated for the month of November.\n\nThe Trump administration said Friday that it would not use the Agriculture Department's roughly $5 billion contingency fund to cover the food stamp benefits provided by SNAP for the month of November. Instead, they said, the agency is planning to keep it on hand to respond to natural disasters.\n\nSENATE GOP DIVIDED AS MILLIONS RISK LOSING FOOD AID IN SHUTDOWN STANDOFF\n\nStates warned in the lawsuit Tuesday that halting the SNAP payments, even in the near-term, threatens disproportionate harm for the roughly 42 million Americans that currently receive SNAP aid beginning on Nov. 1, when the food assistance is slated to expire.\n\n\"Shutting off SNAP benefits will cause deterioration of public health and well-being,\" state leaders said in the lawsuit.\n\n\"Ultimately, states will bear costs associated with many of these harms,\" they added. \"The loss of SNAP benefits leads to food insecurity, hunger, and malnutrition, which are associated with numerous negative health outcomes in children, such as poor concentration, decreased cognitive function, fatigue, depression, and behavioral problems.\"\n\nNEW YORK ATTORNEY GENERAL LETITIA JAMES ENTERS PLEA IN FEDERAL MORTGAGE FRAUD CASE\n\nThe lawsuit was filed by a coalition of attorneys general and governors from Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, D.C., Hawaii, Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin.\n\nIn the near-term, the states asked U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani, the federal judge in Massachusetts assigned to the case, to order the Trump administration to release the USDA contingency funds to help ensure there is not a lapse in SNAP program benefits beginning Nov. 1.\n\nJudge Talwani will hear from both parties during an emergency status hearing Wednesday,during which she will weigh the states' request for an emergency order to force USDA to release a portion of its emergency funds to SNAP recipients.\n\nSCHUMER AGAIN BLOCKS GOP BID TO REOPEN GOVERNMENT AS AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS GO UNPAID\n\nThe USDA, for its part, has not yet shared details on the policy decision or decision not to funnel the contingency funds to SNAP beneficiaries.\n\nA note on its website states simply that, \"[T]he well has run dry.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"At this time, there will be no benefits issued November 01,\" the agency said.",

        "description": "Natallie Rocha reported from San Francisco and Kashmir Hill from New York.\n\nCharacter.AI said on Wednesday that it would bar people under 18 from using its chatbots starting late next month, in a sweeping move to address concerns over child safety.\n\nThe rule will take effect Nov. 25, the company said. To enforce it, Character.AI said, over the next month the company will identify which users are minors and put time limits on their use of the app. Once the measure begins, those users will not be able to converse with the company's chatbots.\n\n\"We're making a very bold step to say for teen users, chatbots are not the way for entertainment, but there are much better ways to serve them,\" Karandeep Anand, Character.AI's chief executive, said in an interview. He said the company also planned to establish an A.I. safety lab.\n\nThe moves follow mounting scrutiny over how chatbots sometimes called A.I. companions can affect users' mental health. Last year, Character.AI was sued by the family of Sewell Setzer III, a 14-year-old in Florida who killed himself after constantly texting and conversing with one of Character.AI's chatbots. His family accused the company of being responsible for his death.\n\nThe case became a lightning rod for how people can develop emotional attachments to chatbots, with potentially dangerous results. Character.AI has since faced other lawsuits over child safety. A.I. companies including the ChatGPT maker OpenAI have also come under scrutiny for their chatbots' effects on people -- especially youths -- if they have sexually explicit or toxic conversations.\n\nIn September, OpenAI said it planned to introduce features intended to make its chatbot safer, including parental controls. This month, Sam Altman, OpenAI's chief executive, posted on social media that the company had \"been able to mitigate the serious mental health issues\" and would relax some of its safety measures.\n\n(The New York Times has sued OpenAI and Microsoft, claiming copyright infringement of news content related to A.I. systems. The two companies have denied the suit's claims.)\n\nIn the wake of these cases, lawmakers and other officials have begun investigations and proposed or passed legislation aimed at protecting children from A.I. chatbots. On Tuesday, Senators Josh Hawley, Republican of Missouri, and Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, introduced a bill to bar A.I. companions for minors, among other safety measures.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom this month signed a California law that requires A.I. companies to have safety guardrails on chatbots. The law takes effect Jan. 1.\n\n\"The stories are mounting of what can go wrong,\" said Steve Padilla, a Democrat in California's State Senate, who had introduced the safety bill. \"It's important to put reasonable guardrails in place so that we protect people who are most vulnerable.\"\n\nMr. Anand of Character.AI did not address the lawsuits his company faces. He said the start-up wanted to set an example on safety for the industry \"to do far more than what the regulation might require.\"\n\nCharacter.AI was founded in 2021 by Noam Shazeer and Daniel De Freitas, two former Google engineers, and raised nearly $200 million from investors. Last year, Google agreed to pay about $3 billion to license Character.AI's technology, and Mr. Shazeer and Mr. De Freitas returned to Google.\n\nCharacter.AI allows people to create and share their own A.I. characters, such as custom anime avatars, and it markets the app as A.I. entertainment. Some personas can be designed to simulate girlfriends, boyfriends or other intimate relationships. Users pay a monthly subscription fee, starting at about $8, to chat with the companions. Until its recent concern about underage users, Character.AI did not verify ages when people signed up.\n\nLast year, researchers at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign analyzed thousands of posts and comments that young people had left in Reddit communities dedicated to A.I. chatbots, and interviewed teenagers who used Character.AI, as well as their parents. The researchers concluded that the A.I. platforms did not have sufficient child safety protections, and that parents did not fully understand the technology or its risks.\n\n\"We should pay as much attention as we would if they were chatting with strangers,\" said Yang Wang, one of the university's information science professors. \"We shouldn't discount the risks just because these are nonhuman bots.\"\n\nCharacter.AI has about 20 million monthly users, with less than 10 percent of them self-reporting as being under the age of 18, Mr. Anand said.\n\nUnder Character.AI's new policies, the company will immediately place a two-hour daily limit on users under the age of 18. Starting Nov. 25, those users cannot create or talk to chatbots, but can still read previous conversations. They can also generate A.I. videos and images through a structured menu of prompts, within certain safety limits, Mr. Anand said.\n\nHe said the company had enacted other safety measures in the past year, such as parental controls.\n\nGoing forward, it will use technology to detect underage users based on conversations and interactions on the platform, as well as information from any connected social media accounts, he said. If Character.AI thinks a user is under 18, the person will be notified to verify his or her age.\n\nDr. Nina Vasan, a psychiatrist and director of a mental health innovation lab at Stanford University that has done research on A.I. safety and children, said it was \"huge\" that a chatbot maker would bar minors from using its app. But she said the company should work with child psychologists and psychiatrists to understand how suddenly losing access to A.I. companions would affect young users.\n\n\"What I worry about is kids who have been using this for years and have become emotionally dependent on it,\" she said. \"Losing your friend on Thanksgiving Day is not good.\"",

        "description": "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy joins 'America Reports' to break down a fatal California crash, allegedly caused by an illegal immigrant, and how the suspect was able to obtain a driver's license.\n\nFormer acting U.S. attorney in Sacramento Michele Beckwith, who was recently fired by the Trump administration, has reportedly found a new gig with California Gov. Gavin Newsom's team.\n\nNewsom recently hired Beckwith to serve as deputy legal affairs secretary, putting her in a position to provide legal counsel to the governor and state agencies, according to The New York Times.\n\n\"Trump's loss is California's gain,\" Tara Gallegos, a Newsom spokesperson told the Times. She added that Beckwith \"brings to our office more than 20 years of legal experience and invaluable knowledge of the law.\"\n\n\"To me, it's not political -- it's existential for our country,\" Beckwith said in an interview with the Times. \"So if there's something I can do to assist in keeping our democracy and Constitution alive, that is what I am happy to do.\"\n\nWHISTLEBLOWER WARNS ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS ARE SENDING 'SHOCKWAVE' THROUGH CRUCIAL INDUSTRY\n\nBeckwith was fired by the Trump administration after she clashed with Greg Bovino, chief of the Border Control sector in El Centro, Calif., over a court order on immigration arrests.\n\nOn July 15, Beckwith was fired just hours after telling Bovino that a court order prevented him from carrying out arrests in a region stretching from the Oregon border to Bakersfield, Calif., without reasonable suspicion of federal law violations, the Times reported, citing documents it had reviewed. The outlet noted that within days of Beckwith's firing, Bovino led a raid on a Home Depot parking lot during which at least eight were arrested for being in the U.S. illegally.\n\nAfter Beckwith's firing, Newsom's press office wrote on X, \"Trump has fired the top federal prosecutor in Sacramento because she insisted on following the law. WAKE UP, AMERICA. DEMOCRACY IS ON THE BRINK!\"\n\nARCHITECT OF LA ICE RAIDS REPORTEDLY ARRIVES IN CHICAGO AS FOCUS SHIFTS TO WINDY CITY, AGENT'S HISTORY\n\nThe firing occurred amid an ongoing feud between Newsom and President Donald Trump. The two have clashed over several issues, including immigration. Recently, Trump's Department of Transportation (DOT) announced it would be withholding $40 million in funding for California after it found that the Golden State was not complying with the DOT's English Language Proficiency (ELP) standards.\n\n\"I put states on notice this summer: enforce the Trump Administration's English language requirements or the checks stop coming. California is the only state in the nation that refuses to ensure big rig drivers can read our road signs and communicate with law enforcement. This is a fundamental safety issue that impacts you and your family on America's roads,\" Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a statement.\n\nCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nRecently, multiple deadly truck crashes have been linked to illegal immigrants who obtained commercial driver's licenses (CDLs) from California.\n\nThat includes a recent crash allegedly caused by Jashanpreet Singh, who is accused of driving under the influence and killing three people in the accident. On Oct. 23, the White House confirmed that Singh received his CDL from California.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that the DOT was cracking down on the issuing of CDLs amid a \"disturbing pattern\" of them being given to illegal immigrants.\n\nFox News Digital reached out to the White House, Newsom's office and the Department of Justice for comment.",

        "title": "Newsom thinks he can be president, but California's policies are killing people | Opinion",
        "description": "Former Vice President Kamala Harris and California Governor Gavin Newsom said they are considering 2028 presidential runs.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom finally admitted to what has been extremely obvious for some time: The Democrat wants to be president and is giving \"serious thought\" to a run for the White House in 2028.\n\n\"I'd be lying otherwise,\" Newsom said Oct. 26 on \"CBS News Sunday Morning.\" \"I'd just be lying. And I'm not - I can't do that.\"\n\nNewsom has made pushing back against President Donald Trump a top priority, and he's even taken to mimicking Trump's brash social media style.\n\nNewsom wants to be noticed.\n\nWhile the blue-state governor may have the looks and the charm, his record speaks loudly to why he shouldn't get America's top political job.\n\nCalifornia is indeed the poster child for liberal policies that do not work, and Newsom has been their biggest backer. From a $20 minimum wage for fast-food workers to costly government programs that are bankrupting the state, the list is long as to why California-style governing is the last thing this country needs.\n\nI want to focus on just one of the glaring problems.\n\nCalifornia keeps allowing illegal immigrants to get driver's licenses\n\nTwo recent deadly vehicle accidents make a strong case for why California's lax policies on illegal immigration are very wrong for the state - and would be for the country.\n\nCalifornia is already well-known for its \"sanctuary\" status, meaning it actively works against federal immigration laws. The state offers driver's licenses to illegal immigrants, too, among other benefits typically reserved for citizens and other legal residents.\n\nOn Oct. 21, three innocent people were killed - and several others were injured - by 21-year-old Jashanpreet Singh, who was driving a semi-truck on a California highway.\n\nHarrowing dash-cam footage of the accident makes it appear that Singh never even hit the brakes before obliterating the vehicles in front of him.\n\nSingh, who is from India, has been charged with vehicular manslaughter with gross negligence for driving under the influence and causing injury.\n\nHe was also in the country illegally, released at the southern border in 2022 under former President Joe Biden's watch. Shortly following the accident, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement lodged an arrest detainer for Singh.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed in a briefing on Oct. 23 that California issued Singh the commercial driver's license. Newsom has countered that the federal government had previously issued and renewed Singh's employment authorization needed to obtain a commercial license. But it was still California's decision to give him the license.\n\n\"This is a heinous tragedy that took three lives and severely injured others,\" said San Bernardino County District Attorney Jason Anderson in a statement. \"Frankly, it was easily avoidable if the defendant was not driving in a grossly negligent manner and impaired. Had the rule of law been followed by State and Federal officials the defendant should have never been in California at all.\"\n\nIndeed.\n\nTrump is fighting against open borders and failed policies\n\nIt's not the first time California policies that grant illegal immigrants driver's licenses have been linked to a fatal accident.\n\nIn August, another foreign truck driver caused a deadly collision in Florida that killed three people. The driver, also from India, was charged with three counts of vehicular homicide and had entered the country illegally via Mexico in 2018, according to the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles.\n\nThe driver allegedly did not speak English and had been issued a non-domiciled commercial driver's license by California in 2024. He'd previously been issued a CDL by Washington state, even though he'd failed the test 10 times prior to receiving it, according to Fox News.\n\nIn light of the August accident, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy had already taken action to tighten rules for who can get commercial licenses. On Oct. 15, he said the Transportation Department would withhold $40 million from California after an investigation found it was the only state not enforcing English language requirements for truckers.\n\nDuffy was clearly upset by the latest deadly crash in California.\n\n\"This is exactly why I set new restrictions that prohibit ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS from operating trucks,\" he said via social media on Oct 23.\n\nUnder the Trump administration, Biden's open border has effectively been closed and many of these other dangerous policies are being quashed.\n\nThe last thing we need is for Newsom to make the rest of the country look more like California.\n\nIngrid Jacques is a columnist at USA TODAY.

        "title": "In a California GOP stronghold, voters are not happy with Newsom's plan to help Democrats",
        "description": "REDDING, Calif. -- In a stretch of Northern California known for farming, ranching and a rural way of life, residents worry a ballot measure to redraw U.S. House maps is all but certain to dilute what little political power they possess in the heavily Democratic state.\n\nIf Proposition 50 passes, voters in three northern counties that went strongly for President Donald Trump in the last three elections would share a representative with some of the state's wealthiest and most liberal coastal communities. Rural voters would be outnumbered, making it unlikely for a Republican candidate to prevail.\n\n\"Most of us see it as, you know, just massive gerrymandering, taking what little representation that we had away and now we'll have absolutely nothing,\" Patrick Jones, a former Shasta County supervisor, said in a recent interview in his family's gun shop.\n\nVoting concludes Nov. 4 on the measure, which would create partisan U.S. House maps outside of normal once-a-decade redistricting handled by an independent commission. It's an effort by Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom to counter a Trump-backed plan in Texas to gain five more Republican seats. He says it's necessary to defend democracy, but California Republicans call it a power grab that will disenfranchise voters. Republicans currently hold nine of the state's 52 congressional seats.\n\nIn Redding, one of the largest cities north of Sacramento, bright yellow signs urging residents to defend fair elections and rural representation dot the highway. A local man recently led a one-person protest in front of City Hall, while more than 150 others showed up at a rally to reject what they see as a scheme by Democrats to take away their voices.\n\nBut they face an uphill battle in the state where registered Democrats outnumber Republicans by nearly 2-to-1. Democrats have returned nearly twice as many ballots. Labor unions and other Democratic allies have mobilized hundreds of volunteers to reach voters in solidly blue areas like Los Angeles with millions of voters. Two weeks before Election Day, just about 7,000 ballots had been returned in Shasta County, county clerk Clint Curtis said. He expects lower turnout than normal.\n\nTV advertising opposing the measure -- a key investment in the sprawling state -- has largely dried up. Some residents in Redding say they've heard little from Republican Rep. Doug LaMalfa about a plan to fight the measure, though he's scheduled an event Wednesday in another city in his district.\n\nUnder the new maps, voters in Shasta, Siskiyou and Modoc counties -- all conservative strongholds in the rural north -- would be in the same congressional district with Marin County, which sits just across the Golden Gate Bridge from San Francisco.\n\nLaMalfa's current district includes farms that grow rice, olive and other tree nuts, and ranching is prevalent in the farthest northern reaches. Lassen National Volcanic Park, historic Shasta Dam and snow-capped Mt. Shasta are defining features. Redding has a population under 100,000. Distrust of government and belief in election conspiracies are common. In 2024, 67% of voters in Shasta County supported Trump.\n\nMarin County, meanwhile, went 80% for Democrat Kamala Harris. The median household income tops $140,000 -- roughly double that of Shasta County. It's part of a district that runs north up the Pacific coastline to Oregon and is known for redwood forests, wine production and cannabis farms. It's represented by Democratic Rep. Jared Huffman.\n\nLaMalfa, a rice farmer, opposes the proposition and has spent at least $63,000 from his campaign fund to reach voters through text messages and yard signs. He also gave $50,000 to a statewide \"no\" campaign. Brenda Haynes, who works in LaMalfa's district office, said the congressman has joined residents waving flags on highway overpasses. His campaign declined a request for a reporter to shadow him on the trail.\n\n\"I think he's done phone calls and stuff, but I haven't really heard from him,\" said Toby Ruiz, a retired state worker who's lived in the area for most of his life.\n\nLaMalfa's supporters say they appreciate his conservative stances and push for an important new water storage project.\n\n\"I pretty much love the guy,\" said Bob Braz, a Redding area native who owns a bait shop. \"I stand for almost all the things that he's done.\"\n\nThose who don't know much about LaMalfa's record said they trust him because of his background.\n\n\"I don't hear much about him but he's a farmer,\" said Liz Jacobs, who moved from the Bay Area to Redding 20 years ago. She added: \"I don't know about somebody from the Bay Area with their progressive ideas.\"\n\nNewsom and other Democrats say the measure is a tool to fight Trump's agenda and counter Republican efforts to pickup seats elsewhere. Even if it passes and Democrats win five more seats, it may not help the party retain the House. Republicans in Missouri, North Carolina and Indiana are joining Texas in trying to draw more winnable seats in the 2026 midterms. Lawmakers in Virginia, meanwhile, are back in session to work on a map more friendly to Democrats. All of the efforts are sure to face legal challenges.\n\n\"This is not the fight we want to fight. This was not our battle,\" Newsom said in a recent virtual campaign event. \"This is in reaction to something unprecedented that happened.\"\n\nBut voters in Redding see it as another way to silence their voices.\n\nThey have long felt neglected by the Democratic-controlled Legislature in Sacramento, which they blame for raising the cost of living and infringing on local control. Lawmakers, for example, banned counties from hand-counting ballots in most cases after Shasta County leaders voted to get rid of their vote-counting machines in 2023.\n\nSome said they worry that national Republicans won't put up a fight to hold the seats if the measure passes.\n\n\"You would have to spend a huge amount of money to reach your base,\" said Jones, the former county supervisor. \"And they're just simply not going to want to waste that amount of money because it would be better spent throughout the country elsewhere.\"\n\nNot all voters are dreading a change.\n\nWarren Swanson, a Redding resident of more than 40 years, called LaMalfa \"Do Nothing Doug.\" His wife, Tara Swanson, also voted \"yes\" on the measure, partly because it promises to give map-drawing power back to the independent commission after the 2030 Census.\n\n\"Do two wrongs make a right? It's a tough one for those of us who think along those lines,\" Tara Swanson said.\n\nSome liberal voters in Mt. Shasta in Siskiyou County are hoping to oust LaMalfa over his vote for Trump's sweeping tax and spending bill that will overhaul health care and food assistance programs. Mothers, families and older adults in town could go hungry because of changes to food assistance programs, said Colleen Shelly, a Mt. Shasta resident who works with the state food assistance program.\n\nBut the fight is far from over for Republican voters in California, said Walter Stephen Rubke, a 38-year-old who moved to Redding last year. Many young people are supporting conservatives, he said, and he expects continual resistance from GOP voters even if the measure passes.\n\n\"I see a hard path ahead,\" he said. \"But I feel confident. I feel hopeful.\"",

        "description": "CNN host Abby Phillip warned on Tuesday's \"The Breakfast Club\" that if former Vice President Kamala Harris runs for president again, her campaign will be haunted by the bridges she burned with her tell-all book.\n\nAs the Democratic Party still seeks a new leader to rally around since its defeat last November, many have speculated that Harris plans to run again. Harris and former President Biden's occasional public appearances have received mixed reception from their Democratic allies, who often argue their post-election comments are not helpful.\n\nHarris has caused a particularly salient stir with her tell-all book \"107 Days,\" sharing her whirlwind experience of campaigning after Biden stepped down from the ticket.\n\n\"I think that there are a lot of bridges that are burned here whether she wanted to or not. And I think it will be very difficult for her to mend those fences that she'll need in order to run if she does decide to run again. I think this book read kind of like somebody who was kind of done with it. So I will be interested to see if she decides to do it,\" Phillip said.\n\n\"I think that she still has to figure out how to tap into authenticity in how she presents herself to the public because this world is not getting more kind to politicians who cannot level with voters and cannot show up any and everywhere,\" she added.\n\nPhillip recalled a recent piece about New York City Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani about how politicians in the modern era are expected to speak well in everything from short soundbites to lengthy interviews.\n\n\"I think that she still has work to do in that respect, and maybe this book is the first kind of foray into that, because I read her last book, and the tone was completely different,\" Phillip said. \"This is a different kind of book, and it was an opening foray into her showing people more of herself, but she's going to have to catch up to the speed and the kind of realness of media and politics that will be the bar in 2028.\n\n\"Like in 2028, the bar is going to be, 'Are you a politician that can show up any and everywhere and authentically reach people?'\"\n\n\"I think she is still straddling the old world and the new world, and she's going to have to figure out which one she wants to be in,\" Phillip suggested.\n\nShe went on to warn that going forward, politicians need to be willing to take risks and do unscripted interviews with people who may be hostile, knowing some can be won over and some will not go well.\n\n\"I'm just telling you, it's that was not how they ran that last campaign,\" she said.\n\nRepresentatives for Harris didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe CNN host went on to contrast her with California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who she argued, demonstrated his ability to bring on conservatives to his podcast and endure criticism from his own side for doing so.\n\n\"You've got to prove to people that you can win the argument. And if you can't do that, it doesn't matter how polished you are, how experienced or knowledgeable you are. I think that's the baseline bar that you're going to have to cross for a lot of voters in this future media ecosystem,\" she said.",

        "description": "In a press event launching a lawsuit against the Trump administration over SNAP benefits Tuesday, Gov. Gavin Newsom cited Scripture as evidence the government should feed the hungry. (Credit: Handout)\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom invoked biblical teachings while criticizing Republican leadership and the Trump administration for the federal government shutdown's impact on food assistance, arguing that Scripture commands care for the hungry and that Washington is failing that moral test.\n\nSpeaking Tuesday in Sacramento alongside state Attorney General Rob Bonta and Health and Human Services Secretary Kim Johnson, Newsom cited teachings from Matthew, Isaiah, Luke and Proverbs as evidence that feeding the poor is \"core and central to what it is to align to God's will.\"\n\n\"It's not a suggestion in the Old [and] the New Testament,\" Newsom said. \"These guys need to stop the B.S. in Washington. They're sitting there in their prayer breakfasts. Maybe they got an edited version of [President] Donald Trump's Bible, and they edited all of that out. Cruelty is the policy.\"\n\nNEWSOM REBUKES WHITE HOUSE DEFENSE OF PRAYER AFTER SHOOTING: KIDS WERE 'LITERALLY PRAYING AS THEY GOT SHOT AT'\n\nNewsom, who was raised Catholic and graduated from Santa Clara University, a Jesuit institution, has occasionally cited his faith background and Jesuit education when discussing social issues.\n\nIn his remarks Tuesday, he referenced \"a wonderful Jesuit university\" and said lessons from the New Testament emphasize feeding the hungry and caring for the poor.\n\nNewsom's comments came as California and two dozen other states sued the Trump administration's U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) over its decision to suspend November Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits during the government shutdown.\n\nBonta said the agency has contingency funds and is allegedly \"unlawfully withholding payments.\"\n\nWhile Newsom tied the issue to Scripture, he recently came under fire for pushing against White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt's assertion of the power of prayer in the wake of the Annunciation Catholic Church shooting in August.\n\nUSDA CHIEF WARNS 'WE'RE RIGHT AT THE CLIFF' AS 40 MILLION AMERICANS BRACE FOR FOOD STAMP CUTOFF\n\n\"These children were literally praying as they got shot at,\" Newsom wrote above a clip of Leavitt promoting prayer.\n\nNewsom pressed the point repeatedly in his Tuesday remarks, saying leaders who cite religion should reflect those values in policy.\n\n\"We're going to win this lawsuit,\" he said. \"It's about serving those that are hungry.\"\n\nCalifornia officials said the state has accelerated $80 million to food banks and deployed volunteers and National Guard members to move supplies. Johnson said CalFresh serves 5.5 million residents monthly and warned that a lapse in SNAP benefits would increase poverty.\n\nNewsom closed his remarks by again linking government action to biblical duty. \"It's around food. It's about serving those that are hungry,\" he said.\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson pushed back sharply, accusing the governor of hypocrisy.\n\n\"It's preposterous that Newsom, who shuttered churches during COVID and recently derided the power of prayer, is now attempting to manipulate religion to fit his own political agenda,\" Jackson said in a statement to Fox News Digital.\n\n\"President Trump wants the government open -- the Democrats' insistence on keeping it shut down is hurting the American people, but they could prevent these harms by simply reopening the government. Instead of distorting religion for political means, Newsom should urge his fellow Democrats to reopen the government.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nOn Fox News' \"America Reports\" Tuesday, USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins blamed Democrats for refusing to vote on measures to reopen the government and restore SNAP funding.\n\n\"We are right at the cliff. And I've been warning about this for almost a month now, that we have enough money to get us through the end of October. But after that, the government has to reopen,\" Rollins said.\n\nThe USDA and Newsom's office did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's requests for comment.",

        "description": "Just one week out from California's Nov. 4 special election, Gov. Gavin Newsom is putting the brakes on some fundraising for Proposition 50, the Democrat-backed congressional redistricting measure.\n\nNewsom's unusual request to small donors of his Yes on 50 campaign comes after the governor said he's reached his fundraising goal for the measure. Newsom made the announcement during a press conference on Tuesday.\n\n\"It's the first time, I don't know, likely to be the last time I've ever said, 'stop, please don't send any more money,' \" Newsom said. \"I don't know many elected officials who've ever been able to lay claim to that.\"\n\nNewsom's Yes on 50 Ballot Measure Committee has already recieved contributions of $119 million as of October 28, according to the California Secretary of State website, which was updated on Tuesday.\n\nThat compares to a group of No on 50 campaign committees -- the Congressional Leadership Fund, Protect Voters First, Stop Sacramento's Power Grab, Voters Deserve Better -- that have amassed a combined $89 million in contributions as of the same date.\n\nThe Yes on 50 campaign has turned its money into ads framing the election as a President Trump versus California debate, while the No on 50 side has focused on the ideas of protecting the principle of independent redistricting.\n\nSteve Maviglio is a democratic strategist and frequent Newsom critic who says the yes campaign messaging is making a difference.\n\n\"Well, the yes side is all over the airwaves and social media,\" Maviglio said. \"And if you look at the early returns, more ballots are coming from Democrats than there are from Republicans, even by registration. So the yes side has done a very good job appealing to Democrats and making this a very partisan issue, which of course they can't lose in a state with so many Democrats.\"\n\nA recent CBS News poll shows 62% of likely voters will vote yes on Proposition 50.\n\nAccording to Political Data, Inc., so far, 21% of registered voters have cast their ballots in early voting, and twice the number of registered Democrats as Republicans have returned their ballots.",

        "title": "Newsom Hires US Attorney Fired by Trump",
        "description": "After President Trump fired the acting U.S. attorney in Sacramento, his California nemesis, Gov. Gavin Newsom, took notice.\n\nFirst, Mr. Newsom stuck up for the ousted prosecutor, Michele Beckwith, on X. \"WAKE UP, AMERICA,\" the governor's press office posted. \"DEMOCRACY IS ON THE BRINK!\" The post was accompanied by photos of Ms. Beckwith and Mr. Trump, his face half-hidden in shadows.\n\nNow, Mr. Newsom has hired Ms. Beckwith as a deputy legal affairs secretary. In government-speak, that means she is an attorney providing legal counsel to the governor and state agencies.\n\n\"Michele brings to our office more than 20 years of legal experience and invaluable knowledge of the law,\" said Tara Gallegos, a spokeswoman for Mr. Newsom. \"Trump's loss is California's gain.\"\n\nThe White House referred a request for comment on Ms. Beckwith's new role to the Department of Justice, which declined to comment on the matter.\n\nThe New York Times first reported last month that Ms. Beckwith had been quietly fired less than six hours after emailing Gregory Bovino, the Border Patrol chief based in Southern California, that he would have to abide by court orders and the Constitution while conducting a planned operation in her district.\n\nShe sent the email to Mr. Bovino on July 15 after he had notified her that he was headed to Sacramento for an immigration operation. She said she wanted to ensure he knew about court orders in her district requiring that Border Patrol agents could only detain people if they had a reasonable suspicion that those people were violating federal immigration law.\n\nThat afternoon, Ms. Beckwith received an email from the White House stating that her employment with the Department of Justice was terminated \"on behalf of President Donald J. Trump.\" Her phone and computer went dark, and she was marched out of the office.\n\nTwo days later, Mr. Bovino and his agents raided a Home Depot parking lot in Sacramento. He posted a video on X in which he said: \"Folks, there is no such thing as a sanctuary city. There is no such thing as a sanctuary state.\"\n\nMr. Bovino said in an emailed statement last month to The New York Times, \"The former Acting US Attorney's email suggesting that the United States Border Patrol does not ALWAYS abide by the Constitution revealed a bias against law enforcement.\"\n\nMr. Bovino's tactics have come under scrutiny in Chicago, where a federal judge admonished him on Tuesday after the agency apparently violated her orders restricting the use of force and tear gas.\n\nMs. Beckwith's firing was an early example of the president's ousting of top federal prosecutors who did not carry out his agenda. After firing her, he fired a U.S. attorney in Virginia who had determined there was not enough evidence to indict James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director, and Letitia James, the New York State attorney general, both of whom are political targets of the president. The replacement U.S. attorney later indicted both of them.\n\nThere are 93 U.S. attorneys who oversee federal prosecutions in districts around the country. Ms. Beckwith, a career prosecutor, had been working as the No. 2 attorney in the office when her boss, who had been appointed by the Biden administration, resigned shortly before Mr. Trump was inaugurated. She then kept doing her old job while filling in as acting U.S. attorney.\n\nMr. Trump not only removed her as acting U.S. attorney but also ended her career as a federal prosecutor, a move experts said was unusual.\n\nMs. Beckwith, who started her new job last week, said in an interview that she was still getting acclimated and was looking forward to \"a very interesting year.\"\n\n\"To me, it's not political -- it's existential for our country,\" she said. \"So if there's something I can do to assist in keeping our democracy and Constitution alive, that is what I am happy to do.\"",

        "description": "Florida Governor Ron DeSantis weighs in on the petition in support of the illegal alien trucker accused of killing three and California Governor Gavin Newsom's 'tough guy' act on 'Hannity.'\n\nFlorida on Tuesday carried out its 15th execution of the year -- a record under Gov. Ron DeSantis -- putting to death Norman Mearle Grim Jr., who was convicted of raping and murdering his neighbor more than two decades ago.\n\nA spokesperson for Desantis confirmed 65-year-old Grim was pronounced dead at 6:14 p.m. after receiving a three-drug injection at the Florida State Prison near Starke, according to The Associated Press.\n\nThe spokesperson, Alex Lanfranconi, noted that Grim was asked if he had a final statement before receiving the injection, and he replied, \"No sir.\"\n\nLanfranconi also said there were no complications during the execution.\n\nFLORIDA CONTINUES TO EXTEND RECORD EXECUTION YEAR WITH MAN PUT TO DEATH FOR KILLING WIFE'S FAMILY\n\nGrim was sentenced to death after being convicted of sexual battery and first-degree murder in the death of Cynthia Campbell. The victim was reported missing in July 1998 and her body, which was battered, was found by a fisherman in the water near the Pensacola Bay Bridge.\n\nProsecutors made the case that Campbell suffered multiple blunt-force injuries to her face and head, consistent with those of being struck by a hammer. She also had 11 stab wounds in the chest.\n\nWhen an autopsy was conducted on Campbell, it was discovered that seven of the 11 stab wounds penetrated her heart. Physical evidence, including DNA, tied Grim to Campbell's murder.\n\nFLORIDA BREAKS 50-YEAR EXECUTION RECORD WITH NINTH DEATH SENTENCE CARRIED OUT THIS YEAR\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in 1976, and since then, the highest previous annual total of executions in Florida was set at eight in 2014.\n\nThis year, though, Florida has executed more people than any other state, followed by Texas and Alabama with five each.\n\nGrim waived any appeal to his conviction earlier this month, despite being given a last chance to make an appeal to the Florida Supreme Court and U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nFLORIDA EXTENDS RECORD EXECUTIONS WITH DATE SET FOR MAN WHO FATALLY STABBED COUPLE DURING ROBBERY\n\nWhen he woke up at 6 a.m. on Tuesday, Grim had fried pork chops and mashed potatoes with a chocolate milkshake, the Department of Corrections told The AP. The spokesperson said Grim did not have any visitors, nor did he meet with a spiritual advisor before the execution.\n\nTwo more executions are planned next month in Florida.\n\nBryan Fredrick Jennings, 66, is scheduled for the state's 16th execution on Nov. 13. He was convicted of raping and killing a 6-year-old girl in 1979 after entering through a window and abducting her from her central Florida home.\n\nRichard Barry Randolph, 63, is set for Florida's 17th execution on Nov. 20. He was convicted of the 1988 rape and fatal beating of his former manager at a Florida convenience store.\n\nCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nFlorida's lethal injections are carried out with a sedative, a paralytic and a drug that stops the heart, according to the state Department of Corrections.",

        "title": "CNN anchor warns Harris will struggle with 'authenticity,' burned bridges if she runs again",
        "description": "CNN host Abby Phillip warned that former Vice President Kamala Harris faces an uphill battle if she runs again, ranging from the burned bridges after her tell-all book to the changing media landscape that demands authenticity and risk taking.\n\nCNN host Abby Phillip warned on Tuesday's \"The Breakfast Club\" that if former Vice President Kamala Harris runs for president again, her campaign will be haunted by the bridges she burned with her tell-all book.\n\nAs the Democratic Party still seeks a new leader to rally around since its defeat last November, many have speculated that Harris plans to run again. Harris and former President Biden's occasional public appearances have received mixed reception from their Democratic allies, who often argue their post-election comments are not helpful.\n\nHarris has caused a particularly salient stir with her tell-all book \"107 Days,\" sharing her whirlwind experience of campaigning after Biden stepped down from the ticket.\n\n\"I think that there are a lot of bridges that are burned here whether she wanted to or not. And I think it will be very difficult for her to mend those fences that she'll need in order to run if she does decide to run again. I think this book read kind of like somebody who was kind of done with it. So I will be interested to see if she decides to do it,\" Phillip said.\n\nWASHINGTON POST SLAMS KAMALA HARRIS BOOK TOUR, SAYS DEMS DON'T 'HAVE TIME TO WASTE' ON FORMER VP\n\n\"I think that she still has to figure out how to tap into authenticity in how she presents herself to the public because this world is not getting more kind to politicians who cannot level with voters and cannot show up any and everywhere,\" she added.\n\nPhillip recalled a recent piece about New York City Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani about how politicians in the modern era are expected to speak well in everything from short soundbites to lengthy interviews.\n\n\"I think that she still has work to do in that respect, and maybe this book is the first kind of foray into that, because I read her last book, and the tone was completely different,\" Phillip said. \"This is a different kind of book, and it was an opening foray into her showing people more of herself, but she's going to have to catch up to the speed and the kind of realness of media and politics that will be the bar in 2028. Like in 2028, the bar is going to be, 'Are you a politician that can show up any and everywhere and authentically reach people?'\"\n\n\"I think she is still straddling the old world and the new world, and she's going to have to figure out which one she wants to be in,\" Phillip suggested.\n\nFROM TELL ALL TO END ALL: FORMER VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS' 5 BIG CAREER MISTAKES\n\nShe went on to warn that going forward, politicians need to be willing to take risks and do unscripted interviews with people who may be hostile, knowing some can be won over and some will not go well.\n\n\"I'm just telling you, it's that was not how they ran that last campaign,\" she said.\n\nRepresentatives for Harris didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe CNN host went on to contrast her with California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who she argued, demonstrated his ability to bring on conservatives to his podcast and endure criticism from his own side for doing so.\n\n\"You've got to prove to people that you can win the argument. And if you can't do that, it doesn't matter how polished you are, how experienced or knowledgeable you are. I think that's the baseline bar that you're going to have to cross for a lot of voters in this future media ecosystem,\" she said.",

        "title": "Yosemite rangers bust outlaw jumpers off El Cap  --  zero tolerance, shutdown or not",
        "description": "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.\n\nThe National Park Service (NPS) announced that three people have been convicted of illegal BASE jumping in a national park, as the agency warns would-be outlaws it's still enforcing the law despite the federal shutdown.\n\n\"We do not tolerate illegal activity in Yosemite National Park,\" Yosemite Superintendent Raymond McPadden said. \"Our law enforcement rangers remain efficient, effective and vigilant 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. These convictions demonstrate the professionalism and dedication of Yosemite's protection team in upholding federal regulations and ensuring the safety of both visitors and first responders.\"\n\nThough Yosemite was once a hub for the sport in the 1970s, BASE jumping has been banned in national parks since the 1980s. The activity, an acronym for Building, Antenna, Span and Earth, involves jumping from fixed objects with a parachute. It has been linked to numerous injuries, fatalities and risky rescue operations, endangering both jumpers and emergency personnel.\n\nViolators can face fines up to $5,000 or jail time under federal law. Offenders also risk losing their equipment and can be banned from park lands. Despite the ban, enthusiasts have continued to jump in secret, often at dawn or dusk to avoid detection.\n\nSQUATTERS TAKE OVER YOSEMITE AS SHUTDOWN LEAVES POPULAR NATIONAL PARK WITH FEW RANGERS: REPORT\n\nIn recent weeks, several videos and images circulating on social media appear to show BASE jumpers leaping from El Capitan, unauthorized campers occupying closed areas and climbers scaling Half Dome's cables without permits -- all in violation of park regulations.\n\nWhile the number of federal employees currently working at Yosemite during the government shutdown remains unclear, the NPS contingency plan states that essential staff will continue duties related to law enforcement and emergency response.\n\nThe Department of the Interior (DOI), which oversees the NPS, told Fox News Digital it is aware of reports of illegal activity and is investigating.\n\n\"We are aware of reports of BASE jumping in Yosemite and investigate all reports,\" a department spokesperson said. \"BASE jumping is illegal in all national parks, including Yosemite, due to the significant safety risks it poses to participants, the public and first responders.\"\n\nThe department emphasized that, despite the shutdown, the National Park Service will continue to keep parks as accessible as possible during the lapse in appropriations.\n\nTHOUSANDS OF ILLEGAL HIDDEN MARIJUANA PLANTS REMOVED FROM NATIONAL PARK ALONG WITH GUN, DANGEROUS CHEMICALS\n\n\"Critical functions that protect life, property and public health will remain in place, including visitor access in many locations, law enforcement and emergency response,\" the spokesperson said. \"We have 100% of our law enforcement rangers on duty. They are highly trained and, as in any other year at this time, are handling both front-country and backcountry patrols as needed.\"\n\nThe DOI said Yosemite continues to see normal seasonal visitation levels and that law enforcement rangers are responding to incidents as they normally would. Since the start of the shutdown, there have been three reported and documented BASE jumping complaints, which remain under active investigation.\n\nThe department also noted that the use of unmanned aircraft, or drones, is prohibited in Yosemite without a special permit. Violations can result in fines of up to $5,000 or six months in jail.\n\nOfficials said drone violations have increased in recent years, driven by the availability of consumer models. In response, Yosemite has expanded signage at entrances and visitor areas to remind the public of these restrictions. During the current shutdown, there have been sporadic reports of unauthorized drone use, and law enforcement rangers are responding as normal.\n\nThe DOI disputed some recent claims circulating online about deteriorating park conditions.\n\nYOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK RANGER REPORTEDLY FIRED AFTER DRAPING MASSIVE TRANS PRIDE FLAG ACROSS EL CAPITAN\n\n\"Our on-the-ground teams confirm that these reports do not accurately reflect current operations or visitor conditions,\" the spokesperson said. \"There has been no increase in vandalism, trash buildup or visitor misconduct unique to the shutdown period. Visitor cooperation and volunteer stewardship remain strong, and we appreciate the public's continued care for these sites.\"\n\nThe department added that it is \"proud of the dedicated employees and partners who continue to serve the public during this challenging time,\" and said teams are \"working hard to keep parks accessible, safe and welcoming.\"\n\n\"Like many across the federal government, we look forward to a resolution that allows all staff to return to work supporting the park's mission,\" the statement added.\n\nThe latest convictions, which were announced on Friday, stem from three separate cases between 2020 and 2024, including one involving a serious injury.\n\nThis was Nunn's second conviction for illegal BASE jumping; he previously pleaded guilty to a similar offense in 1998.\n\nINTERIOR DEPARTMENT ADOPTS NO-TOLERANCE POLICY FOR HOMELESS ENCAMPMENTS IN WASHINGTON, DC\n\nConservation advocates say the incidents reflect a larger pattern of disorder that can arise when national parks operate without full staffing.\n\nDuring the 2018-2019 shutdown, Yosemite and other parks suffered vandalism, illegal off-roading and waste accumulation that took months to repair, according to park advocates.\n\n\"This is exactly what we warned about. And this is why national parks need to be closed until the government re-opens,\" Emily Thompson, executive director of the Coalition to Protect America's National Parks, said in a previous statement. \"This shutdown is making an already bad situation at national parks and public lands far worse. The situation is dangerous and reckless for our parks, public lands and the visitors who love them.\"\n\nThe coalition, made up of more than 40 former NPS leaders, has urged Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to close all 433 park sites during any lapse in federal funding, citing ongoing staffing shortages.\n\nCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"Leaving national parks open without National Park staff to help protect visitors and resources is not only irresponsible -- it's dangerous. We don't leave museums open without curators, or airports without air traffic controllers and we should not leave our National Parks open without NPS employees,\" Thompson wrote.\n\nYosemite typically welcomes about four million visitors each year, with roughly three-quarters arriving between May and October, according to the National Park Service. During the current funding lapse, the Interior Department's contingency plan says parks will offer only basic services using retained recreation fees, while law enforcement and emergency operations continue.\"\n\nFox News Digital reached out to California Gov. Gavin Newsom's office for comment about the convictions.",

        "description": "California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom said he is \"deeply concerned\" about remarks from President Donald Trump and his close allies about possibly seeking a third term in 2028.\n\nNewsom, who is considered a potential 2028 presidential contender himself, was asked by ABC News Chief Washington Correspondent Jonathan Karl if he takes such talk seriously.\n\n\"They're not screwing around,\" Newsom said.\n\nWatch ABC News Chief Washington Correspondent Jonathan Karl's interview with California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Wednesday at 8:30 p.m. ET on ABC News Live and streaming on Disney+ and Hulu.\n\nTrump has mused several times about running for president again, including as recently as Monday, when he told reporters on Air Force One that he would \"love to do it\" despite it being barred by the Constitution.\n\nThe 22nd Amendment expressly forbids a president from being elected to office more than twice.\n\nLast week, Steve Bannon, the former Trump White House adviser and conservative media provocateur, said in an interview with The Economist that \"there's a plan\" and Trump \"is going to get a third term\" though he didn't share any details.\n\nHere's a transcript of the exchange between Newsom and Karl in the interview that will air on Wednesday in which Newsom talks about his meeting with Trump in the Oval Office in February.\n\nKARL: \"Bannon is talking Trump running again 2028 and you said Trump was talking about his fourth term?\"\n\nNEWSOM: \"He was showing me a photo of -- I turned around, he was at the Resolute [Desk], and he goes, 'Look over there.' I'm like, and I literally looked and I looked him. I'm like, 'OK.' I said, 'Third term?' He goes, 'No, fourth.' And it was FDR's painting up on the wall. I'm like, here we go. I said, 'We're perfect little sheep, aren't we?' He's laughing because we are. He knows exactly what we're going to do. There's a French, I don't know what the, I can't say it in French -- poem that loosely says, 'He pisses on the grasshoppers to hear them sing.' And that's Donald Trump.\"\n\nKARL: \"So do you take that seriously? Do you think he is going to try to stay in office?\"\n\nNEWSOM: \"What I've noticed, what we all have experienced, I hope we're absorbing in our souls, because we're talking about the soul of America, is, I don't think he takes himself seriously, but he iterates. He throws things out. And he plays with it, and he sees how people react, and it manifests. Meaning, once a mind is stretched, it never goes back to its original form. And that's my concern. The more we're talking about this -- and we need to be. Look at what he's doing with masked agents. Look what he's doing federalizing the Guard. Look what he's doing to intimidate and voter suppression. Look what he's going to do with the DOJ. Look what he's trying to do to rig the elections: North Carolina, Missouri, down there, next Florida, not just in Texas. Look what he's doing in terms of the $230 million that is, apparently, his from his DOJ. All the pardoning, all the this -- this great grift, the biggest, most corrupt administration in history. Not just the $400 million plane, but the billion dollars of your tax money as we're cutting food stamps to pay for the damn plane so he can take that toy home with his foundation when he's 93 or whatever he's done with his fourth or fifth term.

        "title": "Off-duty cop ends 150 mph chase for California biker accused of killing sheriff's deputy",
        "description": "An off-duty law enforcement officer jumped into action Monday by ramming into a fleeing motorcyclist after the biker was accused of fatally shooting a San Bernardino County Sheriff's deputy, authorities said.\n\nSan Bernardino County Sheriff Shannon D. Dicas said the off-duty narcotics officer struck the suspect following the deadly encounter Monday afternoon that killed Deputy Andrew Nunez.\n\nThe sheriff said Deputy Nunez, 28, was shot in the head moments after arriving at a Rancho Cucamonga home where a man threatened a woman at gunpoint. The deputy later died in a hospital.\n\nThe suspect, whom police have not identified, then hopped on a motorcycle and raced away from the scene.\n\nThe biker accelerated to well over 150 mph on Interstate 210 and weaved between cars as he eluded California Highway Patrol troopers and sheriff's deputies in hot pursuit.\n\nNews crews documenting the chase from a helicopter showed the suspect zooming along the left shoulder when the off-duty officer veered into his path.\n\n\"The pursuit came to a conclusion with an off-duty deputy sheriff who put himself on duty and conducted a legal intervention by hitting the suspect on the motorcycle,\" Sheriff Dicus said.\n\nThe collision launched the suspect from his motorcycle and caused him to tumble several feet along the highway pavement.\n\nPolice vehicles swarmed the downed suspect within seconds, as officers ran to handcuff the man linked to Deputy Nunez's killing.\n\nThe suspect was eventually seen on a gurney with a neck brace. He was airlifted to a hospital with unknown injuries.\n\nAuthorities said the suspect is expected to face suspicion of murder charges once he's out of the hospital's care.\n\nSheriff Dicus said Deputy Nunez, a six-year veteran of the force, leaves behind his pregnant wife and a 2-year-old daughter.\n\n\"On behalf of all Californians, Jennifer and I extend our deepest condolences to the family, friends and colleagues of Deputy Nunez,\" Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a statement. \"His courage, compassion and dedication to protecting others reflect the finest traditions of law enforcement. We honor his life and service with gratitude; may his sacrifice never be forgotten.\"\n\nMr. Newsom ordered flags at the state capitol in Sacramento to be flown at half-staff in remembrance of the slain deputy.",

        "description": "\"Don't just hand it over to Kamala Harris. They had a pact on this,\" the ABC News journalist shares\n\nABC News correspondent Jonathan Karl detailed a fiery phone call between former President Barack Obama and Rep. Nancy Pelosi after she broke an agreement the pair had by quickly endorsing former Vice President Kamala Harris for the 2024 presidential race following Joe Biden's withdrawal.\n\nThe ABC News correspondent appeared as a guest on \"Morning Joe\" Tuesday to share revelations he included in his forthcoming book \"Retribution\" about the 2024 presidential election, how it altered the course of history and how Harris' nomination caused a schism between Obama and Pelosi.\n\n\"The two of them had been basically working to try to get Biden out of the race,\" Karl explained. \"And they had been adamant that when he gets out, we need to have some kind of a process, whether it be a mini flash primary ... a meeting of delegates, something, ... don't just hand it over to Kamala Harris. They had a pact on this.\"\n\nHe continued, saying that once Harris announced her run, everyone flooded the internet with their support.\n\n\"She gets out, and everyone endorses her within hours ... [Josh] Shapiro, Gavin Newsom, they're all endorsing her within hours,\" Karl said.\n\nHe went on to say that while everyone jumped on the Harris train immediately, Pelosi at least waited until the next day, but by that point Pelosi saw that there was \"nothing to hold the tide.\"\n\n\"So she puts out the endorsement,\" Karl explained, adding that's when Pelosi got a phone call from Obama. Karl said he spoke with someone who heard the actual phone conversation between Obama and Pelosi.\n\n\"And what Obama says is basically, 'Nancy, what was that all about?' And clearly [he's] irritated,\" Karl said.\n\nKarl mentioned that he's discussed the contents of the phone call with \"people close to\" Obama, who told him that Obama was merely \"joshing with her and giving her a hard time.\"\n\nHowever, he added that when he chatted with one of Pelosi's close associates, they shared that he was actually \"pissed off.\"\n\n\"He was angry,\" Karl said. \"The clear message was, 'Why did you do that?'\"\n\nAs he closed up the conversation, saying even that Pelosi's husband, Paul Pelosi, was also taken aback by his wife's move.\n\n\"I also report that, at right about the same time, Pelosi talks to her husband, Paul Pelosi, and Paul answers the phone by saying, 'Kamala? You did what?'\" Karl shared. \"There were doubts from both of them, obviously, that she was the strongest candidate. But bigger than that, they thought that it would be [a] very bad look and not good for her campaign if she was just ordained.\"\n\nYou can watch Karl's full \"Morning Joe\" appearance in the video above.",

        "description": "If the 2028 presidential election were held today, JD Vance and Pete Buttigieg would be on the ballot.\n\nThat's according to the latest \"Granite State Poll\" out of the University of New Hampshire's political center, where Vice President Vance received 51% of his party's vote and former Transportation Secretary Buttigieg 19% from the Democratic side.\n\n\"It's basically name recognition now,\" said Andy Smith, UNH professor and director of polling. \"It's just a snapshot of the early front-runners.\"\n\nBut, he told the Herald Tuesday, whoever shows the strongest in New Hampshire usually wins the state and the party's nomination -- that's especially true for Republican candidates.\n\nVice President Vance is in \"a solid position,\" said Smith, yet so many factors are yet to come into focus as President Donald Trump's administration works on multiple fronts, from the tariffs to illegal immigration, the shutdown and the deficit to Ukraine, Gaza and drug runners out of Central and South America.\n\nOther factors at play for the Democrats, Smith stressed, are the \"generational change\" within the party. Younger voters, 20 to 40 years old, identify as \"socialists,\" Dems 40-plus are more \"progressives,\" with 60 and over saying they are \"liberal.\"\n\nThat's where the race for the Democratic nomination will come down to, with California Gov. Gavin Newsom with 15%, New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez with 14%, former VP Kamala Harris 11%, with Vermont independent Sen. Bernie Sanders, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker and Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear all in single digits with 8%, 6%, and 3%, respectively. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and ESPN yakker Stephen A. Smith are clinging to 1% or under.\n\nOn the GOP side, no one is even close to Vance. Former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley is at 9%, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard 8%, and U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio 5%. Yet, Rubio's favorability rating is second only to Vance's at 58%. The VP clocks in at 77%.\n\nOn the Democratic side, Buttigieg's favorability rating is a strong 81%, but so too is Sanders, who is a solid 72% in the blue. AOC is at 66% beating Newsom's 58% easily. Harris comes in a distant eighth at a modest 55% favorability.\n\nThe poll was released Monday and has a sampling error rate of roughly 2.5%. The poll was taken online and via text between Oct. 16-21. The survey was evenly split between men and women, with 1,547 NH residents completing the questionnaire.\n\nThe Granite State still prides itself as home to the first presidential primary in the nation, which has come under attack. The Democratic National Committee's Rules and Bylaws Committee is taking that very matter into consideration with a decision due this winter.",

        "title": "J. B. Pritzker Wishes for Precedented Times",
        "description": "Twenty-seven minutes with the latest governor Donald Trump wants arrested\n\nIllinois Governor J. B. Pritzker has said that he lives \"rent-free\" in Donald Trump's head. He also lives part-time in the official governor's mansion in Springfield.\n\n\"It's the largest governor's mansion in the country,\" Pritzker told me when I met him in Chicago late Friday afternoon. His wife, M. K. Pritzker, oversaw a major redecoration of the 16-room, Italian-style manor after her husband was first elected, in 2018. The governor raves about the job she did.\n\nBut does it have a ballroom? I asked.\n\nPritzker declared this to be a \"funny question.\" No, he told me, although there is a \"large gathering place.\"\n\n\"Do we call it the ballroom?\" he wondered, in the general direction of an aide. She shrugged. (They do.)\n\nPritzker and I were tucked away in a hybrid conference/break room that was definitely not a ballroom. My opening question felt timely, given that Pritzker's main political nemesis of late has embarked on building a ballroom at his own official residence, a process that began with the shocking demolition of the White House's East Wing.\n\nIn the scheme of things, this landmark leveling was a small, if highly symbolic, step on the path of havoc that Trump has blazed across much of the federal government and blue America. Chicago and Pritzker have figured prominently as targets. Last month, ICE and Customs and Border Protection officers surged into the greater metropolitan area, engaging in conspicuous raids and stopping people \"because of their brown skin,\" in the governor's words. The agents were acting at the behest of Trump, who is also trying to send National Guard troops into what he has called the \"most dangerous city in the world.\" A judge has blocked the deployment until the legality of Trump's order is settled in court.\n\nRead: Democrats bet on a billionaire in Illinois\n\nPritzker is currently a focal-point Democratic leader against the activist aggressions of the White House. One could make a case that a state-versus-federal discord of this magnitude has not existed since the civil-rights movement, or even the Civil War era. Throughout our conversation, the governor seemed to project disbelief, bewilderment, a sense of Are you kidding me? over what have now become commonplace parts of his job -- asking citizens to film federal officers acting improperly, volleying daily insults with the president, even suggesting that the nation's commander in chief is \"suffering dementia.\"\n\nWhile the Guardsmen's status remains in limbo, Pritzker has remained in constant action, and in constant demand. Events have been whipping fast around the chief executive, who has been popping up everywhere -- in person and on TV screens, often in the midst of chaotic police or press scrums. Corralling the governor for an interview took me three weeks. He granted me 27 minutes of his time.\n\nWhen we spoke, Pritzker had just finished a ceremony to mark the reopening of the Kennedy Expressway, which connects downtown Chicago and O'Hare International Airport, following the completion of a three-year, $169 million rehabilitation project. It was a gorgeous fall afternoon in the windy \"war zone\" (Trump's words), with sun sparkling off of the skyscrapers and Lake Michigan packed with sailboats. The only real hazard I encountered during my day in the city involved dodging bikes, scooters, and jogger-strollers on Michigan Avenue and Lake Shore Drive. I witnessed none of the \"ongoing violent riots and lawlessness\" (the White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson's words) that the president apparently believes to be the defining characteristics of America's third-most-populous city.\n\nI suggested to Pritzker that these must be unprecedented times for him. He disputed this, and said that he has become well accustomed to unprecedented times. In fact, he maintained that since he was elected governor, he has enjoyed only about eight months of \"precedented times\" -- a stretch in 2019 and early 2020, before COVID. \"Then, the migrant crisis, which was started right, basically, as COVID was waning,\" Pritzker told me. \"And then now we get the Trump crisis.\"\n\nThis \"Trump crisis,\" I suggested, has ensured that Pritzker receives an overwhelming amount of national attention, perhaps more than he ever has. Winding up in a Chicago beef with Donald Trump might be welcome, of course, for a Democrat with possible presidential plans. Pritzker disputed this, too, or at least smirked at the idea that the intense spotlight is a big deal to him. \"I think Gavin Newsom gets way more attention than I do,\" he told me, referring to his counterpart in California, who has also been mentioned as a possible presidential candidate in 2028 -- and who, like Pritzker, Trump has said should be arrested.\n\nRead: The week that changed everything for Gavin Newsom\n\nAt the Kennedy Expressway event, I watched Pritzker standing behind a podium, surrounded by a cluster of state and local politicians, members of his administration, business and labor leaders, and a few dozen people in hard hats and vests. The governor has a thick helmet of brown hair; a large, round, sculpted-looking face; and an overall bowling-ball bearing -- something between Babe Ruth and Ralph Kramden. When it was Pritzker's turn to speak at the ceremony, he seemed to relish the highway reopening as a tactile triumph, something that felt blissfully like normal governor's stuff.\n\n\"It isn't the flashiest project,\" he said, after mentioning the 16 new overhead signs and 1,200 new LED fixtures that now adorn the revamped road, which carries 275,000 vehicles a day. He described the project as \"gritty, foundational, and absolutely essential work.\"\n\n\"At a time of historic division in our politics, there is one idea that we can all rally around,\" Pritzker said. \"And that's 'Traffic sucks.'\"\n\nThis reprieve from the \"Trump crisis\" ended for Pritzker as soon as he commenced with questions from the press, about half of which involved ICE, CBP, or the president. The governor talked about a new \"accountability commission\" that he had introduced the day before, composed of a variety of community leaders. The commission's charge will be to document any potentially illegal behavior that federal authorities engage in while they are in Illinois.\n\nPritzker explained his rationale to me. For as long as Trump is president, he said, no ICE or CBP agents, and no civilian managers loyal to the president, will be held accountable for improper or illegal actions. The commission's objective is to preserve documents, citizen-provided videos, and testimonials that could come in handy during future congressional hearings (if Democrats win control of Congress) or legal actions (after Trump leaves office).\n\nThe governor told me that he also envisions a deterrent effect. \"Someone who is acting improperly now, who's acting abusively now,\" he said, \"will likely think twice if they think that there's going to be a record of it and that eventually this will come back to haunt them.\"\n\nAmong nationally known Democratic figures, Pritzker has offered decidedly dire admonitions. He asserted last week that these combative incursions by Trump-controlled security forces are likely a precursor to the White House trying to manipulate next year's midterm elections. \"Look, I'm not a conspiracy theorist,\" Pritzker told me. But it's impossible, he said, to ignore everything that Trump has done in the past, especially after the 2020 presidential election, and not conclude that something is afoot. Pritzker can easily foresee ICE, CBP, and other officers standing outside polling places in uniform, carrying automatic weapons.\n\nRead: The destruction of one of America's oldest traditions\n\n\"I think that all the pieces of something nefarious seem to be occurring, and I'm just putting the pieces together,\" Pritzker told me. \"I'm hopeful I'm wrong, but I don't think we can assume that I'm wrong.\" He made the same basic point to me that he does in pretty much every context of his job these days: Authoritarianism comes fast. \"And if you're not willing to stand up and push back while it's happening in the early days,\" he added, \"it gets a lot harder later.\"\n\nPritzker told me that he is running for his third term as governor next year and isn't focused on the 2028 presidential campaign. He keeps getting asked about the latter, which he says is \"flattering\" but probably annoying, more than anything. He complained to me about how, at an off-the-record media briefing the night before, one reporter had kept trying to steer the discussion to 2028. \"I'm like, 'Dude, you know, there's a whole lot going on right now,'\" Pritzker said, clapping twice for emphasis.\n\nYes, there's a lot going on right now. I wished the governor \"precedented times.\"",

        "title": "Average price for a new car surpasses $50,000 for first time",
        "description": "If you've dropped by a car lot lately and received a severe dose of sticker shock, you're not just imagining things.\n\nThe average transaction price for a new vehicle in the U.S. surpassed $50,000 for the first time, according to a new estimate by Kelley Blue Book.\n\nThe price climb has even alarmed car dealers in California, the state with the most drivers in the nation and the place that has long defined car culture in the U.S.\n\n\"That's really concerning because what that means is that only wealthier Californians are going to be able to enter the new car market,\" said Brian Maas, president of the California New Car Dealers Association.\n\n\"And that's not good for the industry, it's not good for consumers, it's not good for dealers, it's not good for the automakers. We need a broad range of consumers to be in the new car market and if only wealthy folks are buying those cars, that's a concern.\"\n\nThe average price has been on a steady rise for years and analysts with Cox Automotive, which owns Kelley Blue Book, attribute the most recent increase to a combination of factors.\n\nThat includes tariffs imposed by the Trump administration, but they said prices in September were mostly driven by \"a healthy mix\" of electric vehicles that tend to be more expensive than gasoline-powered cars and trucks plus higher-end vehicles that pushed the average price to new heights.\n\n\"We've been expecting to break through the $50,000 barrier,\" Cox Automotive executive analyst Erin Keating said in a news release. \"It was only a matter of time, especially when you consider the best-selling vehicle in America is a pickup truck from Ford that routinely costs north of $65,000. That's today's market, and it is ripe for disruption.\"\n\nThe average transaction price came to $50,080 in September, up 2.1% from August and 3.6% higher year-over-year.\n\nAccording to the Kelley Blue chart, the average price in the U.S. hit $40,000 in March 2020.\n\nCox Automotive reported that last month there were more than 60 models with average transaction prices above $75,000 -- and they accounted for 7.4% of total industry sales, up from 6% at the same time last year.\n\nThe two versions of Cadillac Escalade, priced at six figures, recorded September sales of 4,320 units in the U.S.\n\nThe Cox report said the average price for an EV in September came to $58,124, some 3.5% higher than in August.\n\n\"While there are many affordable options out there, many price-conscious buyers are choosing to stay on the sidelines or cruising in the used-vehicle market,\" Keating said. \"Today's auto market is being driven by wealthier households who have access to capital, good loan rates and are propping up the higher end of the market.\"\n\nAnother factor accelerating sticker prices is the amount of high-tech features in new cars, such as infotainment systems with large touchscreens, automatic emergency braking, in-car Wi-Fi, battery systems in hybrids and semi-autonomous driving in electric and high-end vehicles.\n\n\"It's not the vehicle you and I may have grown up driving in the 1970s, '80s or '90s,\" Maas said.\n\nThe popularity of SUVs, which typically cost more than sedans, has also contributed to the average price going up.\n\n\"Figuring out how you make a profitable entry-level car ... that's the trick,\" Maas said. \"And I think the smart manufacturers are looking around and trying to figure out how can we do that? Because there's a giant market to be tapped there. If you can figure out how to make a $25,000, $30,000 entry-level vehicle, you're gonna kill it in this market, I think.\"\n\nBreaking the $50,000 barrier comes as third-quarter figures saw a leap in registrations of EVs and plug-in hybrids. A record number of customers jumped on the zero-emissions bandwagon before the expiration of federal tax credits.\n\nTesla's Model Y remained the top-selling vehicle in California, with 35,336 deliveries in the third quarter alone and 79,448 from the start of this year through Sept. 30, according to data from Experian Automotive, posted by the California New Car Dealers Association.\n\nToyota's RAV4 came in a distant second place, with 49,584 registrations so far this year.\n\nThe market share for purchases of new cars and light trucks that qualify as zero-emission vehicles by California policymakers -- EVs, plug-in hybrids and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles -- accounted for 24.7% of the market share in Q3, up from 18.2% the previous quarter.\n\nBut the federal tax credit of up to $7,500 on the purchase or lease of a new EV, and as much as $4,000 on a used one, came to an end on Sept. 30. The expiration was part of the 940-page federal budget legislation dubbed the \"One Big Beautiful Bill\" backed by Republicans on Capitol Hill and signed into law in July by President Donald Trump.\n\n\"There was definitely a pull-ahead effect\" by consumers to buy EVs before the Sept. 30 deadline, Ivan Drury, senior manager of auto insights at Edmunds.com, told the Union-Tribune earlier this month. \"So you would expect to see that October sales should be down a bit.\"\n\nThe question will be how much the loss of the incentives will affect sales of EVs and plug-in hybrids.\n\nNationally, electric vehicles make up about 8% to 12% of auto purchases.\n\nSpeaking at a conference Sept. 30, Ford CEO Jim Farley said, \"I wouldn't be surprised if EV sales in the U.S. go down to 5%,\" adding that while the zero-emission sector will remain a \"vibrant industry\" going forward, it's also \"going to be smaller, way smaller than we thought.\"\n\nThe chairman of Nissan's Americas region told the Wall Street Journal that October should be the worst market in years for EVs. \"Manufacturers are going to have to push cars away because demand is not going to be there,\" Christian Meunier said.\n\nBut California political leaders and regulators say they're confident the state will reach its aggressive zero-emission vehicle goals.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom issued an executive order five years ago mandating the elimination of sales of all new gasoline-powered passenger vehicles throughout California by 2035.\n\nIn June, President Trump signed three Congressional Review Act resolutions rescinding California's electric vehicle mandates -- as well as rules related to diesel engines. But California and 10 other states have filed a lawsuit, arguing that Trump's actions are unconstitutional and beyond the authority of Congress.\n\n\"We're setting new records because this state believes in innovation, not isolation,\" Newsom said of the state's third quarter zero-emission sales figures. \"While Trump sells out American innovation to China, California will keep charging ahead on our path to a future of cleaner air.\"\n\nRegardless of powertrain, the California New Car Dealers Association projects new car sales in the state will come to 1.79 million for all of 2025, improving upon the 1.75 million registrations recorded last year.",

        "title": "Democratic states sue to force SNAP payments during shutdown",
        "description": "A SNAP sign at the entrance of a Big Lots store in Portland, Oregon. (iStock)\n\nWith the nation's primary anti-hunger program on the verge of running out of money, a group of 23 Democratic attorneys general sued the Agriculture Department on Tuesday to force it to make billions of dollars in contingency funds available to help feed the most vulnerable individuals and families.\n\nSNAP, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program commonly known as food stamps, needs $9.2 billion to pay benefits in November. The Trump administration has said there's no money for next month because of the government shutdown, which started Oct. 1 and doesn't appear close to ending.\n\nUSDA has $5.5 billion on hand in contingency funds for the program, enough to cover more than half of the month's costs, but it cannot pay them, a senior administration official told The Washington Post on Monday.\n\nThat money is meant to be held in case of natural disasters or other catastrophes, not used to cover for a lapse in government funding, said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nBut the state attorneys general argue in their lawsuit that withholding the contingency funds violates federal spending laws and that the administration should be required to disburse the money, even if it covers only partial payments for the month.\n\nAround 42 million people rely on SNAP benefits each month; the average benefit is $332 per household, according to federal data.\n\n\"Millions of Americans are about to go hungry because the federal government has chosen to withhold food assistance it is legally obligated to provide,\" New York Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement. \"There is no excuse for this administration to abandon families who rely on SNAP, or food stamps, as a lifeline. The federal government must do its job to protect families.\"\n\nThe federal government pays the full cost of SNAP benefits, meaning states do not have a budget to fund the mass-scale program, though states do implement the payments. If benefits lapse Saturday, it would mark the first time in the program's 60-year history where the federal government fails to make the food-assistance payments because of a pause in appropriations.\n\nIn a memo to states sent Friday, USDA officials argued that \"contingency funds are not legally available to cover regular benefits.\"\n\n\"It has never been used to complement benefits,\" the senior administration official said. \"We've never had a lapse in appropriations like this. It's something that has not been tested, but precedent is for times of disaster.\"\n\nDuring previous shutdowns, USDA said states could use the contingency fund to pay for SNAP, including during the longest-ever closure, which ran from December 2018 into January 2019 in the first Trump administration. At that time, the administration told states through USDA memos that they could access the funds to pay for SNAP.\n\nA USDA spokesperson, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of agency policy, said Democrats were responsible for the looming crisis.\n\n\"We are approaching an inflection point for Senate Democrats,\" the spokesperson said in a statement. \"Continue to hold out for the Far-Left wing of the party or reopen the government so mothers, babies, and the most vulnerable among us can receive timely WIC and SNAP allotments.\"\n\nWIC payments, which go to low-income families and children under 5, are continuing despite the shutdown, funded by tariff revenue under a long-standing provision in the law.\n\nEven though USDA has said it will not refund states for sending food-assistance payments to residents if SNAP funding is halted, some states have made plans to keep funds flowing regardless. In New York, for example, Gov. Kathy Hochul (D) allocated $30 million for food aid and $11 million for food banks and pantries as a stopgap effort. But the funds don't cover even a week of what the state typically distributes in monthly SNAP benefits -- which regularly total about $650 million.\n\nOther governors, like California's Gavin Newsom (D), have said they will help their states' food banks as they struggle with extra demand caused by the missing payments. Other states, however, have not yet presented a stopgap plan.\n\nLawmakers from both sides of the aisle have raised the alarm over SNAP funding cuts. Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Missouri) introduced legislation meant to keep SNAP funded next month. The bill is co-sponsored by 10 other Republicans and one Democrat, Sen. Peter Welch (Vermont). In an X post announcing the bill, Hawley blamed Democrats for the potential lapse in funding, saying it could happen because they \"REFUSE to fund the government.\"\n\nBut Democrats blame Republicans and President Donald Trump for the uncertainty, accusing them of holding food stamps hostage. Democratic Sen. Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n, who represents New Mexico, the state with the highest SNAP participation rate, said that the shutdown has not stopped Trump from sending tens of billions of dollars to \"his political allies in Argentina,\" or $300 million to build the White House ballroom.\n\n\"But when it comes to feeding our fellow Americans, his administration is choosing to play politics,\" Luj\u00e1n said in a statement. \"The administration must release the available SNAP funds immediately to ensure millions of Americans don't go hungry.\"\n\nThe administration has also moved money around to cover other spending during the shutdown, including pay for military personnel and law enforcement agents in the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nAdvocates and experts have voiced skepticism over the legality of the USDA memo blocking states from accessing the contingency funds.\n\n\"This is unprecedented,\" said Gina Plata-Nino, the interim SNAP director at the Food Research and Action Center, arguing that Congress has not withdrawn the funds and that until those are repealed, the agency can't block states from accessing them.\n\nThe memo, she said, \"is not a policy memo. It looks more like a political memo.\"\n\n\"The [Congress] archive still says that they could use contingency funding in order to ensure that SNAP benefits are not delayed,\" she said.",

        "description": "California passes bills to let voters redraw U.S. House maps in 2026, countering Texas' planned redistricting to boost GOP seats. (Scripps News)\n\nThere's a reason the political world is obsessed with the Nov. 4 gubernatorial elections in New Jersey and Virginia: They're the only ones we've got this year.\n\nThe off-year elections in two random states, plus the New York City mayor's race and the California redistricting referendum, provide the first significant opportunities since the 2024 presidential race for voters to weigh in on which party they credit and which one they blame for what's happened since then.\n\nCan Republicans in New Jersey turn out the new voters who supported Donald Trump even though he's not on the ballot? Have Democrats in the two states found a template for victory by nominating moderate women with national-security backgrounds? Can presidential hopefuls build credibility for 2028 by delivering on favored causes this November?\n\nA dose of caution is advisable. Predictions of what will happen down the road are open to misinterpretation, and whatever signals they send could be overtaken by developments.\n\nThat said, here we go.\n\nCan the GOP turn out Trump voters without Trump?\n\nHistory says Republican Jack Ciattarelli should win in New Jersey.\n\nNever in the past six decades has either party managed to hold the Garden State's governorship for more than two terms in a row, and Democrat Phil Murphy has been in power for the last eight years.\n\nBut Democrat Mikie Sherrill, 53, now leads the 63-year-old Ciattarelli by 50%-44%, according to a Quinnipiac Poll taken Oct. 9-13. That six-point edge is a stitch closer than Sherrill's eight-point lead in a September survey.\n\nThe poll did give Ciattarelli an edge on enthusiasm: 55% of his likely voters said they were \"very enthusiastic\" about supporting him, compared with 42% of Sherrill's likely voters.\n\nA Democratic victory would be a warning flag for the GOP - a sign that the traditionally Democratic voters Trump gained, especially in Hispanic and working-class communities, may not show up for other Republican candidates.\n\nWhile Trump lost the Democratic-leaning state in 2024, he scored a stronger performance than in his previous two presidential runs, finishing just under 6 points behind Democrat Kamala Harris. It was one of the biggest swings in his direction of any state in the country.\n\n\"I think Trump has done right by New Jersey,\" Ciattarellli told the USA TODAY Network, praising the president's tax cuts and other policies. \"I do not think that his endorsement or his involvement is hurtful to my campaign.\"\n\nStill, he bristled when pressed on Trump's impact. \"Why are you so fixated on him?\" he demanded.\n\n\"I think voters in New Jersey are largely focused on New Jersey,\" Sherrill, a four-term member of the House and former U.S. Navy officer, said when asked whether the election would be a litmus test for politics nationally. Still, she told the USA TODAY Network, \"Often there's a lot you can learn as a precursor to what's coming.\"\n\nCan Republicans defy history and hold Virginia?\n\nFor 11 of the past 12 elections, Virginia has chosen as governor the candidate of the party that didn't carry the White House a year earlier.\n\nThat's been true regardless of which party won the presidency and whether Virginia had backed the winner. Since 1977, the pattern has been broken just once. In 2013, Democrat Terry McAuliffe prevailed a year after Barack Obama's reelection. (By the way, it was in the wake of a government shutdown that was generally blamed on congressional Republicans.)\n\nBut when McAuliffe tried to stage a comeback in 2021, a year after Joe Biden's election, the historic pattern held. He lost to Republican Glenn Youngkin.\n\nThis time, Democrat Abigail Spanberger, 46, a former three-term House member who once worked for the CIA, has held a consistent lead over Republican Winsome Earle-Sears, 61, now the lieutenant governor. A Suffolk University survey, taken Oct. 19-21, showed Spanberger up by 9 percentage points, 52%-43%.\n\nDemocrats hope a backlash to the current government shutdown and the Trump administration's previous federal layoffs will boost their candidates. Tens of thousands of federal workers live in the northern Virginia suburbs.\n\nA late controversy has enmeshed the Democratic nominee for attorney general, Jay Jones, over text messages he sent in 2022. In them, he joked about shooting a former Republican House speaker with \"two bullets in the head.\" He has apologized. Spanberger denounced the texts as \"absolutely abhorrent\" but didn't call on him to withdraw from the race.\n\nThere has also been a small drama over whether Trump will endorse Earle-Sears. In August, he said, \"I would, yeah,\" but at least so far, he hasn't. It's possible he remembers her comment in 2022 that she wouldn't support his third presidential bid, saying it was \"time to move on.\"\n\nWhoever wins will make history: The first female governor in Virginia.\n\nIn NYC, a leftward turn for Democrats? Or just for New York?\n\nHistory is brewing in New York City's mayoral race, too.\n\nDemocratic nominee Zohran Mamdani, 34, is poised to become the first Democratic Socialist and the first Muslim to be elected mayor of the nation's largest city.\n\nHe led former New York governor Andrew Cuomo, 67, a registered Democrat running as an independent, by 10 points in a Suffolk University poll taken Oct. 23-26. That's closer than the 20-point lead Mamdani held in September - taken before incumbent Eric Adams abandoned his reelection bid and endorsed Cuomo - but it's still in the comfortable territory of double digits.\n\nFor Republicans, Mamdani's election would be welcomed as evidence that the Democratic party has taken a sharp leftward turn. Trump called Mamdani \"one of the best things to ever happen to our great Republican party,\" labeling him a Communist and threatening to withhold federal funds to the president's own hometown if he wins.\n\nBut even top Democrats are divided over whether to back him. Mamdani has been endorsed by the state's Democratic governor, Kathy Hochul, but House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries, a fellow New Yorker, waited until the day before early voting began to back him. Mamdani has still not won over either of New York's Democratic senators, Chuck Schumer or Kirsten Gillibrand.\n\nSome Democrats credit Mamdani, now a member of the state Assembly, as a charismatic figure who has energized young and racially diverse voters in the city. But others worry that his very progressive proposals will reverberate against Democratic candidates who face more centrist electorates.\n\nHe backs temporarily freezing rents in rent-stabilized apartments, opening five city-owned grocery stores, raising the minimum wage to $30 per hour, and offering free childcare and fare-free city buses. He has also pledged as mayor to order the arrest of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu if he visits New York, honoring a warrant issued by the International Criminal Court for war crimes in Gaza.\n\nFor Newsom and Shapiro, 2028 is just around the corner\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom has taken on Republican efforts to flip Democratic-held seats by redrawing House district lines in Texas and elsewhere. He's trying to do the same thing in California, with the goal of costing Republicans seats.\n\nBecause of the state's laws, that requires voters to pass a referendum, now on the ballot in November.\n\nProposition 50 seems poised to pass, favored by 20 points in an Emerson College poll taken Oct. 20-21.\n\nCalifornia's move could help offset the five additional House seats Republican hope to gain in Texas' redistricting. Every seat counts in the 2026 midterms, where Democrats at the moment need to gain just three seats to win control of the House of Representatives.\n\nIt could also help Newsom's ambitions to run for president in 2028 as a leader who pushed back against Trump and the GOP. Polling for the 2028 field is sensibly scarce, but an Emerson College survey in August found Newsom leading the Democratic field, with former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg second and former vice president Kamala Harris third.\n\nThen there's Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, another presidential hopeful. He's appearing in TV ads supporting three state Supreme Court justices in a yes-or-no \"retention\" vote, on whether to grant them new 10-year terms.\n\nAt stake could be the political disposition of Pennsylvania's highest court, where liberals now have a 5-2 majority. Shapiro could name interim successors, but permanent justices would have to be confirmed by the Republican-controlled state Senate.\n\nBoosting the justices' retention just might be a good thing for Shapiro and his bigger ambitions, too.",

        "description": "\"Joe Rogan's the Facebook of podcasting,\" the California Governor tells Elex Michaelson on the first episode of CNN's \"The Story Is\"\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom said Monday night that he no longer has any interest in appearing on Joe Rogan's podcast.\n\nOn the debut episode of CNN's \"The Story Is With Elex Michaelson,\" Newsom shared that he has moved on from any hopes he may have had about ever appearing on \"The Joe Rogan Experience.\" \"For years and years, he's been attacking me and it's one way and he won't have me on,\" he explained. \"He's consistently not having me on. By the way, I'm moving on. I have no interest.\"\n\n\"Joe Rogan's the Facebook of podcasting,\" Newsom added, prompting Michaelson to remark that Rogan still has a \"pretty big audience.\" \"With all due respect, if he has a big audience but he doesn't have big enough confidence -- I didn't go there -- to have me on...\" Newsom said, to which Michaelson further noted that the politician has called Rogan a chicken on social media in the past.\n\nIn early October, Rogan criticized Newsom on one of his episodes, calling his fellow podcaster a \"good bulls -- t artist\" and mocking his rumored presidential aspirations. \"You can't ruin a city and then go on to ruin a state and say, 'Guys, that was just practice. Once I get in as president, I'm gonna fix it all,'\" Rogan said of Newsom's work as both the former Mayor of San Francisco and current Governor of California.\n\nNewsom previously responded to a clip of Rogan's criticism, writing at the time that the podcaster was \"too [chicken emoji] to have me on his show and expose his listeners to the truth.\" Newsom went on to list a number of positive, current statistics about California, concluding: \"I could continue... invite me on any time.\"\n\nNow, it seems Newsom has rescinded that latter comment. \"Here's the thing. These guys, they all have something in common. It's one way,\" Newsom said of Rogan. \"They attack, they belittle, they demean, they take things out of context. But this is a serious thing, and so often we just sit back and go, 'Oh, God, I really would love to go on. Oh, if Kamala Harris just went on Joe Rogan, she would have won.' It's so much deeper than that.\"\n\nElsewhere in the interview, Newsom again teased the idea of running for president in 2028 -- considering that year's election may not be fair if Trump ends up, somehow, running for a third term despite the 22nd Amendment.",

        "title": "Redistricting reversal: Virginia Democrats move to ditch bipartisan map, joining nationwide drive",
        "description": "It wasn't long ago that Democrats were hailing Virginia's move to use a bipartisan commission to draw its congressional boundaries as a win for fair elections.\n\nNow they're moving fast to scrap it -- at least temporarily -- as they seek to maximize their partisan advantage in a tug-of-war for control of the U.S. House in next year's elections.\n\nThe commonwealth's Legislature kicked off a special session Monday in Richmond to begin the process of sidelining the current map, which offers a 6-5 Democratic advantage. They intend to replace it with one that would give them at least nine House seats.\n\nTo do so, Democratic lawmakers would have to pass legislation to put a replacement map on the ballot. They would have to re-pass that legislation in their regular session early next year, then rush the measure to voters in a special election to approve the new map for use in November 2026.\n\nThose who fought hard for bipartisan commissions to take the politics out of redistricting have been disheartened by how quickly the commitment crumbled when the politics got rough.\n\n\"This is an arms race to the bottom,\" said Brian Cannon, who helped lead Virginia's effort to establish a commission. \"President Trump got it going with Texas, and [California Gov.] Gavin Newsom followed, and now we are seeing the ripple effects across the country.\"\n\nVirginia Democrats would be overriding a map imposed by the Virginia Supreme Court, which acted after the state's bipartisan commission failed to agree on a map after the 2020 census.\n\nOne after the other\n\nThe commonwealth is following California, whose Legislature is also controlled by Democrats and where voters are being asked to approve a similar referendum to scrap their commission-drawn lines in favor of a map that could nearly wipe Republicans out of the state's 52-seat delegation.\n\nCalifornia said it is responding to Texas, whose GOP-controlled Legislature redrew its lines to secure up to five new House seats for Republicans.\n\nRepublican-led Missouri has also redrawn its lines, and Republicans in Indiana will attempt to draw a new map next month.\n\nUsually, maps are drawn only once after each census. But mid-decade redistricting is not unheard of. Ohio redrew its lines seven times from 1876 to 1892, changing as control of the Legislature flipped back and forth.\n\nWhat makes this year different is the move to overturn the bipartisan commissions that were all the rage over the last two decades, particularly in blue states.\n\nRep. Morgan Griffith, a Republican who previously served in Virginia's House of Delegates, noted that nearly two-thirds of voters in his state approved the commission system in 2020.\n\n\"To come in now in the middle of an election and say, 'we want to change the rules because non-partisanship does not suit your current partisan needs' -- that's wrong,\" Mr. Griffin said. \"It's just, it's just brazen partisan politics in a process that the voters of Virginia overwhelmingly approved.\"\n\nVirginia state Delegate Lee Ware, a Republican, criticized the partisan push, arguing Monday on the floor of the House of Delegates that it runs counter to the commonwealth's political traditions.\n\n\"Candor requires admitting that this bad idea of mid-decade redistricting did get its 2025 launch by the president,\" Mr. Ware said. \"However, just because a bad idea was proposed and even taken up by a few of our sister states, such as North Carolina or California, is not a reason for Virginia to follow suit.\"\n\nHe concluded with a sharp rebuke: \"In short, it is to belatedly attach Virginia to the tail of a bandwagon that is unworthy of her history and unworthy of this body's long heritage.\"\n\nA week before statewide elections, Virginia's redistricting has spilled over into the governor's race.\n\nDemocratic nominee Abigail Spanberger, a former member of Congress and polling frontrunner, has appeared to shift her stance from initially declaring she had \"no plans to redistrict Virginia\" to now expressing openness to the initiative advanced by the Democrat-controlled General Assembly.\n\nLt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, the Republican nominee who has consistently backed the independent redistricting commission, chastised the special session and the Democrats' motivations.\n\nMeanwhile, the special session has disrupted the plans of state delegates seeking re-election, forcing them to return to Richmond during what would have been their final full week of campaigning before Election Day.\n\n'A break-glass moment'\n\nMr. Trump looms large over Democrats' reversal on redistricting, said Stephen J. Farnsworth, a political science professor at the University of Mary Washington.\n\n\"Remember, Democrats are looking at the fact that Donald Trump, even now, refuses to accept that he lost the 2020 election,\" Mr. Farnsworth said. \"The world is very different when you think about the way that both parties accepted whether they won or lost elections before 2020.\"\n\nHe also said Democrats now feel the commissions amount to \"unilateral disarmament\" in the face of GOP gains in Texas.\n\nMr. Cooper, who pushed the commission idea in Virginia, said even some of those he worked with are now embracing the overturn effort because having Mr. Trump in office with a GOP-led Congress is too much.\n\n\"For them, this is a break-glass moment for all sorts of reasons,\" he said.\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican who as governor of California led the push for that state's commission, was dismayed by his state's reversal.\n\n\"You know, Texas started it. They did something terribly wrong, and then all of a sudden, California says, 'Well, then we have to do something terribly wrong,'\" he said on CNN's \"State of the Union\" over the weekend.\n\nMr. Schwarzenegger dismissed the notion that the changes would be short-lived, arguing advocates would \"find an excuse\" to make revised maps permanent.\n\nPolls show the California measure is poised to pass.\n\nBut the jury is out on Democrats' effort in Virginia, where they hold a narrow 21-19 majority in the state Senate and a 51-48 majority in the state House.\n\nThe change could also face legal hurdles. The state's constitution requires that ballot referendums be approved by the Legislature in two separate sessions, with an intervening election.\n\nRepublicans argue that the current election cycle is already underway, with early voting beginning on Sept. 19, so the measure couldn't be put to voters until after next November.",

Rural voters would be outnumbered, making it unlikely for a Republican candidate to prevail.\n\n\"Most of us see it as, you know, just massive gerrymandering, taking what little representation that we had away and now we'll have absolutely nothing,\" Patrick Jones, a former Shasta County supervisor, said in a recent interview in his family's gun shop.\n\nVoting concludes Nov. 4 on the measure, which would create partisan U.S. House maps outside of normal once-a-decade redistricting handled by an independent commission. It's an effort by Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom to counter a Trump-backed plan in Texas to gain five more Republican seats. He says it's necessary to defend democracy, but California Republicans call it a power grab that will disenfranchise voters. Republicans currently hold nine of the state's 52 congressional seats.\n\nIn Redding, one of the largest cities north of Sacramento, bright yellow signs urging residents to defend fair elections and rural representation dot the highway. A local man recently led a one-person protest in front of City Hall, while more than 150 others showed up at a rally to reject what they see as a scheme by Democrats to take away their voices.\n\nThey face an uphill battle in the state where registered Democrats outnumber Republicans by nearly 2-to-1. Democrats have returned nearly twice as many ballots. Labor unions and other Democratic allies have mobilized hundreds of volunteers to reach voters in solidly blue areas like Los Angeles with millions of voters. Two weeks before Election Day, just about 7,000 ballots had been returned in Shasta County, county clerk Clint Curtis said. He expects lower turnout than normal.\n\nTV advertising opposing the measure -- a key investment in the sprawling state -- has largely dried up.\n\nUnder the new maps, voters in Shasta, Siskiyou and Modoc counties -- all conservative strongholds in the rural north -- would be in the same congressional district with Marin County, which sits just across the Golden Gate Bridge from San Francisco.\n\nMr. LaMalfa's current district includes farms that grow rice, olive and other tree nuts, and ranching is prevalent in the farthest northern reaches. Lassen National Volcanic Park, historic Shasta Dam and snow-capped Mt. Shasta are defining features. Redding has a population under 100,000. Distrust of government and belief in election conspiracies are common. In 2024, 67% of voters in Shasta County supported Mr. Trump.\n\nMarin County, meanwhile, went 80% for Democrat Kamala Harris. The median household income tops $140,000 -- roughly double that of Shasta County. It's part of a district that runs north up the Pacific coastline to Oregon and is known for redwood forests, wine production and cannabis farms. It's represented by Democratic Rep. Jared Huffman.\n\nMr. LaMalfa, a rice farmer, opposes the proposition and has spent at least $63,000 from his campaign fund to reach voters through text messages and yard signs. He also gave $50,000 to a statewide \"no\" campaign.\n\nMr. LaMalfa's supporters say they appreciate his conservative stances and push for an important new water storage project.\n\n\"I pretty much love the guy,\" said Bob Braz, a Redding area native who owns a bait shop. \"I stand for almost all the things that he's done.\"\n\nThose who don't know much about Mr. LaMalfa's record said they trust him because of his background.\n\n\"I don't hear much about him but he's a farmer,\" said Liz Jacobs, who moved from the Bay Area to Redding 20 years ago. She added: \"I don't know about somebody from the Bay Area with their progressive ideas.\"\n\nMr. Newsom and other Democrats say the measure is a tool to fight Mr. Trump's agenda and counter Republican efforts to pick up seats elsewhere. Even if it passes and Democrats win five more seats, it may not help the party retain the House. Republicans in Missouri, North Carolina and Indiana are joining Texas in trying to draw more winnable seats in the 2026 midterms. Lawmakers in Virginia, meanwhile, are back in session to work on a map more friendly to Democrats. All of the efforts are sure to face legal challenges.\n\n\"This is not the fight we want to fight. This was not our battle,\" Mr. Newsom said recently. \"This is in reaction to something unprecedented that happened.\"\n\nBut voters in Redding see it as another way to silence their voices.\n\nThey have long felt neglected by the Democratic-controlled Legislature in Sacramento, which they blame for raising the cost of living and infringing on local control. Lawmakers, for example, banned counties from hand-counting ballots in most cases after Shasta County leaders voted to get rid of their vote-counting machines in 2023.\n\nSome said they worry that national Republicans won't put up a fight to hold the seats if the measure passes.\n\n\"You would have to spend a huge amount of money to reach your base,\" said Mr. Jones, the former county supervisor. \"And they're just simply not going to want to waste that amount of money because it would be better spent throughout the country elsewhere.\"",

        "title": "Whistleblower warns Illegal immigrants are sending 'shockwave' through crucial industry",
        "description": "FIRST ON FOX: Following several high-profile, deadly auto accidents involving illegal alien truck drivers, a commercial trucking industry leader is blowing the whistle on the devastating \"shockwave\" illegal drivers carrying sanctuary state licenses have had on the industry.\n\nMike Kucharski, co-owner and vice president of JKC Trucking, which is based in Illinois, told Fox News Digital that in addition to endangering American roads, illegal alien commercial drivers have been \"killing the trucking business.\"\n\nHe said that though the problem has only recently been brought to the forefront of the public consciousness in recent months, drivers and trucking businesses have been feeling the impacts for years.\n\n\"We knew there was an issue right after COVID because the rates dropped down, and we just thought, 'Okay, look, it's just inflation ... the wars, etcetera, all these aspects causing the volumes to be down. We're thinking, 'Okay. In the long run, these volumes will go back up to what they were pre-COVID conditions or just go back to regular volumes, and we'll be back in business.' But what happened? The complete opposite happened,\" he said. \"They went down and stayed down, and we never knew, as truckers, what was the problem.\"\n\nWHITE HOUSE SAYS CALIFORNIA GRANTED LICENSE TO ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT TRUCKER CHARGED IN FATAL DUI CRASH\n\nNow, with recent revelations from the Trump Department of Transportation and Secretary Sean Duffy about rampant illegal alien truckers on American roads, Kucharski said the truth is finally out.\n\nDuffy issued a bombshell report on Thursday accusing California of violating federal law by issuing a commercial driver's license to a foreign asylum seeker whose semi-truck crash killed three people last week.\n\nThe report alleges that Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom's administration ignored a federal order to halt noncompliant licenses and revoke improperly issued credentials, a failure that, according to Duffy, cost \"three innocent souls.\"\n\nFederal regulators uncovered flaws in how California licenses were obtained by certain commercial truck drivers. The 2025 Annual Program Review and the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) concluded that the state's commercial driver's license (CDL) system suffered from \"systemic policy, procedural, and programming errors\" when it came to handling non-domiciled licenses.\n\nIn an audit letter dated Sept. 26, 2025, investigators also discovered that California had issued CDLs to non-domiciled drivers that were valid even after their federal work authorization expired.\n\nBLUE STATE INVESTIGATES HOW ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT TRUCKER GOT LICENSE BEFORE DEADLY FLORIDA CRASH\n\nKucharski explained further that, though a heavily regulated industry, illegal alien truck drivers can exploit a \"loophole\" in the system by obtaining non-domiciled commercial drivers' licenses from states such as California and New York. They are then able to outcompete legitimate trucking businesses by charging lower prices, leading to the demise of many American small businesses in the industry.\n\n\"As a business owner, I was thinking, 'Well, who is taking all these loads?' Now I could figure it out that this is another shockwave that's hitting the truck industry after COVID and violent volatility, these [non-domiciled] drivers are coming in and doing it for cheaper because they don't care, and ... they don't have social security numbers, and I assume they're probably not filing for taxes. So, if you're not going to pay all your bills, of course, you can do it cheaper and keep on trucking.\"\n\n\"All our truckers are fighting for the same load, and it goes to the lowest bidder,\" he went on. \"If you have these drivers coming in that are non-domiciled, they have no family here, they have no home, they live in their truck ... They're saying, 'Okay, look, all the market's doing for $2,000, we'll do it for $1,700.' So, it's putting small trucking businesses out of business every day.\"\n\n\"We're over-regulated, honestly, in the trucking industry. And if you're overregulated, you think, 'Well, there's no way that this could happen, and it is happening, right now as we speak,\" he said. \"It's eye-opening, disturbing and jaw-dropping.\"\n\nKucharski called on Duffy as well as other industry leaders to take action.\n\nAlong with the report last week, the U.S. Department of Transportation issued an emergency interim final rule that tightened standards for non-domiciled CDLs nationwide. In the rule, stipulations changed and limited eligibility to applicants holding certain employment-based visas. It requires every state to verify their legal status through the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE) database.\n\nUnder the new rule, any non-domiciled commercial learner's permit or CDL must expire no later than the end date on the driver's federal immigration record or after one year, whichever comes first. It also maintains that states must keep proof of their lawful presence on file for at least two years.\n\nILLEGAL IMMIGRANT TRUCK DRIVER IN FATAL CALIFORNIA CRASH SHOULD NEVER HAVE HAD LICENSE: DOT REPORT\n\nIn response to Kucharski's criticisms, a spokesperson for Newsom told Fox News Digital that \"California continues to follow federal rules regarding CDLs.\"\n\n\"Lost in the immigrant-bashing is the fact that drivers holding a California-issued CDL are involved in fatal crashes at a rate far lower than the national average. If the focus were on safety, California should be a poster child, not a scapegoat,\" the spokesperson said.\n\n\"Consistent with federal law, California issued commercial driver's licenses only to drivers if the federal government confirmed their legal presence,\" the spokesperson went on, adding, \"The Trump administration didn't like these federal rules and just recently changed them to restrict refugees, DACA holders, and others from being able to apply for a CDL.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"This is a very serious crisis issue,\" Kucharski said. \"The trucking industry depends on trust. That means ensuring every driver on the road is properly licensed, well-trained, and mentally and physically fit to operate heavy equipment.\"\n\n\"All I can say is strategies like this remind us that reform isn't just about policies, [its] about human lives. And it's on all of us, from the regulators to the fleet owners, to the driver trainers, to ensure the system works the way it should.\"\n\nFox News Digital also reached out to Hochul's office for comment but did not immediately receive a response.",

        "description": "MSNBC host and podcaster Nicolle Wallace claimed \"I don't think any Democrat\" has directly compared German dictator Adolf Hitler and President Donald Trump.\n\nMSNBC host Nicolle Wallace said on Monday she doesn't believe any Democrat has compared President Donald Trump to German dictator Adolf Hitler.\n\nAs ICE continues to detain undocumented immigrants in major U.S. cities, Pritzker has openly likened their actions to those of Nazi enforcers during World War II. Pritzker, who is Jewish, emphasized that he does not make such comparisons lightly.\n\nIn an interview on Wallace's \"The Best People,\" podcast, he mentioned his involvement in helping a Holocaust survivor establish a Holocaust museum. He explained that while he does not believe such a horrific event could recur in America, those who endured it can recognize echoes of authoritarianism emerging under Trump's leadership.\n\nWallace added that equating Trump to Hitler is \"not a partisan analysis,\" recalling how current Vice President JD Vance once questioned whether Trump could be \"America's Hitler.\" She praised Pritzker for articulating a thoughtful argument about the troubling historical similarities between Trump's America and Nazi Germany.\n\nWHITE HOUSE RESPONDS TO LIBERAL PODCAST HOST CALLING STEPHEN MILLER A 'NAZI JEW'\n\n\"You put sort of the intellectual architecture behind the parallels that involve all of us, and you've talked about -- the first thing you said was 'people being asked for their papers,' American citizens being asked to show up with papers, street vendors being asked to produce passports, rounding people up, and good people looking the other way, thinking 'that's not about me.' You know, I'm a citizen. But who do they go after next?\" she asked. \"Talk a little bit about why that's so uncomfortable for so many people.\"\n\nPritzker pushed back somewhat, drawing a distinct line between drawing historical parallels in policy and comparing Trump to Hitler directly. \"I'm not suggesting, I haven't suggested Donald Trump is Hitler,\" Pritzker said.\n\n\"I don't think any democrat has,\" Wallace said. \"And I actually think it's a smear that they project back onto critics. But J.D. Vance called Donald Trump 'cultural heroin.' He called him 'America's Hitler.' I mean, the attacks on Donald Trump as a fascist came from three generals who worked for him.\"\n\nHowever, the record shows that many prominent Democrats, and Wallace herself, have drawn parallels between Trump and Hitler.\n\nAfter Trump drew cheers from a crowd as he embraced the word \"nationalist\" during a 2018 event, she replied, \"I watch enough History Channel to know that they cheered at Hitler, too.\"\n\nProminent Democratic politicians, for years, have been comparing Trump to Hitler.\n\nPRITZKER SWIFTLY FACT-CHECKED AFTER CLAIMING HE NEVER DERIDED GOP WITH DICTATORSHIP COMPARISON: 'PATHOLOGICAL'\n\nFormer Secretary of State Hillary Clinton compared Trump to Hitler during an appearance on \"The View\" in November 2023 when she warned, \"Hitler was duly elected. All of a sudden somebody with those tendencies, dictatorial, authoritarian tendencies, would be like 'OK we're gonna shut this down, we're gonna throw these people in jail.' And they didn't usually telegraph that. Trump is telling us what he intends to do.\"\n\nRep. Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas, has called Trump \"Temu Hitler\" as a means of saying he is a cheap, low-quality imitation and a \"wannabe Hitler.\" In the latter case, she doubled down on doing so even as the national conversation erupted over whether such comparisons spark violence, prompted by the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.\n\nRep. James Clyburn, D-S.C., has been comparing Trump to Hitler for years, including his first term, when he said, \"I can only equate one period of time with what we experience now, and that was what was going on in Germany around 1934, right after the 1932 elections when Adolf Hitler was elected chancellor.\"\n\nWhile he went on to relent and said that Italian dictator Benito Mussolini might be a better comparison, he has continually compared Trump's presidency to Hitler, such as when he spoke to Fox News host Neil Cavuto.\n\n\"Are you envisioning another Hitler? Is that what you're saying?\" Cavuto asked.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nFormer Democratic presidential hopeful Beto O'Rourke compared Trump to Hitler in 2019, essentially arguing that Trump's rhetoric about Mexicans is like something out of Nazi Germany. In 2023, he argued that for Trump, much like Hitler, simply being elected does not make a person any less of a dictator.\n\n\"I can only imagine the history books written 100 years from now looking at the people of 2025,\" O'Rourke said on California Governor Gavin Newsom's podcast. \"It's the way, you know, you and I when we were in school, we're looking at the people in Germany in 1933. That guy's named chancellor in January of that year. In 53 days, he has destroyed German democracy.\"\n\nLiberal documentary filmmaker Michael Moore has drawn Hitler parallels as well, such as in his documentary Fahrenheit 11/9, where in one scene he plays audio of Trump speaking over Hitler rally footage.\n\n\"Hitler and Trump are not the same thing,\" Moore later commented. \"But you are making a foolish mistake if you do not at least take a look at history and the patterns of history and how the manipulation of fear, the manipulation of the public works,\" Moore said. \"I'm not a sky-is-falling person. I don't believe in conspiracy theories. But I am conscious enough to see what's going on. And anyone who's still thinking 'it's not that bad,' 'it's not going to get that bad,' it's time to wake up.\"",

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) and former Vice President Kamala Harris in a new poll.\n\nWith 19% support, Buttigieg leads Newsom - his closest opponent - by 4 percentage points, according to the University of New Hampshire's Granite State Poll, released Monday.\n\nThe only other Democrats in double-digits were Ocasio-Cortez (14%) and Harris (11%).\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) received 8% support and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker garnered a 6% backing.\n\nNew Hampshire traditionally is the first state to hold both Democratic and Republican presidential primary contests.\n\nThe Democratic National Committee has sought to strip New Hampshire of its first-state status over concerns its population is not diverse enough, but the Granite State is bound by state law to host the opening presidential primary contests.\n\nThe survey of 596 voters who planned to vote in New Hampshire's 2028 Democratic presidential primary found Buttigieg with a double-digit lead over all other Dems in terms of net-favorability.\n\nVoters gave Buttigieg a +75% favorability rating. In other words 81% have a favorable opinion of the ex-Biden administration official, whereas only 6% have an unfavorable opinion of him.\n\nSince leaving office, the former Transportation Secretary has faced criticism for spending $80 billion on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) grants, while allegedly delaying air traffic control upgrades.\n\nUnder Buttigieg, the Department of Transportation also brushed aside safety concerns to approve dozens of windmill projects near highways and railroads -- despite acknowledging potential hazards, The Post reported in July.\n\nSanders had the second-highest net-favorability rating, at +59%, followed by Ocasio-Cortez (+56%), Newsom (+47) and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker (+45%).\n\nHarris, who hinted at mounting another run for the White House in an interview with the BBC over the weekend, pulled in just a +38% net-favorability rating.\n\nOn the Republican side, Vice President JD Vance holds a massive lead, according to the poll.\n\nVance received 51% support from 688 likely voters surveyed, topping former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley (9%), Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard (8%) and Secretary of State Marco Rubio (5%).\n\nThe vice president's net-favorability rating is also best among the pack, at +64%, followed by Rubio (+46%), Gabbard (+46%), and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (+40%), who pulled in only 3% support for the GOP nomination.",

The same Instagram account that posted it posted several other fictional posts made to look like they came from Trump.\n\nThe Los Angeles Dodgers are tied 1-1 in the best-of-seven World Series against the Toronto Blue Jays, with game three coming October 27 in L.A.\n\nHowever, Trump has a record of criticizing the leaders of California and Canada before. Here is what to know:\n\nTrump ignores Canada prime minister's MLB bet over tariffs\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Mark Carney wanted to bet Trump on the Toronto Blue Jays beating the Los Angeles Dodgers in the World Series, but said he never got a call back.\n\nInstead, Trump upended trade negotiations with Canada after a television ad with the voice of former President Ronald Reagan talking about tariffs. It was paid for by the Ontario provincial government, the province whose leader threatened to cut off energy flow to some U.S. states if Trump moved forward with its tariffs against the northern neighbor. \"CANADA CHEATED AND GOT CAUGHT!!!\" he wrote on Truth Social on Oct. 23. \"They fraudulently took a big buy ad saying that Ronald Reagan did not like Tariffs, when actually he LOVED TARIFFS FOR OUR COUNTRY, AND ITS NATIONAL SECURITY.\"\n\nReagan said in the voiceover from an April 25, 1987 address, which was spliced up for the ad, that he was not a fan of tariffs but had imposed them on certain Japanese imports in response to Japan violating a semiconductor trade agreement. The ad aired during the first two World Series games but Ontario Premier Doug Ford said it would pause Oct. 27.\n\nTrump has also said Canada should be the 51st state, despite rebuke from local leaders.\n\nTrump and Gavin Newsom in a longstanding feud\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom has been an outspoken critic of Trump, and in turn, Trump often calls him \"Newscum.\"\n\nNewsom has been at the forefront of a state redistricting standoff prompted by Texas lawmakers' move to redraw the state's congressional map to add more Republican seats. On Aug. 14, Newsom announced the Democratic-leaning state would hold a special election to approve a mid-decade redistricting plan in the hopes of adding some more Democratic seats.\n\nThe California governor's office has taken to mimicking Trump's social media style in posts trolling the president and generally poking fun at Republicans online.\n\nNewsom addressed speculation that he would run for the Democratic presidential ticket in 2028 in a \"CBS News Sunday Morning\" interview that aired Oct. 26, saying he is considering it.\n\nContributing: Michael Collins, Joey Garrison, Kathryn Palmer, USA TODAY\n\nKinsey Crowley is the Trump Connect reporter for the USA TODAY Network.

The move was to be carried out by the Justice Department, which said it would deploy observers to several counties in the states following requests from Republican officials who reported irregularities.\n\nThe move comes after the president has repeatedly pushed baseless claims of rampant voter fraud. In California, affected counties include Los Angeles, Orange, Kern, Riverside, and Fresno.\n\nOn Monday, California officials vowed to deploy their own monitors as voters hit the polls to weigh in on a measure that would allow the state to use Democratic-backed congressional maps that they hope will add up to five blue seats to Congress in an effort to counteract a similar move from Texas.\n\nCalifornia Attorney General Rob Bonta (D) told reporters Monday, \"They're not going to be allowed to interfere in ways that the law prohibits.

Nancy Pelosi's (D-Calif.) quick endorsement of then-Vice President Kamala Harris -- and he let it be known in a phone call with the former House speaker, according to a new book.\n\nPelosi described Harris as \"brilliantly astute\" and expressed \"full confidence\" that the ex-California senator could defeat President Trump in her endorsement statement, which came less than 24 hours after Joe Biden ended his 2024 re-election bid.\n\nObama, who preferred to let \"a process\" determine Trump's Democratic Party opponent, called Pelosi shortly after her endorsement to vent his frustration -- having thought they were on the same page, ABC News' Jonathan Karl wrote in \"Retribution,\" out Tuesday.\n\n\"The Obamas were not happy,\" a Pelosi confidant told Karl, according to an excerpt obtained by the Daily Mail.\n\n\"This person summed up Obama's message to Pelosi as, essentially, 'What the f-k did you just do?'\"\n\nIt has been widely reported that the 44th president wanted an open convention to determine the party's nominee, rather than anointing Harris after Biden's shocking drop-out.\n\nObama reportedly had serious concerns about Harris' competence and her ability to beat Trump in the general election.\n\n\"That train has left the station,\" Pelosi reportedly told Obama during their call, according to Karl, apparently referring to Biden's quick endorsement of Harris after announcing his decision to end his campaign.\n\nKarl wrote that Obama and Pelosi both \"agreed Harris should not simply be handed the nomination unchallenged.\"\n\n\"Therefore, Obama and Pelosi -- arguably the two most influential figures in the Democratic Party -- had privately agreed to abstain from making any endorsements,\" the journalist claimed.\n\nThe pair had been in \"regular communication\" leading up to Biden's July 21, 2024, withdrawal announcement, which is why Obama was so stunned by Pelosi's decision to back Harris.\n\nA source close to Obama described the former president's conversation with Pelosi as \"'good-natured ribbing,\" rather than heated, according to Karl.\n\n\"The former president wanted to know what had happened. Why had Pelosi issued a statement endorsing Harris so soon? Hadn't he and Pelosi agreed days earlier that party leaders anointing the vice president as Biden's replacement would be a mistake?\" Karl writes.\n\nHowever, the source close to Pelosi felt Obama sounded \"genuinely irritated\" on the call.\n\nAt least one Biden official believed that Obama, who waited five days after the then-81-year-old president dropped out to endorse Harris, didn't think the former vice president could win.\n\n\"There's only one Black Jesus,\" the senior Biden adviser told Karl.\n\nLike Obama, Pelosi's husband was also surprised by the former House speaker's decision.\n\n\"Kamala?\" Paul Pelosi asked his wife, according to Karl.\n\nTo which Nancy Pelosi shot back: \"Don't start with me.\"\n\nIn \"Retribution,\" Karl notes that with big-name Democrats, such as the Clintons, and potential challengers, like Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and California Gov. Gavin Newsom, quickly endorsing Harris, Pelosi \"had no choice.\"\n\n\"No other candidates had stepped forward -- Kamala Harris was it. The only thing Pelosi could do was try to help her win the election,\" he wrote.\n\nPelosi's office did not immediately respond to The Post's request for comment.",

        "title": "Federal food benefits and preschool aid to run dry starting Saturday if shutdown continues",
        "description": "Federal funds could begin running dry Saturday that help tens of millions of Americans to buy food for their families and send their toddlers to preschool if Congress doesn't reach a deal by then to end the U.S. government shutdown.\n\nFunding for another program that helps mothers care for their newborns could run out the following week.\n\nBarring a resolution to the shutdown, the U.S. will have a gaping hole in its safety net, particularly for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which helps about one in eight Americans buy groceries. Benefits under the program known as SNAP run dry starting Saturday.\n\nFunding for a group of Head Start preschool programs and Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, known as WIC, also could run out soon.\n\nHere's a look at what would happen to each program.\n\nLower-income families who qualify for SNAP receive debit cards loaded each month by the federal government used only for buying groceries at participating stores and farmers markets. The debit cards are recharged in slightly different ways in each state. Not everyone receives their benefits on the first day of the month, though many beneficiaries get them early in the month.\n\nThe average monthly benefit is $187 per person. Most beneficiaries have incomes at or below the poverty level.\n\nThere's also uncertainty about whether benefits left on cards on Nov. 1 can be used. Arkansas officials suggest people who have balances on their cards should use the funds this month on shelf-stable foods. Missouri and Pennsylvania officials expect previous benefits will remain accessible and are telling beneficiaries to save for November if they can.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's administration has rejected the idea of using some $5 billion in contingency money to keep providing the federal cash for food, saying that reserve is limited to expenses such as help after disasters.\n\nThat decision contrasts with a report late last month by the U.S. Department of Agriculture that said a contingency fund could cover SNAP benefits if government funding lapsed.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers and advocacy groups have urged the Trump administration to tap into that fund to provide partial benefits into November.\n\nOfficials in Louisiana, Vermont and Virginia have pledged to backfill food aid for recipients even while the shutdown stalls the federal program, though state-level details haven't been announced.\n\nIn Republican-led Louisiana, the House has voted unanimously for a resolution urging the state's health department to use $150 million in its budget to avoid an interruption in SNAP benefits to nearly 800,000 residents. The measure awaits Senate action, and Republican Gov. Jeff Landry has said it's a top priority.\n\nMore funding for food banks and pantries is planned in states including New Hampshire, Minnesota, California, New Mexico, Connecticut and New York, where Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul said on Monday that she is \"fast tracking\" $30 million in emergency food assistance funds to help keep food pantries stocked.\n\nOfficials from some other states have said they looked into backfilling SNAP benefits with state funds but found they couldn't because states have no way to load funds onto recipients' cards.\n\nDemocratic Gov. Gavin Newsom of California deployed the National Guard to help his state's food banks, though some have declined to use the troops. He is also quickly making $80 million available for food banks.\n\nThe USDA advised Friday that states won't be reimbursed for funding the benefits.\n\nThe Trump administration is blaming Democrats, who say they will not agree to reopen the government until Republicans negotiate with them on extending expiring subsidies under the Affordable Care Act. Republicans say Democrats must first agree to reopen the government before negotiation.\n\nMore than 130 Head Start preschool programs won't receive their annual federal grants on Nov. 1 if the government remains shut down, according to the National Head Start Association.\n\nCenters are scrambling to assess how long they can stay open, since nearly all their funding comes from federal taxpayers. Head Start provides education and child care for the nation's neediest preschoolers. When a center is closed, families may have to miss work or school.\n\nWith new grants on hold, a half-dozen Head Start programs have already missed federal disbursements they were expecting Oct. 1 but have stayed open with fast-dwindling reserves or with help from local governments. All told, more than 65,000 seats at Head Start programs across the country could be affected.\n\nAnother food aid program supporting millions of low-income mothers and young children already received an infusion to keep the program open through the end of October, but even that money is set to run out early next month.\n\nThe Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children helps more than 6 million low-income mothers, young children and expectant parents purchase nutritious staples such as fruits and vegetables, low-fat milk and infant formula.\n\nThe program, known as WIC, was at risk of running out of money in October because of the government shutdown, which occurred right before it was scheduled to receive its annual appropriation. The Trump administration reassigned $300 million in unspent tariff proceeds from the Department of Agriculture to keep the program afloat. But it was only enough money for a few weeks.\n\nNow, states say they could run out of WIC money as early as Nov. 8.",

        "title": "The California Election That Could Tip Congress",
        "description": "When I found Darshan Smaaladen earlier this month, she had joined several hundred of her neighbors at a \"No Kings\" demonstration in Orange County, California. Not that she was there to protest. \"Rallies are great,\" Smaaladen told me, \"but they don't get people out to vote.\"\n\nA year ago, Smaaladen had helped lead a successful campaign to recall two ultraconservative members of Orange County's school board. Now the 52-year-old mother of three was using the \"No Kings\" protest as a campaigning ground for Proposition 50, the ballot measure orchestrated by Governor Gavin Newsom that would redraw California's district map to add as many as five Democratic seats to the party's column in Congress. The outcome of the November 4 referendum could determine whether Democrats have a real shot at winning back the House in next year's midterm elections.\n\nAdvocates and opponents of Prop 50 have already spent more than $200 million on ads starring political luminaries such as Barack Obama and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on the \"yes\" side and Arnold Schwarzenegger on the \"no\" side. In an era of permanent campaigning, this race has become the closest thing America has to a snap election: At Newsom's urging, the California legislature placed the initiative on this fall's ballot in August as a response to Republican gerrymandering in Texas and elsewhere, directed by Donald Trump and his allies.\n\nThe campaign's final weeks have turned into a statewide scramble to persuade California voters to temporarily override the independent redistricting commission that they approved less than two decades ago. The Democratic Party's organizers have found plenty of voters who are eager for the chance to stand against the president and, in Newsom's words, \"fight fire with fire\" in the gerrymandering wars. \"When you talk to people, it's not nuanced. Democrats react really well to an anti-Trump message,\" Florice Hoffman, the chair of the Democratic Party in Orange County, told me.\n\nRead: How Democrats tied their own hands on redistricting\n\nBut organizers have also encountered a worrisome amount of confusion and apathy among Democrats who are not yet sold on matching the GOP's ruthlessness, Smaaladen told me. \"Democrats are a group that loves transparency and equity,\" she explained. \"And so lining things up in a way that's nonequitable is difficult. It takes a few steps to get people to understand that it's not just about California. It's about the nation.\"\n\nThe Democrats' simplest message is to make the election about Trump, who is leaning on Republican lawmakers to aggressively gerrymander as many states as they can in the hopes of pushing the House majority out of reach for Democrats. In addition to remapping Texas, the GOP has already redrawn the lines in Missouri and North Carolina, and it could target seats in Ohio, Indiana, Kansas, and Florida in the coming months. Democrats will try to redraw the map in Virginia and might try to squeeze additional seats out of their strongholds in Maryland and Illinois, but they have fewer opportunities to gerrymander than Republicans do.\n\nCalifornia is by far the Democratic Party's best chance to cut into the GOP's nationwide advantage. In addition to targeting five seats that Republicans currently hold, the Democrats' proposal would shore up several of the party's incumbents in competitive districts. GOP lawmakers in Texas were able to redraw the state's map on their own. Yet in California, because a 2010 referendum took redistricting power away from state legislators, Democrats have to put their plan to a vote. Prop 50 would implement a newly gerrymandered map that would hold until the next decennial census, in 2030, when an independent commission would again draw the lines. \"There is no Plan B,\" Representative Pete Aguilar, the third-highest-ranking House Democrat, whose district includes the Inland Empire, east of Los Angeles, told me. \"We have to win this.\" I asked Aguilar if Democrats could still win the House majority next year if the measure fails. He said they could, but \"it would be incredibly, incredibly hard.\"\n\nRepublicans have tried to counter the Democrats' anti-Trump campaign by framing the ballot initiative as a power grab by Newsom and the opening shot to his all-but-certain 2028 bid for the presidency. But to win in such a heavily Democratic state, a partisan appeal won't be sufficient. \"The challenge for the opposition,\" says Dan Schnur, a longtime GOP strategist in California who is now an independent, is convincing voters \"that their belief in democratic reform is as strong as their feelings about Trump.\"\n\nAs I traveled around Orange County -- the state's most closely divided political battleground -- I heard a version of the same argument from critics of Prop 50. \"I believe they're wrong in allowing Texas to do what they're doing,\" Mary Kay McElmeel, a retired real-estate agent, told me in Mission Viejo. But, she added, \"if somebody does wrong, you don't try to do a bigger wrong.\"\n\nWhen Smaaladen hears this line while speaking with voters, she turns the conversation toward parenting. \"I've always told my children never to hit people. But if somebody were to bully your child on the playground and assault them, that child has a right to hit back,\" she told me. \"I believe that Texas assaulted democracy and that California is allowed to hit back.\"\n\n\"So sometimes,\" Smaaladen concluded, \"two wrongs do make a right.\"\n\nWill O'Neill, the 42-year-old former mayor of Newport Beach, was standing in the middle of a quiet street on a chilly morning earlier this month, complaining about all the evils of gerrymandering. \"We need voters to have the ability to push back on their representatives when they get too far out of line,\" he told me. \"And congressional gerrymandering for partisan purposes tends to lead to more extreme outcomes. It's not good for communities.\"\n\nIf the argument sounds familiar, it's because Democrats spent the first two years of Joe Biden's presidency making it, as part of their failed effort to ban gerrymandering across the country. But O'Neill is no Democrat: He's the chair of the Republican Party of Orange County. O'Neill had brought me to this unusual meeting spot in Mission Viejo because the congressional map that Democrats have proposed for California includes a district line drawn down the center of the suburban street we were standing on. If the measure passes, the houses on one side of the street would fall into a Democratic district that's currently represented by Dave Min, and the houses on the other side would stay with GOP Representative Young Kim. Other lines, O'Neill told me, cut through backyards.\n\nIt's not actually all that unusual for a congressional district to bisect a street; map makers in both parties are notorious for drawing lines that split communities of interest, stretch hundreds of miles in one direction or another, and generally look silly on paper. Courts have repeatedly struck down Republican-drawn maps on the grounds that they constitute illegal racial gerrymanders designed to dilute the electoral power of Black voters, who overwhelmingly cast Democratic ballots. To O'Neill, the crude partitioning of Mission Viejo is evidence of the Democrats' haste and hypocrisy. \"You can't say that you're keeping communities of interest together at the same time you're drawing maps like that,\" he said.\n\nO'Neill isn't necessarily wrong. Democrats readily concede that they are betraying principles of good governance in trying to gerrymander California. But in the face of Trump's naked aggression, they no longer care. \"I support and love an independent redistricting commission. I want one in all 50 states,\" Aguilar told me. But, he said, \"I'm tired of Democrats disarming and doing the right thing while 42 other states play by a different set of rules. It's just ridiculous.\"\n\nTo motivate their base, Republicans are trying to make a distinction between what Texas did to its map and what Newsom has proposed for California. In Texas, they argue, Republican lawmakers were acting to avoid a lawsuit by the Trump administration, which wrote a letter to Governor Greg Abbott accusing the state of using a congressional map that violated the Voting Rights Act. California is facing no such threat.\n\n\"California and Texas are completely different scenarios,\" Mark Meuser, a lawyer who plans to challenge California's new map in court should voters approve it, told me. Meuser was in Laguna Hills to speak at a luncheon of the Southern California Area Republican Women, where he made an impassioned case that although Texas Republicans had been merely trying to fix unconstitutional districts, California Democrats would be taking a perfectly legal congressional map and rendering it unconstitutional.\n\nThe argument was a hit with his audience, a group of staunch Republicans who ate their salads in a hotel ballroom decorated with cardboard cutouts of Trump. And Meuser hopes that if the case makes it to the Supreme Court, the conservative majority will agree with him. But politically, it's quite a stretch. Meuser works for the law firm founded by Harmeet Dhillon, a California Republican who left to become the Trump administration's assistant attorney general for civil rights. In that role, Dhillon wrote the July letter that launched this year's nationwide gerrymandering battle, informing Abbott that the Justice Department believed several Texas districts constituted \"illegal racial gerrymanders\" under the Voting Rights Act.\n\nDhillon's objection was both creative and, to the administration's critics, deeply cynical, considering that the Trump administration is urging the Supreme Court to weaken the same voting protections it accused Texas of violating. In the months since, Republicans in Texas and Washington, D.C., have acknowledged that the Dhillon letter is little more than legal pretext for a political power play. \"I got the highest vote in the history of Texas, and we are entitled to five more seats,\" Trump said in August.\n\nListen: If the Voting Rights Act falls\n\nThe president's candor doesn't help his party's cause in California. After Meuser's speech, I asked him whether Trump's statements -- and similar admissions by other Republicans -- make his task harder. \"It shouldn't, but probably to some degree it does. Judges are human beings,\" Meuser replied. \"The political narrative -- I can't just wash it away.\"\n\nMeuser's frustration is a familiar feeling for Republicans in California, who could end up suffering for the national party's redistricting offensive. No Republican has won a statewide election in nearly 20 years; the state GOP's most influential federal official, former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, was booted after just nine months in 2023. After next year's midterms, if Prop 50 passes, Republicans might hold just four of California's 52 House seats.\n\nIn Washington, Republicans now wield more power than they have in more than a century. But as their statewide clout continues to diminish, California Republicans can celebrate only so much. Kira Davis, a GOP podcaster and member of the club Meuser spoke to, compared the awkward dynamic to \"waking up with your dad's new family on Christmas morning.\"\n\n\"All of his new kids are opening their PlayStation 5 and their remote-control cars,\" Davis told me afterward, \"and you're in the corner opening the lump of coal in your stocking. That's what it feels like to be a Republican in California.\"\n\nLong a bastion of Reagan Republicanism, the sprawling suburbs south of Los Angeles have shifted leftward during the 21st century. Orange County's population is now close to evenly split among white, Latino, and Asian residents, and beginning in 2018, Democrats narrowly overtook Republicans in registration advantage. Since then, its congressional races have been some of the hardest-fought -- and most expensive -- in the country. \"Orange County has become the quintessential purple county in America,\" Jon Gould, the dean of UC Irvine's School of Social Ecology, told me. \"All of the trends that we have seen in American politics over the last 30 years show up, and in some cases, show up first in Orange County.\"\n\nAlthough Kamala Harris narrowly carried the county last year, the margin was much lower than Biden's edge over Trump in 2020. In a rare point of pride for local Republicans, their Senate candidate, the former Dodgers and Padres star Steve Garvey, won more votes than Adam Schiff in Orange County, even as Schiff won in a rout statewide.\n\nDemocrats know that they can pass Prop 50 without carrying Orange County. But a win there would guarantee victory statewide, and the county party sees the campaign as an unexpected opportunity to reconnect with voters who soured on Democrats and stayed home in last year's election. \"This is an organizer's dream,\" Jeffrey C\u00e1rdenas, the Orange County Democrats' organizing director, told me. \"It's exactly what we needed.\"\n\nJonathan Lemire: Fear of losing the midterms is driving Trump's decisions\n\nWe were speaking at the party's county headquarters in Anaheim, where on a Wednesday night a small group of volunteers was phone banking. A half-eaten pizza sat on the table, and the volunteers rang a bell every time they secured another commitment of support. Louise Larsen was making calls to Democrats in her GOP-leaning community of Westminster, trying to recruit volunteers to knock on doors. She told me that she understood the unease over the initiative but that she didn't want \"to give Trump one more crumb of leverage\" in Washington. \"We've got to do what we've got to do\" to win back power, Larsen told me. \"And then we can play fair.\"\n\nC\u00e1rdenas told me that the number of no-shows at canvassing events -- what organizers call the \"flake rate\" -- was much lower than in the past. \"Our base is fired up,\" he said. Still, he wasn't quite ready to predict victory.\n\nPolling has trended in the \"yes\" side's direction lately: A CBS News survey released last week found that 62 percent of California respondents were planning to vote for Prop 50, up from a slim majority in polls earlier in October. Historically, undecided voters tend to break against contentious ballot measures in California. Yet Prop 50 is different from most other referenda because its support is so tied to party lines. Californians also have to want to vote for the measure -- it's the only thing on the ballot this year.\n\nLast week, the Department of Justice announced that it will monitor polling sites in five California locations, including Orange County, next month. Republicans have also been growing more pessimistic as the election nears. \"Watch how totally dishonest the California Prop vote is!\" Trump fumed on Truth Social over the weekend.\n\nOn the day I met Darshan Smaaladen, she had deployed canvassers to knock on doors on the streets surrounding the \"No Kings\" rally; their list included the houses of Republicans and independents. As we walked, the volunteers told me they had generally been encouraged by the support they'd found for Prop 50. But the compressed nature of the campaign was evident in the confusion they encountered among some voters -- especially those who have not closely followed the news. One canvasser said she had swayed some Democrats who wrongly assumed the party wanted them to vote \"no.\" Faye Carroll, a retiree in her 80s, told the volunteers that she would definitely be voting but needed to read more about the issue. When I asked her what she thought about the Republican gerrymandering in Texas that had spawned the ballot initiative, Carroll replied, \"I didn't know about that.\"\n\nOne of the canvassers, a 51-year-old history teacher named Heather Chapman, said the group has also met Democrats who don't particularly like the referendum and the brass-knuckle politics it represents. These are the voters who could ultimately decide its fate and, with their choice, tip the balance of power in Congress. \"They're like, 'In normal times, I would so not be for this. This is not how it's supposed to work,'\" Chapman told me. To that she simply replies: \"Yeah, there is nothing about this that's normal.\"",

Gavin Newsom took a swing Monday at President Donald Trump's health claims, saying \"most people don't take that many cognitive tests unless a doctor is worried\" -- adding to the recent jabs at the president's cognitive and physical health.\n\nTrump, 79, announced during a flight on Air Force One that he was recently at Walter Reed Medical Center for an aptitude test, The Daily Beast reports.\n\nAnd Newsom \"isn't afraid to say the quiet part out loud\" and responded on X, according to The Beast.\n\nThe test reportedly asked Trump to sketch a clock, recognize animal photos and repeat five words in a list. The exam is apparently designed \"to detect mild cognitive impairment as early as possible.\" It is not used as a way to measure IQ or intelligence.\n\nTrump then challenged Democratic Reps.

        "title": "Obama overestimates his political sway",
        "description": "He is still active on the campaign trail, lecturing American voters\n\nLast October, former President Barack Obama had some blunt words for Black men: Get out and vote for Kamala Harris, or else.\n\n\"My understanding, based on reports I'm getting from campaigns and communities, is that we have not yet seen the same kinds of energy and turnout in all quarters of our neighborhoods and communities as we saw when I was running,\" he told a Harris campaign office in Pittsburgh. He said the problem \"seems to be more pronounced with the brothers.\"\n\nMr. Obama scolded: \"And you are thinking about sitting out? Part of it makes me think -- and I'm speaking to men directly -- part of it makes me think that, well, you just aren't feeling the idea of having a woman as president, and you're coming up with other alternatives and other reasons for that.\"\n\nHe mansplained how \"women in our lives have been getting our backs this entire time,\" and \"When we get in trouble and the system isn't working for us, they're the ones out there marching and protesting.\"\n\nMr. Obama's pleas didn't move the needle for Ms. Harris. President Trump nearly doubled his support among Black voters in 2024 from his 2020 results, increasing from 5% to 10% among women and from 12% to 21% among men, according to a Pew Research analysis.\n\nInterestingly, Mr. Obama isn't making the same argument on behalf of Winsome Earle-Sears, a Black Republican and U.S. Marine Corps veteran running for Virginia governor. However, lacking a clear leader of the Democratic Party, Mr. Obama is stepping up his visibility in November's political races, believing he still has the influence to sway voters on the campaign trail.\n\nThat gamble may backfire. The hope and change Mr. Obama ran and won on in 2008 and 2012 didn't result in a better America.\n\nMr. Obama's signature health care achievement, the Affordable Care Act, continues to need repeated taxpayer bailouts because of its unaffordability. His focus on racial bias fostered an anti-police climate, which led to communities becoming less safe. His economic policies led to a slow recovery for many working- and middle-class families, stagnant wages and a drop in the labor force participation rate to its lowest point since the 1970s. Mr. Obama's foreign policy of \"leading from behind\" led to a more bellicose Iran and emboldened Russia to invade Ukraine.\n\nSince Mr. Obama's departure from political office, his speeches have become less inspiring and more condescending and patronizing. He consistently blames American voters for not recognizing his achievements or being able to move beyond their racial, sexist and moral biases. He wasn't able to boost Democratic turnout in 2024, yet he believes he can sway voters a year later.\n\nFour days ago, Mr. Obama joined California Gov. Gavin Newsom to promote California Democrats' redistricting effort. This Saturday, he is set to rally with Virginia's Democratic gubernatorial candidate, Abigail Spanberger, in Norfolk, and New Jersey's gubernatorial candidate, Mikie Sherrill, in Newark.\n\nMr. Obama has decided to enter a more \"political and public-facing role than he once envisioned\" this year, The Washington Post reported last week, because of the \"anxieties he harbors about Trump's second term.\"\n\n\"The ex-president has grown especially worried that some lawmakers and voters are not confronting Trump with the same urgency they showed during his first term -- and that major institutions, including universities and law firms, have too often capitulated to Trump's demands, said a person familiar with [Mr. Obama's] thinking,\" The Post reported.\n\nOn a podcast this month, Mr. Obama said Mr. Trump's policies have led to \"masked folks with rifles and machine guns patrolling our streets\" and \"kangaroo courts and trumped-up charges.\" He said there needed to be \"a few folks standing up and giving courage to other folks.\" He decried that the country is \"being tested right now\" and urged people to \"take a stand.\"\n\nRich, coming from Mr. Obama, who, during his tenure, targeted conservative organizations through the IRS, used the Espionage Act to put a record number of reporters' sources in jail and green-lit his intelligence agencies to investigate the 2016 Trump campaign's (phony) ties to Russia.\n\nInstead of building up a new generation of Democratic leaders, Mr. Obama's administration obliterated the party while he served in the White House. During his presidency, the Democratic Party lost a net total of 13 governorships and 816 state legislative seats, the most of any president since Dwight D. Eisenhower.\n\nSo, as a Republican, I welcome Mr. Obama's renewed presence in the public domain. He paved the way for Mr. Trump's ascendency but is still too arrogant, nearly a decade later, to even contemplate the thought.",

        "title": "Indiana's GOP governor says he will call a special session on redistricting",
        "description": "Caroline Linton is an associate managing editor on the political team for CBSNews.com. She has previously written for The Daily Beast, Newsweek and amNewYork.\n\nIndiana's Republican governor on Monday said he would be calling a special session to consider redrawing the state's congressional map, following in the footsteps of other GOP states -- although the state Senate president cautioned that \"the votes still aren't there.\"\n\nGov. Mike Braun posted on X that he will be \"calling a special legislative session to protect Hoosiers from efforts in other states that seek to diminish their voice in Washington and ensure their representation in Congress is fair.\" He said the special session will work to conform \"Indiana's tax code with new federal tax provisions.\"\n\nThe session is set to start on Nov. 3 and by law it can only run for 30 session days, or 40 calendar days. Indiana currently has seven Republicans and two Democrats in Congress, and the Republicans are hoping to change the district lines to edge out the two Democrats.\n\nFiling for the 2026 midterm elections begins on Jan. 7 and closes on Feb. 6, with the primaries scheduled for May 5 -- which would give candidates only a few months to campaign under new district lines.\n\nRepublicans have a supermajority in both chambers, but Indiana Senate President Rodric Bray's office said in a statement Monday morning that \"the votes still aren't there for redistricting.\"\n\nSenate Democratic Leader Shelli Yoder said in a statement that Democrats will fight the \"illegitimate session with every tool, every vote and every ounce of moral clarity we have.\"\n\nPresident Trump won Indiana by 19 points, but there has been hesitation from Republican lawmakers on redrawing the state's congressional lines, which were set in 2021. Republican leaders have met with Mr. Trump at the White House, and Vice President JD Vance has visited Indiana at least twice and also met with Republican lawmakers in D.C.\n\nRepublicans have been seeking to redistrict in red states nationwide as Mr. Trump has tried to solidify the GOP majority in the House. Over the summer, Mr. Trump called on Texas Republicans to redraw their congressional maps to give the party up to five seats. That push garnered national attention, especially when Democrats in the state legislature fled the state to deny Republicans a quorum, dragging the issue into a second session until it eventually succeeded.\n\nIn response, California's Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, pushed an effort to redraw his state's congressional districts to garner up to five seats for Democrats. A new map was passed by the Democratic-controlled Assembly, and it now will go before voters on Nov. 4 as a ballot measure known as Proposition 50. A CBS News poll conducted between Oct. 16 and 21 found that 62% of California voters plan to support it.\n\nOther Republican-led states have taken on redistricting efforts, even though the net outcome would just be one seat in each state. Missouri lawmakers approved a new map in September to edge out longtime Democratic Rep. Emanuel Cleaver in Kansas City, and North Carolina followed earlier this month with the General Assembly passing a map intended to force out Rep. Don Davis.\n\nDemocrats have filed lawsuits against many of these efforts.",

        "description": "Fox News correspondent Christina Coleman reports on former Vice President Kamala Harris' book tour and interview with the BBC on 'Fox News Live.'\n\nCalifornia Democrat Gov. Gavin Newsom and former Vice President Kamala Harris both remarked in the past few days that they're keeping their options open for potential 2028 presidential runs.\n\n\"Yeah, I'd be lying otherwise,\" Newsom told \"CBS News Sunday Morning\" when asked if he would give \"serious thought\" to a 2028 presidential run after the 2026 midterms. \"I'd just be lying. And I'm not -- I can't do that.\"\n\n\"I have no idea,\" Newsom said of whether he would decide to run, adding that he has not let academic struggles from across his life prevent him from working to ascend the political ladder. \"The idea that a guy who got 960 on his SAT, that still struggles to read scripts, that was always in the back of the classroom, the idea that you would even throw that out is, in and of itself, extraordinary. Who the hell knows? I'm looking forward to who presents themselves in 2028 and who meets that moment. And that's the question for the American people.\"\n\nNewsom long has been floated as a likely Democrat nominee for the presidency, most notably after the unprecedented 2024 race when President Joe Biden dropped out of the running amid heightened concerns over his mental acuity, and then-Vice President Harris took up the mantle in his absence. President Donald Trump ultimately swept the seven battleground states and won the popular vote and the Electoral College.\n\nGOV. GAVIN NEWSOM REVEALS WHEN HE'LL START THINKING ABOUT A POTENTIAL 2028 RUN\n\nHarris also left the door open to a potential 2028 presidential run while speaking with the BBC in an interview that aired Saturday. Harris is a longtime California Democrat who has served as San Francisco district attorney, the California attorney general, and a U.S. senator representing California before ascending the political landscape as the nation's vice president in 2021.\n\n\"I am not done,\" Harris told the UK outlet. \"I have lived my entire career as a life of service, and it's in my bones.\"\n\nHarris said during the interview that her grand-nieces would see the first female president \"in their lifetime, for sure,\" and that she could \"possibly\" be that woman, according to the BBC.\n\nHarris brushed off polling that shows her as a 2028 Democrat outsider, saying during the interview that she historically has not listened to polling data.\n\nKAMALA HARRIS TO PUBLISH BEHIND-THE-SCENES ACCOUNT OF FAILED 2024 CAMPAIGN\n\n\"If I listened to polls I would have not run for my first office, or my second office -- and I certainly wouldn't be sitting here.\"\n\nThe 2024 presidential election threw the Democrat Party into a tailspin as it continues searching for its next de facto leader. Harris published a memoir in September detailing her 107 days on the campaign trail after Biden dropped out of the race, which included a handful of shots at the former president that has caused rifts within the party to grow deeper as it looks for fresh leadership.\n\nKAMALA HARRIS' MAJOR CALIFORNIA ANNOUNCEMENT TRIGGERS CIRCULAR DEM FIRING SQUAD\n\nBoth Newsom and Harris are longtime political foes of Trump, who has railed against both of them for promoting left-wing West Coast policies, including on the national stage.\n\nTrump, who is term limited and in the midst of his second presidency, welcomed a potential Newsom presidential run back in May, but said the California high-speed rail project intended to connect San Francisco and Los Angeles would prevent him from proceeding in a presidential race.\n\n\"I would love him to run for president,\" he said. \"I'd love to see that, but I don't think he's going to be running because that one project alone -- well, that, and the fires and a lot of other things -- pretty much put him out of the race.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe \"one project alone\" refers to the high-speed rail project that has been plagued by delays and increased costs, with the Trump administration pulling the funding plug on the project in July.\n\nFox News Digital reached out to Newsom's and Harris' respective offices Monday morning for additional comment on their 2028 remarks and has yet to receive replies.",

But as it turns out, there's another group of people who will be monitoring the process in an entirely different way. The Associated Press reported:\n\nThe Justice Department approved the monitoring of polling sites, not in response to a specific problem or evidence of irregularities, but in response to requests from state Republican Party officials.\n\nIt's important to emphasize that DOJ election monitoring is not altogether uncommon, but there is a broader context to consider. A spokesperson for California Gov. Gavin Newsom, for example, told The New York Times, \"This administration has made no secret of its goal to undermine free and fair elections. Deploying these federal forces appears to be an intimidation tactic meant for one thing: suppress the vote.\"\n\nThose concerns were bolstered two days later, when Donald Trump, without a shred of evidence, claimed via his social media platform that balloting in California is \"totally dishonest.\"\n\nAnd while such accusations are obviously ridiculous, consider the related data points from recent weeks:\n\nIn isolation, each of these stories matters, but taken together, we're talking about what appears to be a multifaceted campaign against elections, launched by a president whose contempt for the democratic process is unsubtle.\n\nWith a year remaining before the 2026 midterm elections, there is every reason to believe this offensive will only get worse in the coming months.",

It asks the court to prevent the laws from going into effect next year.\n\nIn its complaint, ExxonMobil says it has for years publicly disclosed its greenhouse gas emissions and climate-related business risks, but it fundamentally disagrees with the state's new reporting requirements.\n\nThe company would have to use \"frameworks that place disproportionate blame on large companies like ExxonMobil\" for the purpose of shaming such companies, the complaint states.\n\nUnder Senate Bill 253 , large businesses will have to disclose a wide range of planet-warming emissions, including both direct and indirect emissions such as the costs of employee business travel and product transport.\n\nExxonMobil takes issue with the methodology required by the state, which would focus on a company's emissions worldwide and therefore fault businesses just for being large as opposed to being efficient, the complaint states.\n\nThe second law, Senate Bill 261, requires companies making more than $500 million annually to disclose the financial risks that climate change poses to their businesses and how they plan to address them.\n\nThe company said in its complaint that the law would require it to speculate \"about unknowable future developments\" and post such speculations on its website.\n\nA spokesperson for the office of California Gov.

On the totem pole of the fight with Gavin Newsom, I don't think the gerrymander fight is top three.\"\n\nFormer Rep. Mimi Walters (R-CA) claimed the issue is bigger than just California. \"I think what the Republicans are trying to do is make this a local issue. What the Democrats are trying to do is make this a national issue,\" she explained. \"Unfortunately for Republicans, there's not as many Republicans as there are Democrats in our state and the Democrats have the money behind them on Prop 50.\"\n\nA Californian with close ties to the state's GOP leadership agreed, telling Politico, \"I assume Kevin McCarthy and President Trump are aligned, but the White House's lack of engagement at this point is an indication that the 'No' campaign is struggling.\"\n\nThat individual lamented that Trump may have given up too early\n\n\"Two weeks ago, if President Trump had been more active, and excited the 20 percent of solid MAGA voters in California, it may have made a difference in this low turnout election,\" that source suggested.",

        "title": "USDA announces no federal SNAP benefits will be delivered over...",
        "description": "The US Department of Agriculture warned Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits will not go out on Nov. 1 -- disrupting food access nationwide as the government shutdown drags on.\n\nThe department posted a notice with the grim announcement after the Trump administration said it would not tap roughly $5 billion in contingency funds to keep SNAP benefits flowing into November, raising the stakes for nearly 42 million Americans who receive assistance through the program every month.\n\nThe announcement blamed Senate Democrats for holding up the program also known as food stamps.\n\n\"Bottom line, the well has run dry,\" the USDA notice said.\n\n\"At this time, there will be no benefits issued November 01. We are approaching an inflection point for Senate Democrats,\" the statement continued.\n\nSNAP benefits were safe in October because states received federal funding before the government shutdown began on Oct. 1.\n\nThe Trump administration has pinned the dire impacts of the shutdown on Democrats, arguing the party will not agree to reopen the government until Republicans negotiate with them on extending expiring subsidies under the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\"They can continue to hold out for healthcare for illegal aliens and gender mutilation procedures or reopen the government so mothers, babies, and the most vulnerable among us can receive critical nutrition assistance,\" the USDA notice raved.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers have written to Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins requesting that the government use contingency funds to cover most of November's benefits.\n\nA USDA memo that surfaced Friday maintained that \"contingency funds are not legally available to cover regular benefits,\" and cited major hurricane Melissa as a reason to reserve funds for people in disaster areas.\n\nSome states already announced plans to suspend SNAP payments next month, while others have agreed to temporarily foot the bill for benefits.\n\n\"If you have accrued SNAP benefits from previous months on your account, use those funds now to buy shelf-stable foods that can last through November and beyond,\" the Arkansas Department of Human Services states on its website.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom deployed 30 National Guard troops at the Los Angeles Regional Food Bank this week to sort fresh produce and packaged meals ahead of the benefit disruption, KABC reported.\n\nRepublican Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin declared a state of emergency to provide food benefits to SNAP beneficiaries and encouraged residents to support local nonprofits by donating food.\n\nOther states have encouraged residents to locate food banks and stock up on goods to carry them through the next month.\n\nThe USDA memo also maintained that states promising their residents a continuation of benefits would not be reimbursed for doing so.\n\nLower-income families who qualify for SNAP receive debit cards loaded each month by the federal government to load up on groceries at participating stores.\n\nThe average monthly benefit is $187 per person, often handed out to those with incomes at or below the poverty level.\n\nSen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) blasted Republicans and President Trump Sunday for not agreeing to negotiate and end the shutdown on CNN's \"State of the Union.\n\n\"The reality is, if they sat down to try to negotiate, we could probably come up with something pretty quickly,\" Murphy said.\n\n\"We could open up the government on Tuesday or Wednesday, and there wouldn't be any crisis in the food stamp program.\"",

        "title": "National Women's Soccer League must adopt gender standards to keep...",
        "description": "When I joined the National Women's Soccer League 11 years ago, our games were livestreamed to fans on YouTube. Today, our league is halfway through a four-year, $240 million television contract. Our teams are among the most valuable franchises in women's sports. Yet with this remarkable growth comes an urgent challenge: How do we preserve women's rights and competitive fairness while fostering meaningful inclusion?\n\nI'm proud to have played a small role in our league's transformation from struggling startup to supercharged celebrity-maker. I've been a part of winning seven titles: three NWSL Championships, three regular-season titles and one International Champions Cup. But I'm concerned that without clarity about who the league is for, it will lose its identity and its momentum.\n\nRecent controversies across women's sports -- from swimming to track and field -- have highlighted professional soccer lacks clear eligibility policies, unlike a growing number of other competitions.\n\nThis uncertainty serves no one, as questions and controversy abound over intersex and transgender athletes.\n\nPlayers have been excluded and then unexcluded, administrators have blamed and criticized each other, and fans have used the uncertainty to harass players.\n\nLeaders from across the political spectrum, including progressives like California Gov. Gavin Newsom and former Vice President Kamala Harris, have expressed support for stronger protections for the integrity of women's sports. Ensuring fairness prompted numerous international leagues to tighten eligibility. World Athletics did so in 2023 for international track and field competitions. Other countries' domestic organizations did the same, including the UK Athletics Federation. World Aquatics (formerly FINA), international swimming's governing body, adopted clear rules about sex and gender eligibility in 2022. England's Football Association now requires ovaries at birth.\n\nAddressing this challenge entails remembering why women's sports categories exist in the first place: not to exclude but to create a space where female athletes can physically compete on equal footing. Studies show measurable differences between men and women in muscle mass, bone density and cardiovascular capacity, which directly affect competitive outcomes. Further research has found male muscular advantage is only \"minimally reduced\" -- by about 5% over 12 months -- by testosterone suppression.\n\nFairness and inclusion are core American values. Reasonable people can disagree about where to draw lines, but avoiding the conversation altogether by shutting out diverse views does not serve us. In fact, we owe it to current and future female athletes to solve this.\n\nThe NWSL must adopt a clear standard. One option is all players must be born with ovaries, as the FA requires. Another option is an SRY gene test, like those World Athletics and World Boxing implemented.\n\nThis SRY genetic marker indicates male-developmental pathways during fetal growth, providing objective scientific criteria for competitive categorization. Critics say genetic-testing policies can cause psychological harm. This concern must be taken seriously. Testing could easily integrate into medical evaluations through existing blood draws or noninvasive cheek swabs, conducted once per career under strict confidentiality protocols. Athletes testing positive for the SRY gene could receive comprehensive support, including counseling, privacy protections and inclusion in professional networks. World Athletics has successfully used similar protocols since 2018, with legal challenges ultimately supporting such policies' scientific basis.\n\nCreating pathways for athletes traditionally excluded from competing at the highest level would demonstrate inclusion and competitive integrity can coexist.\n\nI know from experience the NWSL is more than just a sports league. For many, dreams are coming true in real life -- dreams that were impossible before my generation. I also understand that for many athletes and fans, seeing intersex and transgender athletes compete and dominate on sports' biggest stages also realizes a dream. How can we make an open arena reality for small and tragically marginalized minorities with nowhere else that may feel safe and inclusive to compete?\n\nThe answer is in the NWSL's own history. Just as we built a new space for women to compete in the largest arenas, now we must honor that commitment and make the National Women's Soccer League for women. I welcome leaders including the aforementioned American politicians to come together with the NWSL's blueprint and build solutions.\n\nSome pathway ideas: an open division within the NWSL, small-sided opportunities like the Soccer Tournament and World Sevens Football, pathways to stay in the game and free counseling. I don't have all the answers, but I do know we're all in this together. It will take time, space and creativity to cooperate as we move forward.\n\nDecisions the NWSL makes -- or shirks its responsibility to make -- will shape opportunities for young athletes of all backgrounds for decades to come. We must get them right by finding the most ethical and innovative path ahead.\n\nWomen's sports showcase the full range of human ability as we reach and exceed what's physically possible. Everybody needs a chance to break records and achieve the previously impossible. That's why we love to celebrate women competing against each other and why we need creative solutions to ensure everybody can compete on a level playing field.\n\nIt would be nice to have no need for clear eligibility criteria. Unfortunately, when money, power and fame are at stake, which inevitably happens in professional sports, competitors may try to push on what is right or fair. Especially when the goal of winning requires using every available advantage.",

        "title": "How Politics Is Changing the Way History Is Taught",
        "description": "History lessons are being wiped from the internet, and California is retreating from ethnic studies, as education swings away from curriculums that are seen as too progressive.\n\nIn the Trump era, history and civics education are under a microscope.\n\nSeveral major curriculum publishers have withdrawn products from the market, while others have found that teachers are shying away from lessons that were once uncontroversial, on topics as basic as constitutional limits on executive power.\n\nCalifornia, the nation's largest Democratic-led state, has passed a law restricting what teachers can say in the classroom, and has walked back an effort to require high school students to take classes in ethnic studies.\n\nTo supporters of these changes, they are a necessary corrective to what they see as a leftward tilt in the education establishment. But these developments have also set off alarms among free speech advocates, as the Trump administration pushes to punish speech it dislikes and to impose its patriotic vision of American history on schools.\n\nAdam Laats, a historian of education at Binghamton University, noted that school curriculum had been restricted before, notably during the Red Scares of the last century. But the current political pressure is unique, he said: \"Never before has this kind of fervor from the right owned the Oval Office.\"\n\nAs recently as last year, many social studies teachers reported success in withstanding political pressure. Now, there is growing evidence that the landscape is shifting. In a September poll, more than half of the teachers who responded said that political pressure had caused them to modify their curriculums or classroom discussions, a sharp increase from March.\n\nChristopher Rufo, a conservative activist who has led the push for changes in education, said President Trump's return to office accelerated a cultural shift that was already underway. Over the last five years, more than 20 states have passed laws restricting classroom discussions on race, gender and American history.\n\n\"Even center-left Democrats are starting to pull away from left-wing ideologies they had endorsed a few years before,\" he said. \"The reason for this is quite simple. America has a center-right culture and the gap between the public and these elite ideologies became a political liability.\"\n\nLesson Plans Are Disappearing\n\nThis spring, as Brown University was under intense pressure from the Trump administration, it shuttered Choices, the university's 30-year-old high school social studies curriculum, overseen by its history department.\n\nChoices reached one million students annually, and was especially popular in advanced courses and at independent private schools. The program was known for bringing college-level concepts into high schools and for lesson plans that were rich in primary sources, on topics from the American Revolution to the riot at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nAfter the start of the Israel-Hamas War in 2023 and the rise of the pro-Palestinian campus protest movement -- which was heavily active at Brown -- Choices was scrutinized by advocacy groups supportive of Israel. Critics argued that a unit on the Middle East fed antisemitism by focusing on Israel's occupation of Palestinian land and downplaying Palestinian terrorism against Israelis.\n\nNow Choices materials have largely been wiped from the internet.\n\nBrown had been reconsidering Choices since the summer of 2024 for budgetary reasons. The final decision to shutter the program was made this past spring, as Brown faced a potential federal funding freeze. The White House eventually moved to withhold $510 million in grants, accusing Brown of allowing antisemitism to fester during campus protests. (The university has since made a deal with the government to restore its funding.)\n\nBrian Clark, a Brown spokesman, said the closure of Choices was based \"exclusively\" on the program's financial outlook, and had nothing to do with debates over its content or pressure from the White House. He acknowledged in an email, however, that the market for Choices materials had weakened, in part because of \"recent pressures to eliminate curricula that consider race, gender, colonialism, etc.\"\n\nBrown decided not to allow other publishers to acquire Choices lesson plans, according to internal communications reviewed by The New York Times. It also declined to maintain the Choices archives on the university's website, and refused to allow the program's staff to distribute over $200,000 worth of lesson plans that had already been printed.\n\nDoing so would have created \"legal and financial exposure,\" Mr. Clark said.\n\nHigh school teachers, worried about losing access to materials that they relied on for years, have used social media to circulate some Choices units.\n\nAnother group that has withdrawn curriculum is the Anti-Defamation League, a nonprofit that historically focused on antisemitism and a broad range of other civil rights issues, while also strongly supporting Israel. The A.D.L.'s educational resources reach more than 1.6 million students annually, according to Todd Gutnick, a spokesman for the group.\n\nOver the past two years, the A.D.L. has removed dozens of lesson plans from its website, according to a review of archived web content. Some were about transgender identity, sexism against women who have run for president and sexist tropes in video games.\n\nThe deleted lessons also included several that dealt with police violence against Black men, one on microaggressions, and a lesson on Frederick Douglass and voting rights.\n\nIn a written statement, Mr. Gutnick said that some of the lessons had been retired and others were \"temporarily removed\" for revisions.\n\nA statement on the A.D.L.'s website says the group is choosing to focus its educational resources on antisemitism, the Holocaust and Jewish identity. \"While we are no longer hosting many of our broader anti-bias resources, we remain deeply committed to fostering inclusive school communities,\" it states.\n\nLast year, the group phased out a 40-year-old program for schools called A World of Difference Institute, which sought to \"actively challenge prejudice, stereotyping and all forms of discrimination.\"\n\nThe A.D.L. continues to offer No Place for Hate, an anti-bullying curriculum that includes material on identity-based bias.\n\nTeachers Are Avoiding Basic Civics\n\nThe organization iCivics was founded by Sandra Day O'Connor, the former Supreme Court justice, to provide free, nonpartisan curriculum materials. The group estimates that its lessons reach about nine million students annually.\n\nThis fall, though, staff members noted a significant decline -- up to 28 percent -- in the number of page views recorded for some popular lessons, including those dealing with separation of powers, consent of the governed and other constitutional principles.\n\niCivics does not yet have a full picture of why this is happening.\n\nBut Emma Humphries, the group's chief education officer, said that in her travels across the country to train teachers, many have said they were fearful of having classroom discussions veer into politically fraught territory -- like questions from students about why Mr. Trump appeared to be violating constitutional norms.\n\nSocial studies teachers typically receive much less training from their school districts than teachers of English and math, the subjects covered by state tests. As a result, some teachers may have had little guidance on how to tackle controversial topics.\n\nFurther complicating matters, many teachers work in states that have adopted broadly written laws that limit what can be said in the classroom.\n\niCivics offers training in how to teach students about American government without walking into political minefields, including by using primary sources like the Constitution and Supreme Court rulings. Dr. Humphries said teachers should explain to students that questions like the limits of presidential power have been debated for centuries, and that presidents from all parties have tried to stretch the limits to increase their authority.\n\n\"The concern is that teachers will avoid certain topics altogether, or just revert to boring pedagogy, like reading the textbook the district approved,\" she said. \"That is not a good way to teach. The kids deserve better than that, and our democracy deserves better.\"\n\nA Democratic-Led State Shifts Right\n\nCalifornia was once a leader in adopting a left-leaning approach to social studies. In 2021, Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a law requiring all high school students to take a course in ethnic studies, an activist discipline that focuses on the histories and cultures of Latinos, Black Americans, Asian Americans and Native Americans. Ethnic studies lessons often criticize settler colonialism, naming Israel as the prime contemporary example.\n\nResearch has shown that ethnic studies classes can raise attendance and grades for students who are at risk of dropping out.\n\nBut after some Jewish groups mounted a legal and political fight against ethnic studies -- saying its critiques of Israel were fostering antisemitism -- the consensus around the state's mandate unraveled. This spring, Mr. Newsom presented and signed a budget that did not include funding for the classes. Districts are not currently required to offer the course, according to the state board of education.\n\nIn some school systems that are continuing to offer ethnic studies, there are new restrictions. San Francisco teachers must use a single textbook that does not discuss the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Supplemental materials must be approved by administrators.\n\nMr. Newsom signed two bills this month that were intended to prevent antisemitism and other forms of discrimination in schools. The laws establish a state office to handle complaints, and require teachers to abstain from \"advocacy, opinion, bias or partisanship\" in the classroom.\n\nTeachers' unions, the American Civil Liberties Union and Muslim groups raised concerns about the potential for chilled speech and increased litigation. But the bills passed unanimously in the heavily Democratic legislature.\n\nMr. Rufo, the conservative activist, argued that the new laws do not threaten free speech, noting that public-school teachers do not have a legal right to academic freedom in their classrooms.\n\nKairi Hand, a 15-year-old sophomore at Burton Academic High School in San Francisco, said ethnic studies had been a favorite course. Israel was not a focus in her class, she recalled. What stayed with her, she said, were lessons on the Chinese Exclusion Act and the way in which the Disney movie \"Pocahontas\" differed from the true history of English encounters with Indigenous Americans.\n\nShe also understood why the class was controversial. \"There is a lot of controversy going on in the whole world. Especially,\" she said, \"things taught in schools.\"",

        "title": "Miranda Devine: Trump Derangement Syndrome has morphed into something...",
        "description": "This time last year, the conversation was about what is the acceptable number of apartment complexes in Colorado that we can tolerate being taken over by Venezuelan gangs of illegal migrants.\n\nNow the big issue is the president's big, beautiful ballroom. The \"No Kings\" folk are melting down.\n\nIn just two days last week, there were 10,000 comments on The Washington Post's website railing against the ballroom, which is being built at a cost to the taxpayer of zero dollars.\n\n\"I can't wait for the day they hold Trump's funeral in that gaudy ballroom,\" was a typical \"recommended\" comment from someone calling herself CindyintheSuburbs.\n\nThis time around, it's morphed into something far more lethal. Like a wounded animal that's been cornered, electorally challenged Democrats are desperate and dangerous. They make TDS look like a quaint affectation.\n\nIn the spirit of \"If you can't beat him, join him,\" they're trying to imitate Trump, but they're imitating a foul-mouthed cartoon villain version of a Hitlerian dictator that they have convinced themselves he is.\n\nTDS Redux has become Trump Projection Disorder. Everything they've accused him of being they've now become, Nazi tattoos and all.\n\nIn Maine, they are running a Senate candidate who had a skull-and-crossbones Nazi death symbol tattooed onto his chest, described himself as an \"Antifa supersoldier\" and reportedly recruited and trained members of a far-left paramilitary group, The Socialist Rifle Association, which has links to Charlie Kirk's alleged assassin.\n\nWhile Democrats and their media handmaidens try to portray Graham \"I'm not a secret Nazi\" Platner as a plainspoken MAGA-coded \"Maine Oyster Farmer,\" he's just the usual sham impersonator. In fact, he is a child of privilege who attended The Hotchkiss School, a boarding prep school in Connecticut where tuition costs more than $75,000 a year.\n\nBut the party that launched cancel culture is standing by him. Bernie Sanders says his Nazi tattoo is a distraction: \"I think what we have got to do as a nation is not focus on a tattoo,\" he told Axios last week.\n\nSure enough, Platner remains the front-runner in the Democratic primary. The latest polls have him 34 points ahead of Maine governor Janet Mills.\n\nIn Virginia, Dems are running a candidate as the state's attorney general who said he wanted to murder a Republican lawmaker and his small children. That \u00adGOPer is no longer in politics.\n\nBut Jay Jones is still on the Democratic ticket to be Virginia's top cop alongside gubernatorial aspirant Abigail Spanberger, who won't say a bad word about him, let alone disavow his candidacy.\n\nThe ex-CIA operative is running against the black Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, and the NAACP is backing the white woman.\n\nIn New York, the Democrat most likely to become mayor posed proudly with a radical imam and purported unindicted coconspirator in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing who has called for jihad in \"garbage can\" America ever since.\n\nZohran Mamdani described Siraj Wahhaj as a \"pillar\" of the community in his social media post. But the Uganda-born democratic socialist has been shedding crocodile tears all week because he caught a little blowback for his embrace of the terror apologist just 24 years after 9/11 traumatized the city he aims to lead.\n\n\"Islamophobia is something that is endemic to politics across this country,\" Mamdani complained to MSNBC over the weekend.\n\n\"And we have seen it normalized. We have seen it accepted.\"\n\nPoor Zohran. He aimed a giant middle finger at all the New Yorkers who died on 9/11, but he's the victim.\n\nThe only other victim of 9/11 he bothered mentioning was an aunt who he claimed \"stopped taking the subway after 9/11 because she did not feel safe in her hijab.\"\n\nIt's clear that Mamdani is the future of the Democratic Party. No doubt there are dozens of Zohran clones being cultivated around the country who will be stationed in irredeemably blue cities where they can white-ant the country they despise from within.\n\nIf that's not bad enough, Karine Jean-Pierre, on her Seinfeldian book tour about nothing, is signaling she may go into politics. Black women are the \"backbone\" of the Democratic Party, she declared, and they aren't getting enough attention.\n\nActually, it gets worse. Democrats are grooming AOC to run for president in 2028.\n\nUnlike Mamdani, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez once had a real job, albeit briefly, as a bartender.\n\nThe other night grandpa Sanders had to coach her through a 90-minute town hall with a pliable CNN host. The good news is that she's clearly not ready for prime time if she can't handle Kaitlan Collins by herself.\n\nMeanwhile, in Washington, Democrats have shut down the government for almost a month for no reason. They have offered no compromise plan on health insurance, which they belatedly pretend is their justification for denying pay checks to air traffic controllers and SNAP benefits to the poor.\n\nAs polls turn against them, they pump out F-bombs on TikTok and stand firm in their childish nihilism.\n\nDems from Chuck Schumer to Gavin Newsom are endeavoring to ape Trump's trash-talking style, mistaking profanity for authenticity.\n\nNewsom mimics Trump's uniquely punchy Truth Social posts, complete with Capitalized Words and Exclamation Points!!\n\nHe even has a merch line, including red hats saying \"Newsom was Right about Everything.\"\n\nIt comes across as flattery rather than irony.\n\nTrump offered a wry critique of the Dems' copycat efforts last week.\n\n\"They are trying so hard and it's not working,\" he said.\n\n\"They want to imitate me, and they start using foul language, but they use too much of it.\n\n\"You can't use the F-word seven times in one sentence. It doesn't work. It might work every seven news conferences, but you can't do it .\u2009.\u2009. seven times in one sentence. .\u2009.\u2009. They're in big trouble, that party.\"\n\nTrump's successes are due to common-sense policies and the courage to carry them out, along with an uncontrollable nature, an iron will and a knack for comedic showmanship.\n\nBecause they refuse to see him for what he is, Democrats are taking the opposite of the right lessons from him. If they keep on this track, they are destined to drive themselves even further round the bend.",

        "title": "Arnold Schwarzenegger slams Gavin Newsom's claim that California's...",
        "description": "Former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger dismissed current Gov. Gavin Newsom's argument that the proposed redistricting in the state was temporary, calling the notion \"total fantasy.\"\n\n\"I think when he -- when they say this is temporary, there is no such thing. I mean, the longest programs are government programs that are temporary. Okay, just remember that if this is a tax program or if it is the redistricting program, anything that is temporary with government is permanent,\" he told CNN's Jake Tapper on \"State of the Union,\" responding to a clip of Newsom touting his Proposition 50 legislation that would reshape congressional seats.\n\nVoting opened last week to add as many as five Democrat-held seats in Congress, which could possibly offset President Donald Trump's moves in Texas and elsewhere to help Republicans in the 2026 election. Obama endorsed Prop 50 this week.\n\n\"In the year 2032 when the independent redistricting commission is supposed to come back, they're going to say, 'Wait a minute. There's still gerrymandering going on in Texas. There's still gerrymandering going on in Ohio. There's still gerrymandering going on in Florida. We have to continue with gerrymandering.' This is what's going to happen. They will find an excuse. So therefore I don't think it is temporary. So that's total fantasy,\" Schwarzenegger said.\n\nNewsom issued a response to those who oppose Proposition 50 and said, \"Spare me the moral high ground.\"\n\nSchwarzenegger called the redistricting efforts cheating, and said Democrats needed to outperform Trump.\n\n\"What the Democrats should do is they should outperform Trump. To me, it's all about competition creates performance. And so what they do is with the redistricting commission is that they're going to go and try to draw the district lines in such a way that they get voted in, no matter if they work well or not for the American people. So the American people get cheated on this whole thing. That is really the problem here,\" he said.\n\nThe former Republican California governor said that he understood Republicans and Democrats needed to \"fight\" about it, but argued that Americans were being cheated.\n\n\"I think that if you want to really fight for democracy, why would you go in, destroy the Constitution in California, tear it up and redo it, do the whole thing? So to me, it just doesn't make any sense at all,\" he added.\n\nSchwarzenegger has come out against the redistricting efforts in a post on social media, where he posted a photo of himself at the gym wearing a t-shirt that read \"terminate gerrymandering.\"\n\nThe former governor also told CNN that he and Newsom were friendly and spoke about the issue. Schwarzenegger said they've been speaking out about it without attacking one another.",

The order was lifted at about 10:30 a.m., but the FAA had warned that there was a chance of extension.\n\nThe ground stop only impacted flights between Los Angeles and Oakland, but travelers experienced a total of over 900 minutes in delays, the FAA said in its advisory. Average flight delays were around 49 minutes, and some flights were delayed for up to 87 minutes, according to the FAA.\n\nAfter flights were resumed, the FAA said it was likely delays could continue and that travelers were advised to monitor the status of their flights. The temporary ground stop came after U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy warned that flight disruptions would increase in the coming days, as air traffic controllers will miss their first full paycheck on Oct. 28 amid the federal government shutdown.\n\nDuffy told Fox News' \"Sunday Morning Futures\" program that the FAA had 22 \"triggers\" on Oct. 25 that indicated shortages of air traffic controllers. He called that figure \"one of the highest that we've seen in the system\" since Oct. 1.\n\n\"That's a sign that the controllers are wearing thin,\" Duffy said.\n\nEarlier this month, Duffy said the government shutdown was adding stress to already overworked and understaffed air traffic controllers. He previously said air traffic control facilities have seen an uptick in controllers calling in sick, with some missing as many as 50% of employees on any given day since the shutdown started on Oct. 1.\n\nNewsom blames Trump administration for lack of air traffic controllers\n\nIn response to the temporary ground stop at Los Angeles International Airport, California Gov. Gavin Newsom's office blamed the disruption on the Trump administration.\n\n\"Hell of a job, @SecDuffy,\" Newsom's press office wrote on X, sharing a news article about the ground stop. \"Can't wait to see what you do with NASA.\"\n\nEarlier this month, Newsom criticized President Donald Trump for the lack of air traffic controllers at the Hollywood Burbank Airport in Los Angeles County. On Oct. 6, the FAA said the air traffic control tower for the Burbank Airport would be unmanned due to staffing shortages.\n\n\"Thanks, @realDonaldTrump! Burbank Airport has ZERO air traffic controllers from 4:15 p.m. to 10 p.m. today because of YOUR government shutdown,\" the governor wrote in a social media post on Oct. 6.\n\nStaffing shortages cause disruptions at several U.S. airports\n\nAccording to FlightAware, a flight tracking website, there were more than 5,400 U.S. flight delays on Oct. 25 and more than 5,700 by 3 p.m. local time on Oct. 26. Delays have often been above average since the shutdown began. Weather issues have also impacted flights.\n\nBy noon ET on Oct. 26, the FAA had recorded shortfalls in air traffic controllers at six U.S. airports.\n\nStaffing shortages caused disruptions on Oct. 26 at Newark Liberty International Airport and Teteboro Airport in New Jersey, according to the FAA. The agency also said air traffic control staffing issues were reported for Chicago flights.\n\nTransportation Secretary Duffy says controllers are looking for other sources of income\n\nDuring Fox News' \"Sunday Morning Futures\" program, Duffy predicted that more air traffic controller shortages will lead to an increase in flight delays and cancellations over the next few days.\n\nAir traffic controllers received a paycheck two weeks ago at 90% of their regular pay, but will miss their first full paycheck on Oct. 28. Controllers facing the prospect of missing a federal paycheck are looking for other sources of income, Duffy said.\n\n\"They're taking second jobs, they're out there looking,\" he said.\n\nAround 13,000 air traffic controllers and about 50,000 Transportation Security Administration officers must work even if they are not being paid during the shutdown. The FAA is about 3,500 air traffic controllers short of targeted staffing levels and many had been working mandatory overtime and six-day weeks even before the shutdown.\n\nContributing: Zach Wichter, USA TODAY; Reuters",

REUTERS/Mike Blake\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom, who has become a star in the Democratic Party, warned on Sunday that there is a GOP leader who could decide the fate of President Donald Trump's attempts to serve a third term in 2028 during an interview with CNN.\n\nNewsom predicted that Trump's second term would \"de facto end\" if Democrats can retake control of the House of Representatives during the 2026 midterm election. That would give the party control over the federal budget and give them the ability to impeach Trump for acts he takes while in office.\n\nHowever, there may be a dark-horse waiting in the wings to undercut Democrats' chances of retaking the White House in 2028, Newsom warned.\n\n\"Finally, you have rebalanced the system, coequal branch of government begins to assert itself, it appears again,\" Newsom told CNN. \"If you have a Speaker [Mike] Johnson (R-LA), we may have a third term of President Trump, I really believe that.\"\n\nTrump has consistently talked about running for a third term, something that is expressly prohibited by the 22nd Amendment to the Constitution. While some Republicans have rebuffed the chatter, Johnson has not weighed in on Trump's plans.\n\nTrump ally Steve Bannon has said there is a plan to install Trump as president in 2028.",

        "description": "California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a leading Democratic critic of President Donald Trump, says he'll consider running for the White House in 2028 after the midterm elections next year\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom, a leading Democratic critic of President Donald Trump, says he will consider running for the White House in 2028 after the midterm elections next year.\n\nAsked in an interview with \"CBS Sunday Morning\" whether if would be fair to say he would give a campaign serious thought after the November 2026 vote, the term-limited governor said, \"I'd be lying otherwise.\"\n\nNewsom has been trying to raise his national profile, adopting a combative style that parodies Trump's social media strategy with similar all-caps posts, memes and merchandise.\n\nThe Democratic governor has sparred with the Republican president over the deployment of the California National Guard following immigration protests and Trump's redistricting moves in Texas. Newsom has also led a campaign to redraw California's own maps to add five Democratic U.S. House seats in response to the changes in Texas. Voting is underway on the so-called Proposition 50 and concludes Nov. 4.\n\n\"I'm looking forward to who presents themselves in 2028 and who meets that moment. And that's the question for the American people,\" he said in the interview that aired Sunday.\n\nThe feud between Trump and Newsom does not seem like it's going away anytime soon. On Thursday, Trump acknowledged he had agreed to halt a planned show of federal force planned for this weekend in San Francisco after appeals from tech executives and the mayor. Newsom was mayor of San Francisco between 2004 and 2011.\n\nIn the interview, Newsom described Trump as an \"invasive species.\"\n\n\"He's a wrecking ball. Not just the symbolism and substance of the East Wing,\" Newsom said, referring to the demolition of that part of the White House to build a ballroom. \"He's wrecking alliances, truth, trust, tradition, institutions.\"\n\nEarlier this year, Newsom launched a podcast in an effort to brand himself as a centrist. During the show, he has held conversations with influential figures all across the political spectrum, from late conservative Charlie Kirk, who was assassinated on a college campus tour, as well as former Trump strategist Steve Bannon, to Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, who was former Vice President Kamala Harris' 2024 running mate, and U.S. Rep. Jasmine Crockett, a Texas Democrat.",

        "description": "California Gov. Gavin Newsom's characterizations of his humble origins are raising eyebrows, given his family's ties to the late billionaire heir Gordon Getty.\n\nDuring a recent appearance on the \"All The Smoke\" podcast, Newsom (D) recounted how his mother, who divorced from his father when he was young, hustled when he was growing up.\n\n\"My mom was 19, pregnant and divorced a few years later, with two kids,\" he said on the podcast. \"Came from no money and just hustled. You know, worked hard, grinding every single day. Two and a half jobs, no bulls -- .\"\n\n\"We had roommates all the time because she couldn't afford the rent,\" he continued. \"...It was also about paying the bills, man. It was just like hustling and and so I was out there, kind of raising myself, turning on the TV, just getting obsessed. I was sitting there with the Wonder Bread...the macaroni and cheese.\"\n\nThroughout his career, Newsom has told similar hardscrabble stories implying that he grew up in poverty or in the lower echelons of the middle class, seeking to be more relatable to voters.\n\nOver the summer, for example, he claimed to have slept on the couch and that his sister slept in a hallway because his mother had to rent out the spare bedroom.\n\nBut skeptics have pointed out that Newsom's late father, William, a former associate justice on the California Court of Appeals, served as a hifalutin attorney for Getty's billion-dollar fortune.\n\nWilliam was so involved with the Gettys that he helped deliver the ransom payment in response to the kidnapping of John Paul Getty III.\n\nThe elder Newsom previously explained that he was limited in helping out Gavin's mother financially due to his costly run for the Senate in 1968.\n\n\"I made a foolish mistake of putting my own money in it and losing,\" he said, according to a 2003 San Francisco Chronicle article.\n\n\"I had a huge deficit when it was over. I lost my law practice in the process. Things were unraveling. It took me quite a while to pull myself out financially. Tessa was working a number of jobs. Gavin had jobs after school.\"\n\nHe later added, \"I was around people of wealth, but I never had any money, nor did Gavin.\"\n\nYet, after Gavin graduated from Santa Clara University, he started up a boutique winery, PlumpJack Group, with Getty's financial backing.\n\n\"Anyone with more than an inch of curiosity would know that Governor Newsom was raised by his mother after her divorce from his father when he was 3 years old,\" a Newsom spokesperson told The Post.\n\n\"He has talked about moving between two different worlds, but he was raised by a mother who worked three jobs at one point -- secretary, waitress, and paralegal.\"\n\nNotably, Newsom attended kindergarten and first grade at \u00c9cole Notre Dame des Victoires, a Catholic school.\n\nIn August, Newsom trolled Vice President JD Vance, showing off a stylish photo purportedly of him in high school wearing a fancy scarf juxtaposed with a throwback pic of the VP in high school wearing a bland t-shirt standing next to women posed in front of urinals.",

        "description": "U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy warned Sunday that he's about make good on a threat to revoke millions in federal funds for California because he says the state is illegally issuing commercial driver's licenses to noncitizens.\n\nIn an appearance on Fox News Channel's \"Sunday Morning Futures\" Duffy said California Gov. Gavin Newsom has refused to comply with U.S. Department of Transportation rules that require the state to stop issuing such licenses and review those already issued.\n\n\"So, one, I'm about to pull $160 million from California,\" Duffy said. \"And, as we pull more money, we also have the option of pulling California's ability to issue commercial driver's licenses.\"\n\nNewsom's press office did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment on the matter Sunday, but California has defended its practices previously. When Duffy threatened to revoke funds last month, a spokesperson for Newsom dismissed the attack and noted that CDL holders from California have a significantly lower rate of crashes than both the national average and the Texas average, which is the only state with more licensed commercial drivers.\n\nLast month, the Transportation Department tightened commercial driver's license requirements for noncitizens after three fatal crashes that officials said were caused by immigrant truck drivers. Only three specific classes of visa holders will be eligible for CDLs under the new rules and states must verify an applicant's immigration status in a federal database. The licenses will be valid for up to one year unless the applicant's visa expires sooner.\n\nDuffy said last month that California should never have issued 25% of 145 licenses investigators reviewed. He cited four California licenses that remained valid after the driver's work permit expired -- sometimes years after. The state had 30 days to come up with a plan to comply or lose funding.\n\nA nationwide commercial driver's license audit began after officials say a driver in the country illegally made a U-turn and caused a crash in Florida that killed three people. It found licenses that were issued improperly in California, Colorado, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Texas and Washington.\n\nDuffy said Sunday that California has unlawfully issued tens of thousands of these licenses to noncitizens.\n\n\"So you have 60,000 people on the roads who shouldn't have licenses,\" Duffy said. \"They're driving fuel tankers, they're driving school buses, and we have seen some of the crashes on American roadways that come from these people who shouldn't have these licenses.\"\n\nDuffy said earlier this month that he would withhold $40 million from California because it is the only state that is failing to enforce English language requirements for truckers. California defended its practices in a formal response to the Transportation Department, but federal officials were not satisfied.\n\nThe investigation launched after the Florida crash found what Duffy called significant failures in the way California is enforcing rules that took effect in June after one of President Donald Trump's executive orders. California had issued the driver a commercial license, but these English rules predate the crash.",

And I'm not -- I can't do that.\"\n\nNewsom has taken to needling Trump frequently on social media, mocking his all-caps, exclamation-mark heavy style, as well as taking more serious actions like suing him to stop his deployment of the National Guard to California cities or sending them to other states.\n\n\"I'm looking forward to who presents themselves in 2028 and who meets that moment. And that's the question for the American people,\" he said in the interview that aired Sunday.\n\nDemocrats have been trying to find a path out of the political wilderness after President Joe Biden waited until July 2024 to abandon his reelection campaign and anoint Harris as his successor. With little more than three months to build a campaign against Trump, she still won 226 Electoral College votes to Trump's 312. A candidate needs 270 Electoral College votes to take the White House.\n\nThe party, while complaining bitterly about Trump's immigration, tariff and military policies, has yet to enunciate a clear vision of how they would govern if they won back control of the White House and Congress. Democrats lost ground with the Black and Hispanic voters they long took for granted, although polls show Trump is now losing some of the support he won from those voting blocs in 2024.\n\nBesides Harris and Newsom, other potential candidates include Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear and Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro.\n\nVice President JD Vance is widely expected to seek the Republican nomination.

And that's the question for the American people.\"\n\nElsewhere in the interview, Newsom admitted he has grave concerns about the possibility Donald Trump could attempt to seek a 3rd term -- which is prohibited by the 22nd Amendment. Newsom also has ideas about what Democrats can do to thwart the president, who he described as \"an invasive species.\"\n\nNewsom first attacked the Trump administration's attempts at redistricting - and then explained what could be described as his own attempt to do something similar. Californian voters will weigh in on Proposition 50, which would redraw congressional district lines in favor of the Democrats.\n\n\"On one level, Proposition 50 is about congressional maps, but you're framing it as something bigger. I think it's about our democracy. It's about the future of this republic. I think it's about what the founding fathers lived and died for,\" he said.\n\nNewsom also said that this year's elections could help Democrats \"take back the House\" and thus thwart some of the Trump administration's plans.\n\n\"If you have a Speaker Johnson, we may have a third term of President Trump. I really believe that. We do not want one of Trump's leading antagonists at a time when the President is wielding executive power across the board and facing little pushback from Republicans in Congress,\" he explained. \"We do not want our streets militarized by our own armed forces, not in LA, not in California, not anywhere.\"\n\nWhen asked what it's like leading the state of California with Trump in D.C., Newsom bluntly answered, \"Yeah, I mean, it's a hell of a way to govern.\"\n\n\"We're just governing in just profound uncertainty.

Gavin Newsom's claim that his redistricting plan would be temporary \"total fantasy\" during a CNN interview.\n\nFormer California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger dismissed current Gov. Gavin Newsom's argument that the proposed redistricting in the state was temporary, calling the notion \"total fantasy.\"\n\n\"I think when he -- when they say this is temporary, there is no such thing. I mean, the longest programs are government programs that are temporary. Okay, just remember that if this is a tax program or if it is the redistricting program, anything that is temporary with government is permanent,\" he told CNN's Jake Tapper on \"State of the Union,\" responding to a clip of Newsom touting his Proposition 50 legislation that would reshape congressional seats.\n\nVoting opened last week to add as many as five Democrat-held seats in Congress, which could possibly offset President Donald Trump's moves in Texas and elsewhere to help Republicans in the 2026 election. Obama endorsed Prop 50 this week.\n\n\"In the year 2032 when the independent redistricting commission is supposed to come back, they're going to say, 'Wait a minute. There's still gerrymandering going on in Texas. There's still gerrymandering going on in Ohio. There's still gerrymandering going on in Florida. We have to continue with gerrymandering.' This is what's going to happen. They will find an excuse. So therefore I don't think it is temporary. So that's total fantasy,\" Schwarzenegger said.\n\nREDISTRICTING BATTLE: NEWSOM VOWS TO FIGHT 'FIRE WITH FIRE'\n\nNewsom issued a response to those who oppose Proposition 50 and said, \"Spare me the moral high ground.\"\n\nSchwarzenegger called the redistricting efforts cheating, and said Democrats needed to outperform Trump.\n\n\"What the Democrats should do is they should outperform Trump. To me, it's all about competition creates performance. And so what they do is with the redistricting commission is that they're going to go and try to draw the district lines in such a way that they get voted in, no matter if they work well or not for the American people. So the American people get cheated on this whole thing. That is really the problem here,\" he said.\n\nABBOTT, TEXAS REPUBLICANS MAKE NEW PUSH FOR TRUMP-BACKED REDISTRICTING AS FLEEING DEMOCRATS TO END WALKOUT\n\nThe former Republican California governor said that he understood Republicans and Democrats needed to \"fight\" about it, but argued that Americans were being cheated.\n\n\"I think that if you want to really fight for democracy, why would you go in, destroy the Constitution in California, tear it up and redo it, do the whole thing? So to me, it just doesn't make any sense at all,\" he added.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE\n\nSchwarzenegger has come out against the redistricting efforts in a post on social media, where he posted a photo of himself at the gym wearing a t-shirt that read \"terminate gerrymandering.\"\n\nThe former governor also told CNN that he and Newsom were friendly and spoke about the issue.

He has acted as a foil to Trump administration policies and political maneuvering, pushing back against the presence of federal troops in Los Angeles, leading the effort to redraw the state's congressional maps to counter similar Republican efforts in Texas and even mocking the president's social media style.\n\nHis remarks on Sunday were not the first indication Mr. Newsom could run in 2028. In July, he met with Democratic voters in South Carolina, a pivotal primary state, which some saw as an early attempt to lay the groundwork for a run.\n\nIn the CBS interview, Mr. Newsom said he enjoyed that trip to South Carolina. \"I'm in the right business,\" he said. \"I love people.\"\n\nBut Mr. Newsom, who was one of President Joseph R. Biden's strongest allies on the 2024 campaign trail, made it clear that nothing was set in stone.\n\n\"I'm looking forward to who presents themselves in 2028 and who meets that moment,\" he said. \"That's the question for the American people.\"\n\nThe Democratic field for the next presidential race is still a long way from taking shape, but ambitious politicians with eyes on 2028 are beginning to make the kinds of trips that feel out, or potentially set up, official announcements.\n\nAnd at least two other party figures have acknowledged that they could be running in 2028.\n\nRahm Emanuel, the former Chicago mayor who served as the Biden administration's ambassador to Japan, is weighing a run.\n\nAnd former Vice President Kamala Harris suggested in an interview aired on Saturday that she was considering running again after falling short in 2024.\n\n\"I am not done,\" she told the BBC.",

        "description": "California Gov. Gavin Newsom revealed in a CBS interview on Sunday that he would give a presidential run \"serious thought\" after the 2026 midterm elections.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom, D-Calif., revealed on Sunday that he would start giving a possible 2028 run \"serious thought\" after the 2026 midterms during an interview with CBS.\n\n\"Is it fair to say, after the 2026 midterms, you're going to give it serious thought?\" CBS correspondent Robert Costa asked Newsom.\n\nThe California governor responded, \"Yeah, I'd be lying otherwise.\"\n\n\"I'd just be lying. And I can't do that,\" he added.\n\nNEWSOM WARNS AMERICANS 'YOU WILL LOSE YOUR COUNTRY' UNDER TRUMP AT CALIFORNIA SUMMIT\n\nCosta followed up and noted the governor has always said he would need a compelling reason to run for president.\n\n\"Are you moving closer to figuring out your own why and your own decision?\" Costa asked.\n\nNewsom responded by quoting Friedrich Nietzsche, \"if you have a compelling why, you can endure any how.\"\n\n\"I think the biggest challenge for anyone who runs for any office is people see right through you if you don't have that why. You're doing it for the wrong reasons. And so, look, faith will determine that,\" Newsom added.\n\nNEWSOM THREATENS TO SUE IF TRUMP SENDS TROOPS TO SAN FRANCISCO: 'WANNABE TYRANT'\n\nThe liberal governor also spoke about his redistricting efforts in California and about what he said was a masculinity crisis in the country, and how he's using his podcast to highlight it.\n\n\"We also have a crisis with masculinity and men. Men are struggling. And multi-ethic, I mean, suicide rates are off the chart, dropout rates, suspension rates, loneliness, despair, deaths of despair. It's a serious crisis what's going on in this country. Democrats haven't focused on that issue. And I'm very proud of the work, substantive work we're doing in this, but I've also been using the podcast to highlight that,\" he said.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE\n\nThe California governor argued during an interview in September that he fears there won't be an election in 2028.\n\n\"I fear that we will not have an election in 2028,\" he told late-night host Stephen Colbert. \"I really mean that in the core of my soul. Unless we wake up to the code red, what's happening in this country -- we wake up soberly to how serious this moment is.\"",

        "title": "Highlights from Gavin Newsom's \"Sunday Morning\" interview: Proposition 50, opposing Trump, and 2028",
        "description": "In an exclusive interview with Robert Costa for \"CBS Sunday Morning,\" California Governor Gavin Newsom described the Democrats' redistricting in his state as an effort to ensure \"the future of this republic\" - and a necessary measure to counter President Trump's push to expand Republican gains in the U.S. House and secure its narrow majority.\n\nThe vote on Proposition 50 this November 4 was just one of the issues the Democrat discussed, including his own plans for the 2028 election.\n\nNewsom has been stumping across his state advocating for redistricting, in response to President Trump's redistricting push in Republican-controlled states, like Texas.\n\nRather than gerrymander districts in the state legislature, as Texas did, California is putting a ballot initiative, Proposition 50, before the voters on November 4 in order to allow for redistricting in next year's midterm election.\n\nIf Proposition 50 succeeds next week, Democrats will change the boundaries of U.S. House districts in California, making it easier for their party to win up to five more seats. (The state currently has 43 U.S. House seats held by Democrats, and 9 by Republicans.)\n\nNewsom is framing the effort as something about more than California's Congressional delegation, but about oversight of the Trump administration. \"I think it's about our democracy,\" he said. \"It's about the future of this republic. I think it's about, you know, what the founding fathers lived and died for, this notion of the rule of law, and not the rule of Don. This rule of popular sovereignty fundamentally, of co-equal branches of government, system of checks and balances.\n\nNewsom believes that if his party takes back control of the House and replaces Republican Speaker Mike Johnson with a Democrat, the Trump presidency will effectively be over. \"[Trump's] presidency de facto ends, if we are successful, we the people are successful, in taking back the House,\" he said. \"You'll have rebalanced the system. Co-equal branch of government begins to assert itself. It appears again.\"\n\nBut he fears what may happen if Democrats do not gain control in the House: \"If you have a Speaker Johnson, we may have a third-term of President Trump, I really believe that,\" a nod to Mr. Trump's public musing about seeking a third term despite the U.S. Constitution limiting presidents to two terms in office.\n\nNewsom has fought Mr. Trump's deployment of federal agents in California - from Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers in Los Angeles, to the threat of federalized National Guard troops in San Francisco and the Bay Area (which the president later pulled back). In fact, the state has filed 43 lawsuits against the Trump administration since Inauguration Day.\n\nCosta asked, \"What's it's like being the governor of the state of California, and not knowing, day-to-day, if the federal government's going to be sending agents or not to your state?\"\n\n\"It's a hell of a way to govern,\" Newsom replied. \"I mean, we're just governing just profound uncertainty, the sort of tectonic plates that we're familiar with out here on the West Coast, but on the nature of our politics. I've said this - may not be a sort of prudent thing to say about a President of the United States - but I mean, he's an invasive species.\"\n\n\"For California?\"\n\n\"For the country. For the world,\" Newsom said. \"He's a wrecking ball. Not just the symbolism and substance of the East Wing; he's wrecking alliances, truth, trust, tradition, institutions.\"\n\nHe also rejected suggestions that ICE agents are needed in California because of what the White House called \"third-world insurrection riots on American soil.\"\n\n\"California cooperates as it relates to criminals,\" he said. \"We continue to cooperate out of our state penitentiary system hundreds of people every month that we coordinate with ICE to go after the 'worst of the worst.' That's not what this is about, and everybody knows it. You don't just randomly show up at a car wash and tell me it's about the 'worst of the worst.' You don't randomly show up at the showrooms or the parking lots of every Home Depot.\"\n\nNewsom isn't just opposing Mr. Trump; he's also trying to understand the MAGA movement. His podcast, \"This Is Gavin Newsom,\" not only welcomes figures on his side of the political aisle, but also the president's allies, from Steve Bannon and Newt Gingrich to the late Charlie Kirk.\n\nNewsom said his own son has reminded him about paying attention to other voices. \"We've got a crisis in this country besides the crisis that we've discussed around the future of this republic,\" he said. \"We also have a crisis with masculinity and men. Men are struggling. ... I mean, suicide rates are off the chart, dropout rates, suspension rates, loneliness, despair, depths of despair. It's a serious crisis, what's going on in this country.\n\n\"Democrats haven't focused on that issue. And I'm very proud of the work, substantive work we're doing in this, but I've also been using the podcast to highlight that.\"\n\nThe governor also uses satire to tweak the president, aping Mr. Trump's prolific use of social media. Newsom's communications team regularly parodies President Trump's use of all-caps and AI-generated images, even signing off, \"THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS MATTER. -- GCN\"\n\nNewsom has said that his social-media posts are driven by both his desire to add a sense of humor to politics, and to challenge President Trump by using Trump-style tactics.\n\nThis past July, \"Sunday Morning\" spent a day following Newsom across South Carolina, a key state in the 2028 presidential race. Newsom worked the crowds, shaking hands and even pulling espresso shots at a coffee bar.\n\nNewsom's visit sparked interest among those at his events and in political circles that he might be mulling his own White House bid.\n\n\"I'm looking forward to who presents themselves in 2028 and who meets that moment. And that's the question for the American people. They'll make that determination,\" Newsom said in the interview this past week.\n\nCosta asked, \"Is it fair to say after the 2026 midterms, you're going to give it serious thought?\"\n\n\"Yeah. I'd be lying otherwise. I'd just be lying. And I'm - I can't do that.\"\n\nHe said it would be important for a candidate to impart to voters exactly why they are running. \"Nietzsche said, 'If you have a compelling why, you can endure any how.' And so, I think the biggest challenge for anyone who runs for any office is people see right through you if you don't have that why. You're doing it for the wrong reasons.\"\n\n\"When I saw you slinging shots behind the coffee bar, I thought, 'This guy might run for president.'\" Costa said.\n\nNewsom, who as a child was diagnosed with dyslexia, said, \"The idea that a guy who got 960 on his SAT, that still struggles to read scripts, that was always in the back of the classroom - the idea that you even throw that out is, in and of itself, extraordinary,\" he laughed. \"Who the hell knows?\"",

        "description": "U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) listens to U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy speak during a press conference, weeks into the continuing U.S. government shutdown on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., U.S., October 23, 2025. REUTERS/Kylie Cooper\n\nTransportation Secretary Sean Duffy made good on a previous threat against California Sunday after confirming that his agency was \"about to pull $160 million\" in funding for the state in response to a deadly crash caused by a migrant truck driver, while also repeating another threat that could strip the state of its ability to issue commercial driver's licenses entirely.\n\n\"I'm about to pull $160 million from California, and as we pull more money, we also have the option of pulling California's ability to issue commercial driver's licenses,\" Duffy said, appearing on Fox News Sunday. \"Gavin Newsom cares more about illegals getting commercial driver's licenses than he does his citizens of his own state and the safety of Americans.\"\n\nJashanpreet Singh, a 21-year-old semitruck driver and undocumented immigrant, was arrested this week after being alleged to have caused the deadly crash that killed three and injured four in southern California. The incident sparked condemnation from the Trump administration amid its ongoing mass deportation efforts, especially from Duffy, who had already announced his agency would withhold $40 million from California earlier this month.\n\nDuffy previously threatened to withhold an additional $160 million, but confirmed that he would follow through on the threat on Sunday, while also floating the idea of stripping California of its ability to issue any commercial driver's licenses. He also railed into Newsom over the deadly crash, calling his conduct as California's governor \"shameful.\"\n\n\"It's shameful, he's been lying about what he's been doing, and again, we're going to fight tooth and nail under President Trump's administration to make sure that we hold states like California accountable,\" Duffy said.A",

        "title": "Ex-Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger criticizes nationwide surge in gerrymandering: 'It saddens me'",
        "description": "Former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger expressed deep concern over the growing trend of partisan redistricting across the United States, calling it a troubling shift from democratic principles.\n\nDuring an appearance on CNN's \"State of the Union,\" Mr. Schwarzenegger lamented that political parties are now focused on trying to cheat their way to victory rather than winning the battle of ideas.\n\n\"There's this war going on all over the United States. Who can out-cheat the other one?\" Mr. Schwarzenegger, a Republican, said Sunday from Gold's Gym in Venice, California. \"You know, Texas started it. They did something terribly wrong, and then all of a sudden, California says, 'Well, then we have to do something terribly wrong.'\"\n\n\"Now other states are jumping in, and now this is spreading like wildfire all over the country, and it saddens me to see that we're going in the opposite direction, rather than having an independent commission draw the district lines,\" he said.\n\nMr. Schwarzenegger, an actor who championed the creation of California's independent redistricting commission in 2008, has spoken out against recent efforts to redraw congressional maps for partisan advantage -- including those unfolding in his own state.\n\nThe redistricting battle began after President Trump pressed the Republican-led Texas Legislature to redraw its maps to add as many as five Republican seats, viewing it as key to defending the slim Republican majority in the midterm elections next year.\n\nIn response, California Democrats, led by Gov. Gavin Newsom, have proposed Proposition 50 -- also known as the Election Rigging Response Act.\n\nThe ballot measure, set for a vote this fall, would temporarily unwind part of the Schwarzenegger legacy by authorizing changes to the state's congressional maps in hopes of gaining five seats for Democrats.\n\n\"This is a revolution that's going on in real time in our country,\" Mr. Newson recently said. \"We need to wake up. Prop 50 is foundational if we're going to save this republic.\"\n\n\"So I would say to those that are opposed to it, wake up to these spare me the moral high ground,\" he said.\n\nPublic polls suggest the proposal is poised to pass.\n\nRepublicans in North Carolina and Missouri have also adopted new maps.\n\nVirginia could be next. Democrats have called a special session this week where they are expected to jumpstart the legislative process on a referendum question that would go to voters next year.\n\nMr. Schwarzenegger said he is skeptical of claims that California's proposed changes would be temporary.\n\nAlthough the referendum states the new maps would expire after the 2030 elections, he warned that such promises rarely hold.\n\n\"They're going to say, wait a minute, there's still gerrymandering going on in Texas. There's still gerrymandering going on in Ohio. There's still gerrymandering going on in Florida. We have to continue with the gerrymandering,\" he said. \"This is what's going to happen. They will find an excuse. So, therefore, I don't think it is temporary.\"",

        "title": "Gavin Newsom for president? California governor says he's considering running",
        "description": "Governor Gavin Newsom said President Donald Trump sending federal troops to San Francisco is part of the \"authoritarian playbook.\"\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom said he will consider making a run for the White House after next year's midterm elections, following months of speculation the Democratic figure is preparing for a 2028 presidential bid.\n\nIn a taped interview with \"CBS News Sunday Morning\" that aired on Oct. 26, Newsom said he is giving \"serious thought\" to running for president.\n\n\"I'd be lying otherwise,\" Newsom said, when asked if he was considering it. \"I'd just be lying. And I'm not - I can't do that.\"\n\nIt's not the first time Newsom has signaled his interest in the nation's top political office - and he's been at the top of Democratic rosters for several years. Before former President Joe Biden ended his 2024 campaign and endorsed then-Vice President Kamala Harris, Newsom's name was often floated as a possible Democratic candidate if Biden decided not to seek another term.\n\nDespite the speculation, the governor was one of the Biden-Harris campaign's most vocal campaign surrogates, staunchly supporting Biden as the nominee and later, Harris. Newsom has drawn increased attention over the years for his willingness to go toe-to-toe with Republican politicians in debates and on social media.\n\nSince President Donald Trump began his second term in January, Newsom has stepped up his adversarial position against the Republican administration, once again fashioning himself as a leader of the Democratic resistance to the Trump administration.\n\nIt's a role he also played during the president's first term, and he has made waves in recent months for publicly sparring with the president and Vice President JD Vance in viral social media posts and videos.\n\nThe governor has also launched various legal challenges, including over the deployment of thousands of National Guard troops to Los Angeles in June. Newsom is backing a statewide ballot measure known as Prop. 50, a counter to Texas' redistricting efforts that would redraw the state's congressional districts through 2030 and create five more seats favorable to Democrats.\n\nLatest polls show the measure has significant support in the deep-blue Golden State.\n\nNewsom, 58, is a former mayor of San Francisco is currently in his second term as California's governor. He will term-out at the end of 2027.\n\nHe did not say in his interview with CBS, taped in San Jose, when exactly he expects to make his decision after the midterm elections.\n\n\"I'm looking forward to who presents themselves in 2028, and who meets that moment,\" Newsom said. \"And that's the question for the American people.\"\n\nNewsom's aired interview comes a day after Harris told the BBC she still isn't ruling out another presidential run, after choosing not to run to succeed Newsom as the next governor of California.\n\nKathryn Palmer is a politics reporter for USA TODAY.

        "description": "Robert Costa is a national correspondent for \"CBS News Sunday Morning\" and chief Washington analyst for CBS News.\n\nDemocratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who has become one of President Trump's most high-profile adversaries, told \"CBS News Sunday Morning\" in an exclusive interview that he will consider whether to run for president after the 2026 midterm elections.\n\nIn an interview taped Thursday in San Jose, Newsom was asked whether he would give \"serious thought\" to a White House bid once next year's midterm elections are over.\n\n\"Yeah, I'd be lying otherwise,\" Newsom replied. \"I'd just be lying. And I'm not -- I can't do that.\"\n\nNewsom, whose term ends in January 2027 and is prevented from running again due to term limits, cautioned that any decision is years away.\n\n\"Fate will determine that,\" he said, when asked about whether he is moving closer to working out a reason for a national candidacy.\n\nNewsom, 58, has made trips to key battleground states, including a visit this past July to South Carolina, which as of now is slated to host the first Democratic primary in the 2028 presidential election, although that could change.\n\nDuring that trip, which featured multiple stops and was covered by \"CBS News Sunday Morning,\" Newsom met with state Democratic leaders and stopped by a coffee shop to rally activists and help employees serve espresso drinks.\n\n\"I happen to, and thank God, I'm in the right business,\" Newsom said in the interview, when asked about his evident enjoyment in meeting Democrats in South Carolina. \"I love people. I actually love people.\"\n\nNewsom said talk of him possibly running for president, after facing challenges throughout his life, including dyslexia, is a reminder to him that lives can go in surprising directions.\n\n\"I have no idea,\" Newsom said of whether he will decide to run. \"The idea that a guy who got 960 on his SAT, that still struggles to read scripts, that was always in the back of the classroom, the idea that you would even throw that out is, in and of itself, extraordinary. Who the hell knows? I'm looking forward to who presents themselves in 2028 and who meets that moment. And that's the question for the American people.\"\n\nNewsom said his focus now is on passing Proposition 50, a California ballot measure he has championed that would allow state Democrats to temporarily change the boundaries of U.S. House districts and make them more favorable to the party. Newsom has cast his effort, which will be decided in a special election next week, as a response to Mr. Trump's push for Republican-controlled states, like Texas, to change their congressional maps so the GOP has a better chance at holding on to its narrow House majority next year.\n\n\"I think it's about our democracy. It's about the future of this republic. I think it's about, you know, what the Founding Fathers lived and died for, this notion of the rule of law, and not the rule of Don,\" Newsom said.\n\nTensions have run high ahead of the vote, with both parties seeing redistricting efforts as critical to achieving their goal of winning the U.S. House majority next year. Whichever party holds control of the House has subpoena and oversight powers over the Executive Branch.\n\n\"We've got hundreds and hundreds, ICE and Border Patrol,\" Newsom told Proposition 50 supporters on Thursday at a labor event, referring to federal agents in the state. Newsom predicted their presence might increase ahead of the Nov. 4 special election.\n\n\"Don't think for a second we're not going to be seeing more of that through Election Day,\" Newsom said. \"These guys are not screwing around.\"\n\nIn recent days, the Justice Department said it would send its own monitors to supervise the special election in California and the gubernatorial election in New Jersey. Newsom has denounced the move, calling it a Trump administration move to intimidate Democrats. The goal, according to the Justice Department, is \"to ensure transparency, ballot security, and compliance with federal law.\"\n\nWhile Newsom has long been a fixture in California, his foray into presidential politics generated intense interest last year when he was a fierce defender of President Joe Biden, especially in the wake of Biden's debate performance against Mr. Trump, which prompted many Democrats to call for Biden to exit the 2024 race.\n\nNewsom, however, never wavered on Biden's candidacy. In the days before Biden dropped out of the race, Newsom stumped for him nationwide, including in New Hampshire.\n\nSpeaking with \"CBS News Sunday Morning\" there in July 2024, about a week before Biden left the race, Newsom said he was \"all in\" on Biden.\n\n\"No daylight,\" Newsom said of his alliance with Biden at the time.\n\nAccording to sources close to both Newsom and Biden, the two men are close and have stayed in touch since Biden left the White House. Newsom is also friendly with former President Barack Obama, who has offered support for Proposition 50 and joined Newsom and volunteers on a video call last week.",

        "title": "We listened to all the podcasts from 2028 candidates. Here's who stood out.",
        "description": "California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) during a \"fireside chat\" in February in Los Angeles. (Ted Soqui/Sipa USA/AP)\n\nWhen California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) launched a podcast seven months ago, he was tapping into a broader trend. Politicians, who once saw podcasts as fringe or risky, now see them as an opportunity to connect with voters in a more casual setting and relish the chance to talk for hours at a time without a filter.\n\nNot all of the politician-hosted pods are must-listens -- unless you love awkward dad jokes, groveling interviews with donors and fellow elected officials, and a heavy dose of self-promotion. Many don't last long. Former presidential candidates Pete Buttigieg, Nikki Haley, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Vivek Ramaswamy are among those who abandoned their podcasts, as are countless members of Congress.\n\nIs anyone listening? It depends. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) draws the largest audience, with an average 1.8 million downloads and views per month. Others have far fewer listeners: A podcast co-hosted by Rep. Gil Cisneros (D-California) averages only 23, according to totals pulled by the podcast analytics firm Podscribe as of earlier this month.\n\nThat hasn't stopped people from trying. No fewer than six potential presidential candidates now host their own shows, with the majority launching just this year.\n\nAndy Beshear: The supportive dad with business guy friends\n\nKentucky Gov. Andy Beshear (D) frames his feel-good podcast -- launched in April -- as a way for listeners to process the onslaught of news. The show features friendly interviews with Democratic governors, members of Congress, influencers, celebrities, athletes and musicians, and one big donor -- often ending with rapid-fire softball questions like guests' favorite sports, foods, teams, playlist picks, fashion mistakes or secret super powers.\n\nThe SiriusXM podcast has a focus on listener self-care and comes with a list of rules -- to be authentic (\"You be you, boo\"), talk like a real human being, no debating reality, tell your why and have fun. For Beshear and his fellow middle-aged friends, that equates to a recurring segment where they learn such Gen Z slang as \"skibidi\" or \"clock it\" from Beshear's children or the show's intern. The results are as corny as you'd imagine.\n\n* Key quote: \"Make sure if you're overwhelmed you take a minute to breathe, reach out to your friends, process with them just like you do on this podcast. You're important, we care about you.\"\n\n* The Jo(h)ns: Beshear's first guest on the show was Democratic megadonor John Morgan, the billionaire founder of Morgan & Morgan, who announced this year that he is starting a new political party. He's not the only Morgan & Morgan affiliate to make an appearance: The podcast includes a regular segment where Beshear and two friends -- Morgan & Morgan attorney Jon Rabinowitz and insurance company owner John McConnell -- discuss the news of day.\n\n* The sponsors: Ads on the podcast include those for a website that shares information on ingredients in drinks, Andy Cohen's podcast, JPMorgan Chase, the Marines and Comcast.\n\nTed Cruz: The traditional conservative talk show\n\n\"Verdict with Ted Cruz\" launched during President Donald Trump's first impeachment trial in 2020, and the show -- co-hosted by Ben Ferguson -- has become the most downloaded and viewed of those hosted by potential 2028 candidates. The iHeartRadio podcast expanded this spring with a new weekend radio show, making Cruz the only sitting senator with a talk radio show and a mainstay in the GOP podcast space.\n\nThe podcast is unapologetically partisan, offering insight into conservative thinking about the latest news out of Washington and sharp criticism and mocking of Democratic elected officials. Cruz also offers a behind-the-scenes look at the daily work of a senator, recapping trips to El Salvador and his latest back-and-forth with reporters in the halls of the Capitol in between the typical news of the day breakdown.\n\n* The sponsors: Ads include those for gold and silver dealers, \"less lethal\" defense pistols, dog supplements and Patriot Mobile.\n\n* Newsmaker: Cruz sometimes makes news on the show, like he did when he said Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr's threat to revoke ABC's license over a monologue by late-night host Jimmy Kimmel was \"dangerous as hell.\"\n\n* Most viewed: The most viewed YouTube versions of the vlogcast is a two-part interview with Elon Musk taped at the White House, where they discussed life on Mars and killer robots. (Cruz: \"How real is the prospect of killer robots annihilating humanity?\" Musk: \"Twenty percent likely, maybe 10 percent.\")\n\nRon DeSantis: The Florida man\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R), whose presidential ambitions were complicated in part by his awkwardness, is the latest GOP podcaster to hit the scene. Like in his campaign and governorship, DeSantis is wonkish and cerebral in the show hosted on his official gubernatorial YouTube page, discussing issues like \"Bidenflation\" and property taxes.\n\nThe show is like a pro-Florida news conference, featuring friendly interviews with political allies about the policies that have defined DeSantis's political brand. At times the show feels like a throwback to the early days of his presidential campaign: His first episode, released in May, is a conversation with Florida Surgeon General Joseph A. Ladapo, with the governor immediately mentioning Anthony S. Fauci, vaccine passports, covid jabs and mask hysteria.\n\n* Guest list: Florida, Florida, Florida -- state chief financial officer Blaise Ingoglia, Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd and the new lieutenant governor, Jay Collins.\n\n* Sports zone: DeSantis (a former college baseball player) likes to talk Marlins, Gators, Seminoles and Hurricanes, and he has hosted retired pitcher Tom Glavine.\n\n* Cold open: \"Hello. Do you ever really own your own home? In America, local jurisdictions impose property taxes on individuals land and private residences, which raises the question, if you buy a house and you live on it, you consider that your own private property. And yet you have to continue writing a check to the government every year just for the privilege of being able to use property that you supposedly already own. And that's different than how we normally do things in America.\"\n\nGavin Newsom: The people pleaser\n\n\"This Is Gavin Newsom\" is the most listened to and downloaded podcast by a Democratic elected official, by far. The podcast is centered on \"debating without demeaning\" and has proved controversial since its launch on iHeartRadio in March, with some Democrats upset that Newsom has held friendly chats with MAGA Republicans like Charlie Kirk, Stephen K. Bannon, Sean Spicer and Newt Gingrich.\n\nMost episodes focus on biographical interviews featuring politicians, influencers and Hollywood celebrities like writer and director Ryan Murphy. Newsom frequently asks guests about how Democrats lost, and he is particularly interested in why young men left the party. He has devoted multiple episodes to conversations with gender scholars and researchers who study men.\n\n* 2028 watch: Newsom and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz (D) debated Newsom's decision to have conversations on the podcast with the Republican personalities whom Walz called \"bad guys.\" Newsom argued that it's foolhardy to \"deny they exist\" and that \"we have to first understand what their motivations are.\" Walz joked about putting them \"back under a rock\" and questioned what their motivations are beyond racism and misogyny.\n\n* The sponsors: Ads include Toyota, Simply Safe, Saks Off Fifth and podcasts like \"On Purpose\" with Jay Shetty.\n\n* Not his first rodeo: Before launching the show, Newsom co-hosted an iHeart podcast earlier this year called \"Politickin'\" with football player Marshawn Lynch and agent Doug Hendrickson.\n\nStephen A. Smith: The confrontational centrist\n\nLongtime sports commentator Stephen A. Smith, who has spurred presidential buzz, launched his political show \"Straight Shooter with Stephen A.\" in September on SiriusXM's POTUS channel. Despite downplaying his political ambitions, he fielded questions in his first episode about what he would do first as president and framed hosting a politics show as his \"destiny.\"\n\nSmith opened with a lengthy explanation of his personal politics, positioning himself as an independent voice and promising: \"I hit everyone. I don't pull punches for liberals or conservatives.\" If Smith chooses to launch a celebrity bid for the White House -- particularly if he runs as a Democrat -- his show provides plenty of fodder for future opponents. He delivers frustrated rants against party leaders and praise for Republicans. He is critical of Trump, but at his most passionate when expressing his exasperation at Democrats -- sparing his two favorites for 2028, Govs. Josh Shapiro (D-Pennsylvania) and Wes Moore (D-Maryland).\n\n* The goal: \"I'm trying to help. That's all I'm trying to do. I'm trying to prevent the Democratic Party from drifting into oblivion, never to return.\"\n\n* Guest list: The first episode featured Shapiro, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina) and Utah Gov. Spencer Cox (R), with friendly surprise calls from pals Sean Hannity and Chris Cuomo.\n\n* Ears are burning: Smith has said House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries needs to do a better job at resonating with the American people, questioned the tactics of Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-New York) and Jasmine Crockett's (D-Texas) name calling, expressed skepticism about Newsom's presidential prospects, and predicted the end of Vice President Kamala Harris's political career.\n\nDonald Trump Jr.: The MAGA warrior\n\nOn Donald Trump Jr.'s \"Triggered with Don Jr.\" -- launched in 2023 -- the president's son directly takes the MAGA message to the base with his typical combative but conversational approach. The guest list regularly features the biggest Trumpworld celebrities of the moment, including members of Congress, Cabinet members, foreign leaders and GOP influencers. The hyper-partisan show focuses on culture war issues and is framed as a direct communication method that can bypass the mainstream media. It frequently revisits major Trump moments like the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol and the Russia investigation.\n\nTrump uses the show to defend his father's agenda and sometimes offers behind-the-scenes stories about being a member of the first family, as he did when he recalled a recent trip to Scotland where he and his children watched Trump negotiate a trade deal and open a golf course, which he deemed \"epic.\" Some episodes sound more like infomercials than a typical podcast, like a recent one featuring Eric Trump promoting American Bitcoin, a cryptocurrency company partially owned by the two brothers.\n\n* The sponsors: A nonlethal self-defense weapon company, gold, an automated ammunition stockpiling service, a Rumble-affiliated coffee company branded as \"fuel for the Anti-Woke Folk.\"\n\n* Key quote: \"We are the last line of defense against a completely destructive leftist agenda at home and abroad.\"",

        "description": "An Exxon gas station is seen on August 05, 2024 in Austin, Texas. Brandon Bell | Getty Images\n\nExxon Mobil is suing the state of California over a pair of 2023 climate disclosure laws that the company says infringe upon its free speech rights, namely by forcing it to embrace the message that large companies are uniquely to blame for climate change.\n\nThe oil and gas corporation based in Texas filed its complaint Friday in the U.S. Eastern District Court for California. It asks the court to prevent the laws from going into effect next year.\n\nIn its complaint, ExxonMobil says it has for years publicly disclosed its greenhouse gas emissions and climate-related business risks, but it fundamentally disagrees with the state's new reporting requirements.\n\nThe company would have to use \"frameworks that place disproportionate blame on large companies like ExxonMobil\" for the purpose of shaming such companies, the complaint states.\n\nUnder Senate Bill 253, large businesses will have to disclose a wide range of planet-warming emissions, including both direct and indirect emissions such as the costs of employee business travel and product transport.\n\nExxonMobil takes issue with the methodology required by the state, which would focus on a company's emissions worldwide and therefore fault businesses just for being large as opposed to being efficient, the complaint states.\n\nThe second law, Senate Bill 261, requires companies making more than $500 million annually to disclose the financial risks that climate change poses to their businesses and how they plan to address them.\n\nThe company said in its complaint that the law would require it to speculate \"about unknowable future developments\" and post such speculations on its website.\n\nA spokesperson for the office of California Gov. Gavin Newsom said in an email that it was \"truly shocking that one of the biggest polluters on the planet would be opposed to transparency.\"",

Fox & Friends co-hosts weigh in.\n\nCalifornia Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom's rebuke of the Justice Department's move to monitor the November election in his state is getting strong pushback, including from a DOJ official who noted the move is not out of the ordinary.\n\n\"Donald Trump's puppet DOJ has no business screwing around with next month's election,\" Newsom posted on Friday in response to news the DOJ plans to send federal election watchers to California and New Jersey for their closely watched elections next month.\n\n\"Sending the feds into California polling places is a deliberate attempt to scare off voters and undermine a fair election. We will not back down. Californians decide our future -- no one else.\"\n\nMany on social media, including DOJ Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights Harmeet Dhillon, quickly pointed out that the Justice Department has a long history of sending election monitoring resources to areas that have a history of issues in order to ensure election laws are being followed.\n\nNEWSOM THREATENS TO SUE IF TRUMP SENDS TROOPS TO SAN FRANCISCO: 'WANNABE TYRANT'\n\n\"Lol calm down bro,\" Dhillon posted on X. \"The @TheJusticeDept under Democrat administrations has sent in federal election observers for decades, and not once did we hear that this was voter intimidation from states such as California.

They are not law enforcement officers or federal agents.\n\nFor decades, the Justice Department's civil rights division has sent attorneys and staff members to monitor polling places across the country in both federal and non-federal elections. The monitors are tasked with ensuring compliance with federal voting rights laws.\n\nThe Justice Department's Civil Rights Division enforces a number of statutes protecting the right to vote. That includes the Voting Rights Act, which prohibits intimidation and threats against those who are casting ballots or counting votes. And it includes the Americans with Disabilities Act, which mandates that election officials ensure people with disabilities have the full and equal opportunity to vote.",

        "title": "Kamala Harris doesn't rule out another presidential run in new interview: 'I am not done'",
        "description": "Former Vice President Kamala Harris, who many suspect plans to run in 2028, spoke to Charlamagne tha God about her political future, vowing to continue the political fight.\n\nFormer Vice President Kamala Harris has hinted at another run for president -- possibly her strongest indication yet that she may throw her hat back in the ring for commander in chief.\n\nHarris, who was defeated by President Donald Trump in last year's election, told the BBC that she is keeping her options open and dismissed polls that view her as a 2028 outsider. She also branded the president as a \"tyrant.\"\n\n\"I am not done,\" she told the United Kingdom outlet. \"I have lived my entire career as a life of service, and it's in my bones.\"\n\nCNN PANEL SHREDS HARRIS' COLBERT INTERVIEW FOR HER LACK OF SOLUTIONS AFTER 'SIX MONTHS TO FIGURE IT OUT'\n\nHarris lost the electoral college to Trump 312 to 226 and went down by 2.3 million votes in the popular vote. She was catapulted into the race as the Democratic primary nominee following then-President Joe Biden's withdrawal from the election in the wake of a disastrous debate performance.\n\nSince the defeat, Harris kept a low enough profile until the publication last month of her book, \"107 Days,\" detailing her short, failed presidential campaign. In the book, she argues she had too little time to define her message or distance herself from Biden's record. She also cited Democrat infighting and a lack of donor confidence.\n\nIn her BBC interview, Harris left the door open to another White House run, saying her grandnieces would \"in their lifetime, for sure\" see a female president.\n\nWhen asked if that person could be her, she replied, \"possibly,\" signaling she's considering another bid.\n\nHarris said she hasn't made a decision but still sees herself as having a political future.\n\n\"I am not done,\" she said. \"I have lived my entire career as a life of service, and it's in my bones.\"\n\nThere is no clear frontrunner to lead the Democrats into the 2028 election and a potential crowded list of nominees includes California Gov. Gavin Newsom, former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, among others.\n\nHarris said she was undeterred by unfavorable polls.\n\n\"If I listened to polls I would have not run for my first office, or my second office -- and I certainly wouldn't be sitting here,\" she said.\n\nThe full interview will air on Sunday, but the BBC released excerpts on Saturday.\n\nHarris said that her concerns that Trump would act like an authoritarian have come true.\n\nKAMALA HARRIS DECISION NOT TO RUN IN 2026 OPENS DOOR TO POSSIBLE SECOND PRESIDENTIAL RUN IN 2028\n\n\"He said he would weaponize the Department of Justice -- and he has done exactly that,\" Harris told the BBC.\n\nShe pointed to the suspension of late-night comic Jimmy Kimmel by ABC after he made a joke about Republican reaction to the death of Charlie Kirk.\n\nKimmel's show was suspended by ABC, after Trump-appointed FCC Chair Brendan Carr threatened broadcasters, and the move was celebrated by Trump. Kimmel appeared to falsely suggest the alleged assassin was a MAGA supporter and was brought back on air the following week.\n\n\"You look at what has happened in terms of how he has weaponized, for example, federal agencies going around after political satirists... His skin is so thin he couldn't endure criticism from a joke and attempted to shut down an entire media organization in the process,\" Harris said.\n\nHarris labeled Trump a \"tyrant,\" accusing business leaders and institutions of cozying up to the president and bowing to his demands.\n\n\"There are many... that have capitulated since day one, who are bending the knee at the foot of a tyrant, I believe for many reasons, including they want to be next to power, because they want to perhaps have a merger approved or avoid an investigation,\" Harris said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe White House was dismissive when asked by the BBC for a response to Harris's comments.\n\n\"When Kamala Harris lost the election in a landslide, she should've taken the hint -- the American people don't care about her absurd lies,\" spokeswoman Abigail Jackson told the outlet. \"Or maybe she did take the hint and that's why she's continuing to air her grievances to foreign publications.\"\n\nFox News Digital has also asked the White House for comment.",

Contact her at cara.tabachnick@cbsinteractive.com\n\nKamala Harris mused about her political future and another presidential run, saying Saturday, \"I am not done,\" in a wide-ranging interview with CBS News' partner, the BBC.\n\nHarris initially stayed out of the spotlight after losing the 2024 race to Donald Trump, but she has been back on the airwaves in the past month to promote her new book, \"107 Days,\" about her turbulent time as the Democratic nominee.\n\nAsked in her BBC interview whether former President Joe Biden's last-minute withdrawal from the race stymied her chance to become president, Harris said it was a question to which she will never know the answer.\n\nShe said warnings she made about President Trump on the campaign trail had been proved right, calling him a \"tyrant.\" She said she believed her predictions about Mr. Trump running an authoritarian government had been realized. Harris also called out businesses and universities for, in her view, toeing the line and bowing too easily to the president's demands.\n\nThe White House responded to Harris' assertions in a statement to the BBC through spokeswoman Abigail Jackson.\n\n\"When Kamala Harris lost the election in a landslide, she should've taken the hint - the American people don't care about her absurd lies.\"\n\nDuring the interview, Harris also focused on the future and touched on the possibility of a woman being in the White House one day.\n\nHarris told the BBC her grandnieces would, \"in their lifetime, for sure,\" see a female president. She then mused on her political future, saying she still sees herself having one.\n\n\"I am not done,\" Harris said. \"I have lived my entire career as a life of service and it's in my bones.\"\n\nWhen asked whether she would consider another presidential run, Harris didn't commit, but didn't rule it out, saying \"possibly,\" and adding, \"I'm not focusing on that right now.\"\n\nHowever, when CBS News polled residents in her home state of California this week on whether Harris or Gov. Gavin Newsom should run for president in 2028, fewer than a third of voters endorsed her having another try.\n\nEven among registered Democrats in California, which Harris won in 2024, just under half think she should run again.\n\nMost independents don't think Newsom or Harris should run, but of the two, by comparison, they are more likely to back the California governor.",

        "description": "Ms. Harris, in an interview with the BBC, gave her strongest indication yet that she was thinking about making another bid for the Oval Office.\n\nFormer Vice President Kamala Harris said that her time in politics has not come to an end, offering her strongest indication to date that she would consider a third presidential run.\n\nIn an interview with the BBC, Ms. Harris said she remained confident a woman will become president one day and that it could \"possibly\" be her.\n\n\"I am not done,\" she said. \"I have lived my entire career as a life of service and it's in my bones.\"\n\nMs. Harris made the remarks on \"Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg\", a prime weekend political show in Britain, as part of a media blitz promoting the book she released last month that recounts her 107-day campaign for the White House.\n\nMs. Harris stressed that she has made no decisions about the 2028 campaign, which is widely expected to feature an expansive field of ambitious governors, members of Congress and political outsiders.\n\nShe dismissed early polls showing her trailing in the potentially crowded contest.\n\n\"If I listened to polls, I would have not run for my first office, or my second office -- and I certainly wouldn't be sitting here,\" she said.\n\nEven in the midst of her book tour, Ms. Harris has taken a relatively cautious approach to the Trump administration. Earlier this year, she announced that she would not run for governor of California, declining to make a bid for one of the country's most powerful perches to push back on the administration and set the future direction for the Democratic Party.\n\nWhile Democratic governors like JB Pritzker of Illinois, Gavin Newsom of California and Tim Walz of Minnesota, who ran with Ms. Harris on the 2024 Democratic ticket, have been vocal critics of the president, Ms. Harris has carefully picked her moments to speak out.\n\nIn the interview, she argued that her predictions during the 2024 campaign that Mr. Trump would run an authoritarian government had come true.\n\n\"He said he would weaponize the Department of Justice -- and he has done exactly that,\" she said.\n\nShe reiterated her criticism of corporations, universities, media companies and law firms that she said had capitulated to Mr. Trump's demands, citing ABC's decision to suspend the late night host Jimmy Kimmel over his remarks following the assassination of Charlie Kirk, a conservative activist.\n\nHer husband, Doug Emhoff, is a partner at Willkie Farr & Gallagher, which was one of the first law firms that cut a deal to avoid being sanctioned by the Trump administration. Mr. Emhoff has said he disagreed with the decision by his firm to pledge $100 million in pro bono legal work for causes the president has championed.",

        "title": "What Trump's federal crackdown looks like in 5 US cities",
        "description": "President Donald Trump said San Francisco may be next in his federal anti-crime crackdown despite local opposition.\n\nIn Chicago, federal agents rappelled from Black Hawk helicopters onto an apartment building. In Portland, Oregon, masked officers clashed with protesters wearing inflatable animal costumes. In the nation's capital, police set up checkpoints and troops patrolled the streets.\n\nSince early June, President Donald Trump has surged federal resources into a growing number of Democratic-led cities as part of widening crackdowns on illegal immigration and violent crime.\n\nThe deployments have sparked intense backlash, a dizzying number of legal battles and upended daily life in communities flooded with federal agents and National Guard troops.\n\nThe Trump administration says the added resources are needed to service the president's mass deportation campaign and clamp down on violence in liberal cities. Critics, including state and local officials, say the deployments are an illegal show of force and a power grab.\n\nAcross the country, federal operations have taken different forms, shaped by levels of cooperation between federal and local officials, protests over heightened immigration enforcement and the scale of the operations themselves.\n\nIn several cities, immigration raids touched off a wave of demonstrations, prompting Trump to call up National Guard troops. In others, federal agents worked closely with local police to target crime more broadly, setting up roving patrols and checkpoints. One major commonality: The cities all experienced a surge in immigration enforcement.\n\nReporters across the USA TODAY Network spoke with experts, residents, officials and local advocates to capture the impact of federal intervention in U.S. cities, including Los Angeles, Washington, DC, Memphis, Portland and Chicago - a short list that seems likely to grow as the president eyes deployments to other cities.\n\nMany residents and local officials said the cities didn't need intervention, especially a deployment of troops. Some living in crime-stricken areas said while they generally support the idea of more law enforcement in their communities, they want the operations to target violent crimes - not immigration violations.\n\nExperts, meanwhile, said targeted police work is the most effective way to lower crime and worry that the federal government's flood-the-zone tactics, both in immigration enforcement and general crimefighting, could erode public trust in police.\n\n\"Aggressive enforcement needs to be reserved for the most aggressive criminals,\" said Thomas Abt, director of the Center for the Study and Practice of Violence Reduction. He added that broad, heavy-handed policing has \"limited benefits and a lot of collateral consequences.\"\n\nWhite House spokesperson Abigail Jackson hailed the president's efforts and said local leaders across the country should take inspiration and \"clean up their city.\"\n\n\"Making America Safe Again - especially crime-ridden cities - was a key campaign promise from the President that the American people elected him to fulfill,\" Jackson said in a statement.\n\nChicago: Intensifying ICE raids and widespread protests\n\nThe nation's third-largest city has become the latest flashpoint in the battle between local officials and the Trump administration over the president's deportation campaign and federal deployments.\n\nIn September, Trump launched Operation Midway Blitz, an initiative he said was needed to catch \"the worst of the worst\" criminal immigrants. Research has shown that on average immigrants commit fewer crimes than native-born Americans. Further, immigration violations, such as living in the country without proper documentation, are civil, not criminal under U.S. law.\n\nExpanding ICE raids triggered protests in downtown Chicago and the city's surrounding suburbs. As tensions boiled, clashes broke out and federal agents used pepper balls and tear gas, hitting journalists, a pastor and officers with the Chicago Police Department, according to reports and a lawsuit.\n\nThe president called for the arrests of Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson for \"failing to protect\" ICE agents.\n\nResidents and local advocates have accused ICE of employing reckless and brutal tactics during the blitz. Some incidents that have raised alarm: Immigration agents fatally shot a Mexican immigrant accused of resisting arrest; a Border Patrol agent shot and wounded a U.S. citizen on the city's South Side; and reportedly, a school had to hold recess indoors after federal authorities deployed a chemical agent nearby.\n\nThe most controversial raid came on Sept. 30, when federal agents descended from Black Hawk helicopters and ransacked a South Side apartment building in an aggressive search of apartments inhabited by Venezuelan migrants.\n\nTwo of 37 people arrested were \"confirmed\" gang members, according to the Department of Homeland Security. Dozens of U.S. citizens were pulled from their beds and temporarily zip-tied during the operation, which Pritzker wants investigated by state agencies.\n\nHomeland Security officials say aggressive tactics are necessary to catch criminals, and accused protesters of attacking agents and \"rioting.\" Over 1,500 immigrants have been arrested in connection with the blitz, the agency said. USA TODAY has not been able to verify the number of detentions or criminal background of those in custody.\n\nChicagoans said the federal intervention have made their neighborhoods virtually unrecognizable.\n\n\"We went from being this community that walks our kids to school or goes out to parks. Now the streets are empty,\" said Corina Pedraza, a longtime South Sider.\n\nLocal alderwoman Julia Ramirez told USA TODAY that people \"can't live their lives the way they did before.\"\n\n\"Agents have created a war zone in our community,\" she said.\n\nPortland, Oregon: Tensions flare at ICE facility\n\n\"War ravaged,\" \"burning to the ground\" and \"hell\" are words Trump has used to describe the liberal stronghold of Portland in recent weeks - characterizations vehemently disputed by local residents and officials.\n\nThe back-and-forth comes as the president seeks to deploy troops to the city over the objections of local and state officials. An federal judge in Oregon initially blocked the deployments but an appeals court on Oct. 20 ruled in Trump's favor, lifting one of the orders preventing the president from calling up 200 Oregon guardsmen to Portland.\n\nTrump officials say soldiers are necessary to protect federal personnel and an ICE facility in South Portland where demonstrators have protested on a nightly basis.\n\nOutside the facility earlier this month, USA TODAY reporters saw demonstrators peacefully protesting. There were people in puffy animal costumes dancing on the sidewalk and waving signs as motorists drove by, honking in support. Other forms of resistance have had a distinctly Portland vibe, such as an \"emergency\" naked bike ride in mid-October.\n\nCity residents said Trump's characterization of Portland as a city \"under siege\" is false and misleading.\n\n\"It offends me so deeply that we have a president that is willing and able to spread such misinformation without hitting the streets and coming out here,\" said Tiana Stewart, 37, a bartender. \"But he knows that the people who are watching are going to buy into it. It's ludicrous to me.\"\n\nPortland is not without its problems. Homeless camps are visible in parts of the city and drug use, especially the surge of fentanyl, is a serious concern that prompted officials to declare a 90-day state of emergency last year. But residents said they don't think the president's crackdown is meant to address those issues.\n\n\"Obviously, this is all a scam,\" said Curtis Best, 70, a retired molecular biologist. \"I really believe it's a way to militarize police and make problems in these cities ... I think he just wants revenge on us. I think he just doesn't like Democrat cities, Democrat states or its people.\"\n\nMemphis: A crime-stricken city flooded with feds. Is it helping?\n\nUnlike other cities where Trump deployed National Guard troops, Memphis sits in a state led by a Republican governor who has welcomed the president's wishes to mobilize military forces.\n\nIn September, Trump created a crime-fighting task force involving over a dozen federal agencies and the state's National Guard - a move he said was requested by Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee.\n\nA week after troops were seen patrolling downtown Memphis on Oct. 10, a group of Democratic officials filed a lawsuit against Lee, claiming the deployment violated the state constitution. A judge has since denied the plaintiffs' request to pause the deployment.\n\nIn 2024, Memphis had the highest rate of murder and other violent crimes of any large American city, according to a USA TODAY analysis of FBI data from 30 cities with more than 500,000 residents.\n\nMemphis Mayor Paul Young, a Democrat, said he's working to steer the task force to focus on violent offenders, rather than immigration enforcement.\n\n\"The busier we can keep them with (the Memphis Police Department), the less time they will have to focus on immigration,\" he said at a town hall on Oct. 20.\n\nOfficials have given conflicting portrayals of the task force's work so far.\n\nThe White House says the task force has yielded 1,300 arrests related to outstanding warrants, drugs and firearms. But a county mayor and local advocates say a large portion of the arrests were for immigration offenses, not violent crime.\n\nMauricio Calvo, president and CEO of advocacy organization Latino Memphis, said some people have shut themselves in their homes because of the heightened immigration enforcement and concerns over racial profiling.\n\n\"People don't want to send the kids to school, people don't want to work,\" he said. \"We're in crisis mode.\"\n\nWashington, DC: Mixed feelings on Trump's crime crackdown\n\nTrump declared a \"crime emergency\" in the nation's capital on Aug. 11, using its status as a federal district to take control of the city's police department and send in thousands of federal agents and National Guard troops.\n\nFor weeks, federal agents and local police set up checkpoints across the city, spurring protests. Immigration raids expanded, instilling fear as officers arrested workers and delivery drivers. Several of the city's small homeless campsites were broken down, leading some of the homeless to enter shelters temporarily.\n\nMeanwhile, National Guard troops patrolled monuments and Metro stations, some with assault rifles. They removed graffiti, picked up trash and shoveled mulch. An internal budget viewed by USA TODAY estimated the guard deployment could cost taxpayers more than $200 million.\n\nAfter 30 days, the federal takeover of the police department ended and Trump declared the operation a success, touting a drop in reported crimes and anecdotes of people \"going out to dinner where they didn't go out for years.\"\n\nThe data, though, was murky. While local police data shows a short-term dip in some reported crimes after the crackdown began - especially incidents involving firearms - crime had already been trending downward in recent years. Experts who viewed the data said it's too soon to know if the crackdown had any significant or long-term impact on violent crime.\n\nAcross the city, residents were conflicted about the federal operation.\n\nFor 20 years, Charles Wilson has lived in Anacostia, a neighborhood with one of highest rates of murder and violent crime in DC. He said while he has not seen a surge of federal agents in his neighborhood, he's noticed fewer people loitering and he doesn't hear as many \"random gunshots.\"\n\n\"There's definitely been a shift, and things feel a little calmer and a little safer,\" he told USA TODAY.\n\nBut Wilson also said the assertive immigration enforcement in DC, some of which has gone viral online, \"doesn't sit well\" with him or his neighbors.\n\n\"It seems un-American and mean spirited,\" he said.\n\nLos Angeles: Raids, protests, state of emergency\n\nLos Angeles has remained one of the central targets of Trump's sweeping illegal immigration campaign and was the first American city where he deployed National Guard troops in his second term in office.\n\nFollowing ICE raids at a Home Depot and a clothing manufacturer in June, thousands of people took to the streets to protest. While demonstrations were contained to a few downtown blocks, they erupted into violence, with clashes breaking out between protesters and police, and reports of looting and property damage.\n\nTrump ordered 4,000 California National Guard troops and at least 500 Marines to protect federal personnel and property in the city. The move was challenged in court, and a California judge said the deployment was illegal but did not order the remaining soldiers to leave. Gov. Gavin Newsom said in September that the deployment had already cost taxpayers nearly $120 million.\n\nICE agents kept up their high pace of arrests, and in October the Los Angeles Board of Supervisors declared a state of emergency. Local officials said the federal agency \"created a climate of fear, leading to widespread disruption in daily life and adverse impacts to our regional economy.\"\n\nOngoing immigration raids and operations across Los Angeles County - which is home to over three million people born outside the U.S. - have led to a decline in workplace attendance and strained critical services such as schools, hospitals, and places of worship, according to the board of supervisors.\n\nLupe Lopez, 69, whose family owns nine Arteagas Food Center supermarkets, told USA TODAY she's seen a big drop in foot traffic at her family's shop in the Hispanic neighborhood of East San Jose. The reason: Young people are buying in bulk because their parents are afraid of being outside, where they might be picked up by immigration agents.\n\n\"A lot more people are either staying closer to home or not coming out at all,\" she said.\n\nContributing: Thao Nguyen, USA TODAY; Lucas Finton, Memphis Commercial Appeal",

        "title": "Kamala Harris says she may run for president again",
        "description": "Former vice president Kamala D. Harris said in an interview that she \"possibly\" will run for president, adding an early twist to what is already likely to be a hard-fought and complicated race for the 2028 Democratic presidential nomination.\n\nSpeaking to the BBC for a segment that will air Sunday, Harris said she has not yet decided whether to seek the White House for a third time.\n\nBut when she was asked if her nieces would see a woman president, Harris said, \"In their lifetime, for sure,\" and then asked if it might be her, she added, \"Possibly.\"\n\n\"I am not done,\" Harris said in the interview, part of a tour she is conducting in conjunction with the publication of her book, \"107 Days,\" about her lightning-fast campaign for the presidency last year after President Joe Biden ended his reelection campaign.\n\n\"I have lived my entire career a life of service, and it's in my bones ... There are many ways to serve. I have not decided yet what I will do in the future beyond what I am doing right now.\"\n\nHarris appeared to bristle when the interviewer, BBC's Laura Kuenssberg, suggested that Harris has not performed well in early polls for the 2028 Democratic primary race.\n\n\"I think there are all kinds of polls that will tell you a variety of things,\" the former vice president said. \"I never listen to polls. If I had listened to polls, I never would have run for my first office or my second office, and I certainly wouldn't be sitting here in this interview.\"\n\nWhile many Democrats insist they will not focus on the 2028 race until after next year's congressional elections, party leaders are privately engaged in intense conversations over what kind of image and message they should present to voters after last year's devastating second loss to President Donald Trump.\n\nAmong those considered potential candidates are several prominent governors, including California's Gavin Newsom, Illinois' JB Pritzker, Pennsylvania's Josh Shapiro, Maryland's Wes Moore and former Kentucky governor Steve Beshear. Other figures -- including former Chicago mayor Rahm Emanuel, former Transportation secretary Pete Buttigieg, Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Rep. Ro Khanna of California -- are also said to be considering running.\n\nThe race promises to be a fight between a variety of figures with vastly different ideas on how the Democratic Party can recover from the Trump era. It will feature an unusually blunt debate over what the party should be in the years to come, given the broad rejection of the Democrats by large majorities of rural voters and those without college degrees. In the meantime, the party has been slow to complete a thorough autopsy of what went wrong in 2024.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, Harris presents a complex figure for Democrats. She is appreciated by many in the party as the first woman to serve as either president or vice president, and the first Black and Asian American person to fill that role.\n\nWhen Biden abruptly ended his reelection effort in July of last year, Harris picked up the mantle and ran what many Democrats believe was an impressive campaign under very difficult circumstances.\n\nMany in the party are eager to look forward and shed any ties with the Biden era, and Harris is a reminder of a presidency that ended with voters deeply concerned about Biden's age and abilities. Harris's book is in part an effort to deal with that reality.\n\nThe former vice president wrote that it was \"recklessness\" to leave Biden to decide, along with first lady Jill Biden, whether he should have sought reelection at age 80.\n\nShe acknowledged that she \"perhaps\" should have weighed in, but she said she worried it would have looked \"incredibly self-serving\" and disloyal for her to do.\n\n\"The stakes were simply too high,\" Harris wrote in her book. \"This wasn't a choice that should have been left to an individual's ego, an individual's ambition. It should have been more than a personal decision.\"\n\nHarris's 2020 campaign for president was a notable failure, as she was forced to withdraw early in the primary season, only to be chosen as Biden's running mate once he won the nomination.\n\nHer loss last year was traumatic for many Democrats, who viewed Trump as an existential threat to American democracy. The Democratic National Committee this year has been paying down millions in debt that the Harris campaign amassed during her run.\n\nAlthough Harris says she has yet to make a decision about a 2028 run, she has taken steps that make such a candidacy possible.\n\nIn July, she said that she would not run for governor of California, passing up a race where she would have had a strong chance of victory and pointedly leaving open the door for a White House run.\n\n\"I look forward to getting back out and listening to the American people, helping elect Democrats across the nation who will fight fearlessly, and sharing more details in the months ahead about my own plans,\" she said at the time.\n\nHarris's book has given her the opportunity to not only to clarify her role in Biden's initial decision to seek reelection, but also to take shots at potential 2028 rivals, including Shapiro and Buttigieg, both of whom she considered as potential running mates last year before settling on Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.",

        "title": "These Trump court cases offer a clear roadmap to authoritarian rule",
        "description": "A view of the U.S. Supreme Court in Washington. REUTERS/Kevin Mohatt\n\nPresident Donald Trump's ICE raids in American cities are not simply efforts to deport undocumented immigrants or battle crime. In addition to creating fear and desensitizing law-abiding citizens to a military presence on American streets, Trump wanted to pick a fight.\n\nAnd he has.\n\nSpecifically, Trump wanted a legal fight that he could take to the conservative majority on the U.S. Supreme Court. If it accepts his justification for \"federalizing\" the National Guard over a state governor's objections, he'll have unrestrained power to deploy the military on American soil any time, any place, and for any reason.\n\nThe implications are staggering. Fear has gripped neighborhoods where armed troops patrol the streets as something akin to an occupying force. During the 2026 midterm elections, deployments would be a powerful voter suppression tool.\n\nIn the cases challenging Trump's National Guard deployments in Los Angeles, Portland, and Chicago, his lawyers have argued that the courts have no power to review the President's decisions. His claimed factual basis is not subject to challenge. His decision is final. His authority is absolute.\n\nTrump bases his argument on language in an 1827 case involving Jacob Mott, a state militiaman. Mott refused to report for duty when President James Madison called up the New York militia during the War of 1812. The Supreme Court ruled that Mott had no right to dispute the president's judgment.\n\nExtrapolating the language of that case involving a subordinate militiaman during a time of war to foreclose all judicial review of the factual basis for Trump's deployments is a stretch. But one appellate court judge in the ongoing ICE cases has embraced Trump's position.\n\nIn June, Trump mobilized the National Guard over the objections of Gov. Gavin Newsom. The president invoked the statute authorizing him to \"federalize\" the Guard, which permits such action only if:\n\n(1) theUnited States, or any of the Commonwealths or possessions, is invaded or is in danger of invasion by a foreign nation;\n\n(2) there is a rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the Government of the United States; or\n\n(3) the President is unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States.\" (10 U.S.C. Sec. 12406)\n\nTrump claimed that the factual circumstances entitled him to invoke subsections (2) and (3).\n\nThe trial court granted Newsom's request for a temporary restraining order, and the Trump administration appealed. Trump's primary argument was that he had unrestrained discretion to make the required statutory determinations (i.e., whether there was a rebellion, danger or rebellion, or inability with regular forces to execute federal law). Whatever he decided should be the beginning and the end of the inquiry. Actual facts contradicting his claims were out of bounds. Judges couldn't scrutinize his justifications. No one could.\n\nThe Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals (including two Trump appointees on the three-judge panel) rejected Trump's argument. The court ruled that the president's power is not absolute, but he is entitled to \"a great level of deference\" in making the required factual determinations.\n\nWhen Trump deployed troops in Portland, Oregon, the city and the state sued to block him, and he made the same argument. Federal District Court Judge Karin Immergut -- a Trump appointee -- followed the appellate court's earlier California decision and rejected it.\n\nJudge Immergut's 31-page opinion set forth her factual findings and legal conclusions. She outlined the evidence that rebutted Trump's claimed \"facts.\" The court acknowledged that \"the President is certainly entitled 'a great level of deference'... But 'a great level of deference' is not equivalent to ignoring the facts on the ground... The President's determination was simply untethered to the facts.\"\n\nJudge Immergut granted the motion to prevent the deployment.\n\nUnder well-settled law, Judge Immergut's ruling could be reversed on appeal only if it was an \"abuse of discretion\" -- which it wasn't. The appellate court had to accept her factual findings as true, unless they were \"clearly erroneous\" -- which they weren't.\n\nBut in a two-to-one vote, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed Judge Immergut's ruling. Rather than respect the trial court's detailed factual findings, the Trump-appointed majority discarded them in favor of its own characterization of the record.\n\nIronically, the court concluded, \"[T]he district court erred by placing too much weight on statements the President made on social media.\"\n\nJudge Ryan Nelson -- one of two judges comprising the majority that reversed Judge Immergut -- accepted Trump's primary argument. In his concurring opinion Judge Nelson wrote that \"the President's decision in this area is absolute.\"\n\nFacts and evidence don't matter. Everyone has to take Trump at his word -- a remarkable empowerment of a serial liar.\n\nThe dissenting opinion of Judge Susan Graber, a Clinton appointee, returned to the facts:\n\nGiven Portland protesters' well-known penchant for wearing chicken suits, inflatable frog costumes, or nothing at all when expressing their disagreement with the methods employed by ICE, observers may be tempted to view the majority's ruling, which accepts the government's characterization of Portland as a war zone, as merely absurd.\n\nBut today's decision is not merely absurd. It erodes core constitutional principles, including sovereign States' control over their States' militias and the people's First Amendment rights to assemble and to object to the government's policies and actions.\n\nJudge Graber pleaded for additional scrutiny of the majority's errant decision:\n\nBy design of the Founders, the judicial branch stands apart. We rule on facts, not on supposition or conjecture, and certainly not on fabrication or propaganda. I urge my colleagues on this court to act swiftly to vacate the majority's order before the illegal deployment of troops under false pretenses can occur.\n\nThat process -- a request for en banc review by 11 randomly-selected judges in the Ninth Circuit -- is underway.\n\nMeanwhile, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed unanimously a trial judge's order blocking Trump's deployment of the National Guard in Chicago. As in Los Angeles and Portland, Trump argued that the courts had no role in reviewing his factual determinations. The court -- including a George H. W. Bush appointee, a George W. Bush appointee, and an Obama appointee -- rejected Trump's argument.\n\nUnlike the majority in the Portland appeal, the court accepted the lower court's factual findings and applied them:\n\nPolitical opposition is not rebellion. A protest does not become a rebellion merely because the protestors advocate for myriad legal or policy changes, are well organized, call for significant changes to the structure of the US government, use civil disobedience as a form of protest, or exercise their Second Amendment right to carry firearms as the law currently allows.\n\nNor did the activity surrounding the ICE facility render federal officers incapable of executing the laws of the United States.\n\nTrump has appealed to the Supreme Court, where the conservative majority has a track record of giving him anything he wants.\n\nAs of Sept. 22, he had won 21 cases on the Court's \"shadow docket\" where little or no reasoning accompanied quick decisions granted on a \"preliminary\" basis (even though the impact often is profound and enduring).\n\nHis administration had lost only two, with two others pending. Two were withdrawn and was one dismissed.\n\nIn asking the Supreme Court to intervene, Trump's lawyers called the Seventh Circuit's ruling part of a \"disturbing and recurring pattern\" that \"improperly impinges on the President's authority and needlessly endangers federal personnel and property.\"\n\nNone of that is true. The only \"disturbing and recurring pattern\" is Trump's false assertions to justify deploying the military on American soil. And now he wants to prevent anyone challenging him -- ever.",

        "title": "Column | Republicans bet frenzied redistricting push can outrun historic trends",
        "description": "North Carolina state Rep. Pricey Harrison (D) holds an alternative map on Wednesday in Raleigh as a redistricting bill is debated. (Chris Seward/AP)\n\nThe fight for House control in next year's midterm elections has shifted into unfamiliar terrain: state capitals and courthouses.\n\nRather than recruiting candidates and conducting early fundraising, political operatives on both sides are focused on drawing new, mid-decade congressional maps. Instead of happening every 10 years after new census figures come out, both parties are engaged in an arms race in up to a dozen state legislatures.\n\nAnd depending on the partisan leanings of the emerging proposals, lawsuits from Democrats or Republicans have already started and more are likely to come.\n\nRepublicans have been more aggressive so far, but Democrats are trying to play political catch-up in states where they dominate the legislature and typically have their party's governor in place.\n\nEach day seems to bring a new development. Virginia Democrats have just begun a bank-shot effort to boost their party in a couple of districts, while Indiana Republicans continue to be divided over pushing ahead with such a move.\n\nWhen House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-New York) held a news conference on Thursday on Capitol Hill premised on the government shutdown, almost half of the 10 questions he took concerned these redistricting efforts.\n\nHe accused Republicans of trying to \"rig the midterm elections,\" boasting that under the maps in place for this 119th Congress, Democrats would do far better than picking up just the three seats needed to win the majority next fall.\n\n\"Republicans know that if the election were held today, they would lose and lose decisively,\" Jeffries contended.\n\nMeanwhile, House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-Louisiana) said in a CBS interview in late July that Republicans had the \"most favorable\" map any majority has had to defend in many years, adding that before the latest wave of redistricting had started, there were 13 Democrats who held seats in which President Donald Trump won last year.\n\n\"I'm absolutely convinced we are going to grow the House majority,\" Johnson said. He also said he expected the newly gerrymandered maps in Texas would help Republicans. \"I think the outcome probably inures to our benefit,\" Johnson said.\n\nDespite so much talk, there's a distinct chance that once all the dust settles next year, the new maps will only add up to a handful of additional seats for Republicans. In addition to a redistricting referendum driven by California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) that could help Democrats gain up to five seats, Democratic-dominated legislatures in Illinois and Maryland are considering drawing up lines to help their party.\n\nIf all the back-and-forth math is confusing, the Cook Political Report With Amy Walter is frequently updating a \"redistricting tracker\" for the latest developments and analysis, with a simple estimate at the top. It's behind a paywall but Erin Covey, the top analyst on House races, wrote that the \"likeliest scenario\" would give Republicans an additional six to nine seats to add to their very slim majority of three seats.\n\nInside Elections with Nathan Gonzales estimates a similar range.\n\n\"The best case redistricting scenarios for each party look like Republicans gaining a significant advantage in 14 seats they don't currently hold, and Democrats gaining a significant advantage in seven seats they don't currently hold,\" Jacob Rubashkin, deputy editor for Inside Elections, wrote in September.\n\nThese analyses do not account for a perhaps bigger long-term loss for Democrats, as a conservative Supreme Court majority increases the likelihood that the Voting Rights Act could be tossed aside. The current law has led to many majority-Black districts in the South, and its gutting could cost Democrats a dozen or so seats, with most of those coming in the 2028 elections.\n\nThe question for next November is: Will the midterms be fought in a small number of battlegrounds, giving Republicans a chance of holding or potentially narrowly growing their majority? Or will the election gravitate toward the traditional shellacking of the president's party?\n\nAfter three vacancies are filled, likely by year's end, the House will be back to full strength with 220 Republicans and 215 Democrats.\n\nThe optimistic case for Republicans is recent history.\n\nThe past three elections -- 2020, 2022 and 2024 -- have offered 1,305 opportunities to choose a representative (435 every two years), and the split has been almost dead even: Republicans won 655 times, Democrats 650.\n\nIt's the first time since the 1790s that the House majority stayed in the single digits after three straight elections, according to Bruce Mehlman, a former Republican analyst. And for two of those elections back then, the House had fewer than 70 total seats.\n\nIf this is the new normal, in which congressional politics is a recurring fight over a small amount of turf, Republicans could retain their majority just by padding their margin with an extra seven or eight seats through redistricting.\n\nIn this scenario, Democrats would need to pick up 10 or 12 seats to win the majority. That can seem like a tall order considering that Republicans won just nine seats in 2022, barely claiming the majority in that midterm, and Democrats gained just two last year.\n\nThe problem for Republicans is if next year's election turns into a more traditional midterm.\n\nDuring the 23 midterm elections that began in 1934 during Franklin D. Roosevelt's first term, the president's party gained seats just three times, according to the American Presidency Project.\n\nEach of those years netted just single-digit gains and came under extraordinary circumstances. In 1934, Roosevelt was trying to pull the nation out of the Great Depression. In 1998, President Bill Clinton was historically popular even as he faced an unpopular impeachment. And President George W. Bush was riding wartime popularity in 2002 after the terrorist attacks the prior year.\n\nOf the other 20 midterm elections, 16 delivered losses of at least 10 seats to the president's party. In 10 of those years, the other party gained anywhere from 30 to 81 seats.\n\nThat's what occurred in 2018 during Trump's first midterm, when his deep unpopularity led to a 40-seat loss for the GOP and handed the majority to Democrats.\n\nWhile many analysts have noted that Trump is more popular now than at this stage of his first term, that overlooks how historically disliked he is in this term.\n\nGallup's monthly poll found 37 percent of Americans approving of his job performance in late October 2017, and now Gallup has Trump's approval at 41 percent. That's on par with where Joe Biden was at this stage of his presidency (42 percent approval), but well behind every other first-year president since Dwight D. Eisenhower.\n\nRubashkin and Gonzales of Inside Elections said in September that Trump's aggressive actions so far suggest he believes the last election gave him a political mandate.\n\n\"But his overall job rating doesn't reflect that voter support. His disapproval rating is higher than his approval rating by a dozen points and upside down on key issues. That's an important data point in an election when Republicans need voters to be confident in the direction of the country,\" they wrote.\n\nRepublicans should not expect Trump, who has never hit 50 percent approval in Gallup's presidential ratings, to turn himself into Clinton (who had a 65 percent approval rating in October 1998). And maybe that's why senior Trump advisers, including Vice President JD Vance, have aggressively pushed GOP-led states to draw new gerrymandered maps.\n\nIn the 2022 midterms, Democrats outperformed expectations because of the extreme policies of many GOP nominees. They actually gained one seat in the Senate but narrowly lost the House majority.\n\nDemocrats need to set their expectations lower than the 63 seats Republicans gained in 2010 during President Barack Obama's first midterm election. They should not expect the 30-seat pickup that came in 2006 during what was called Bush's \"six-year-itch\" midterm.\n\nTheir own historically poor popularity in opinion polls has left Democratic voters miserable, longing for new leadership, but the 2006 and 2010 elections demonstrated something.\n\n\"A divided party can still win elections, as long as the party in power is unpopular,\" Rubashkin and Gonzales wrote.",

        "description": "Former vice president Kamala Harris provided a look into her run for president in her new memoir \"107 Days.\"\n\nWASHINGTON - Former Vice President Kamala Harris still isn't ruling out another presidential run.\n\nBefore offering some of her strongest hints yet that she may be reconsidering a White House bid, the Democrats' 2024 White House nominee was asked in an interview this week whether the first woman president could be her - even after losing last year to President Donald Trump.\n\n\"Possibly,\" she told the BBC, adding, \"I am not done. I have lived my entire career a life of service, and it's in my bones.\"\n\nThe 61-year old who made history as the country's first female, Black and Asian-American vice president hedged her suggestion with a few caveats, though, stressing that she has not yet decided what her own political future holds.\n\n\"There are many ways to serve,\" she said.\n\nHarris considered a run for governor in her home state of California in 2026. But she closed that door - and left another one open for the 2028 presidential contest - in July. Her decision not to enter the gubernatorial campaign effectively kickstarted the potentially crowded Democratic primary to succeed Trump in three years.\n\nYet after a bruising loss last year, the former vice president would have an uphill battle ahead of her to regain support within her party and among voters across the country. A POLITICO poll conducted over the summer showed California Democrats would slightly prefer Gavin Newsom, their current governor, over Harris in a presidential contest.\n\n\"There are all kinds of polls that will tell you a variety of things,\" Harris told the BBC. \"I've never listened to polls.\"\n\nZachary Schermele is a congressional reporter for USA TODAY.

        "title": "'Should have taken the hint!' White House fumes as Kamala Harris teases third run",
        "description": "Kamala Harris speaks in Selma, Alabama, March 3, 2024. (Raw Story/Alexander Willis)\n\nFormer Vice President Kamala Harris made her \"strongest suggestion to date\" that she was considering a third run for the White House in an interview with BBC published Saturday, sparking an attack from the White House over her failed past attempts to win the presidency.\n\nHarris was asked by BBC if she would make another bid for president following her past two attempts, to which she said \"possibly,\" BBC reported. She also noted that her grandnieces would love to see a female president \"in their lifetime, for sure.\"\n\n\"I am not done,\" Harris said, speaking with BBC. \"I have lived my entire career as a life of service and it's in my bones... If I listened to polls I would have not run for my first office, or my second office - and I certainly wouldn't be sitting here.\"\n\nHarris also went on to call President Donald Trump a \"tyrant,\" arguing that all of her warnings about him she made along the campaign trail were ultimately proven right.\n\nAsked for comment on Harris' remarks, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson dismissed her critiques of Trump in a response to BBC, and mocked the former presidential candidate as having not \"taken the hint.\"\n\n\"When Kamala Harris lost the election in a landslide, she should've taken the hint - the American people don't care about her absurd lies,\" Jackson told BBC. \"Or maybe she did take the hint and that's why she's continuing to air her grievances to foreign publications.\"\n\nAmong prospective 2028 Democratic presidential candidates, Harris continues to perform relatively strongly, coming in at second behind California Gov. Gavin Newsom in the latest ReaClearPolitics poll average, which aggregates polling data from major pollsters.\n\nWhile Harris was tight-lipped on her future plans, she didn't mince words in her interview with BBC on what she thought of Trump's second term in the White House.\n\n\"He said he would weaponise the Department of Justice - and he has done exactly that,\" Harris said.\n\n\"You look at what has happened in terms of how he has weaponized, for example, federal agencies going around after political satirists... His skin is so thin he couldn't endure criticism from a joke, and attempted to shut down an entire media organization in the process.\"",

        "title": "The nation's community health centers face money troubles",
        "description": "NEW YORK -- On a busy street in Queens, New York, just around the corner from a halal hot chicken sandwich restaurant and a barber shop, the Long Island City Health Center welcomes its patients into a brightly lit waiting room, painted baby blue and filled with soft white and gray seats.\n\nA woman working behind the desk on a recent weekday answered one patient's questions in Spanish. Other patients came dressed in hijabs, kurtas or other traditional clothing from countries around the globe. A caseworker assigned to the center rolled one woman, wheelchair-bound because of a stroke, toward an examination room.\n\nThe Long Island City Health Center is part of a national network of more than 1,300 community health centers, safety-net clinics that served more than 31 million patients in 2023, according to KFF, a health research nonprofit. The clinics are located in areas where there aren't many doctors or hospitals, and they provide care to all patients, regardless of their ability to pay.\n\nThanks largely to their broad reach, the centers have long enjoyed bipartisan support. But the federal government shutdown, freezes to federal grants, looming cuts to Medicaid and new Trump administration policies barring some immigrants from receiving care at the centers have put them under financial stress.\n\nCommunity health centers disproportionately serve low-income people, people of color and rural residents. In 2023, 90% of patients had incomes at or below 200% of the federal poverty level, according to KFF. Forty percent of patients were Hispanic, 17% were Black and 31% were rural residents.\n\nMore than 80% of patients were insured, and about half of all patients were covered by Medicaid.\n\nThe health centers are funded by the payments they get from Medicaid, Medicare and private insurers, plus federal and state grants. Money is always tight, but between 2010 and 2023, average operating margins remained in the black. That changed last year, as the average margin dipped to -2.1%, according to an audit conducted by the National Association of Community Health Centers.\n\nHalf of community health centers have fewer than 90 days of cash on hand, and one-quarter operate with margins below -4%, according to the audit.\n\nWhen the Trump administration froze some federal grants in February, it forced some clinics, particularly in rural areas, to reduce hours or shut down. The broad domestic policy law President Donald Trump signed July 4 is projected to increase the number of uninsured patients seeking care at the health centers. And the ranks of the uninsured would grow further if Affordable Care Act insurance plans get much more expensive at the end of this year, as would happen if Congress fails to extend tax credits that have kept prices down.\n\nMeanwhile, the government shutdown has prevented Congress from renewing the Community Health Center Fund, which expired on Sept. 30 and provides about 70% of the centers' federal funding. And the centers worry that a new Trump administration policy barring them from providing care to some immigrants would force them to dedicate scarce resources to verifying patients' legal status. A federal judge has temporarily blocked the change.\n\nAndrew G. Nixon, director of communications for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, told Stateline that the administration is \"fully committed to protecting America's community health centers, which play a vital role in serving millions of families nationwide.\"\n\n\"The Trump Administration is working to reopen the government and restore full funding, while also ensuring that federal resources are prioritized for American citizens and lawful residents in accordance with the law,\" Nixon said in an emailed statement.\n\nThis year, some states -- including Connecticut, Illinois and Minnesota -- approved more money for community health centers. But Illinois and Minnesota also have scaled back or ended health care programs that served low-income people regardless of their immigration status, which might prompt more of those patients to seek care at the centers. And California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom in June signed a state budget that bars immigrants who are here illegally from enrolling in the state's Medicaid program.\n\n\"Historically, health centers have had bipartisan support, but we're operating in a very different world now,\" Feygele Jacobs, a professor of health policy and management at George Washington University, told Stateline.\n\nJacobs said health centers are a target for the Trump administration because they serve people of color, low-income residents, immigrants and the uninsured.\n\n\"It's those very communities that are really being challenged right now by the administration,\" Jacobs said. \"So I don't know that the focus is so much on health centers as entities, but really more on an administration whose views are antithetical to many of the people that health centers have historically cared for.\"\n\nBut Chris Pope, a senior fellow at the conservative-leaning Manhattan Institute, questioned whether the Medicaid changes included in Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act would lead to a significant increase in the number of people without insurance or a dramatic reduction in the program's finances.\n\nPope also noted that the law doesn't take direct aim at the federal funding of community health centers.\n\n\"There's no direct cut in terms of reimbursement for community centers,\" Pope said. \"It's not the intent of the bill to slash and attack health center revenues.\"\n\nThe first community health centers were created in 1965 in Mississippi and Massachusetts as federal demonstration projects under President Lyndon Johnson's War on Poverty. The program became permanent in 1975.\n\nDoctors at the Long Island City Health Center describe it as a one-stop shop for patients. In addition to providing primary care and mental health services, the center has an in-house pharmacy and provides laboratory tests, vaccinations, drug treatment, HIV/AIDS treatment, and support for transgender patients and their families. Including its dozen medical residents, the center has doctors who can speak French, Tamil, Kru, Ibo, Yoruba, Spanish, Hindi, Nepali, Russian and Tagalog, among other languages.\n\nDr. Libby Brubaker, an attending physician at the Long Island City Health Center, told Stateline that providing a welcoming atmosphere for everybody is at the core of the center's mission.\n\n\"Our social workers go to bat for our patients and help them get access to housing. ... We write letters to allow our patients with asthma to be able to have air conditioners inside their apartments,\" Brubaker said.\n\n\"Really what we're providing for our patients is all encompassing, and that sets us apart,\" she added. \"Hospitals don't do all of those things. They do some, but being able to offer that breadth of services in an outpatient setting is invaluable.\"\n\nSandra Tap\u00eda, a Long Island City resident from Bogot\u00e1, Colombia, walked into the clinic on a Friday to see her nutritionist for the first time. She's been in the U.S. for seven years, is a green card holder and has Medicaid. She said she likes the center because \"it's close and it's safe.\"\n\nTap\u00eda said she can't imagine not being able to have access to health care, and values being able to speak to her provider in her native Spanish.\n\n\"Here, they offer really great services,\" Tap\u00eda said. \"I don't want people without as many resources, like me, to be punished.\"\n\nThe idea of cuts frightens patients such as Olga Scott, 65, who said she has been coming to Long Island City Health Center for years. Scott lives in the Bronx, but takes an hourlong subway ride to the center so she can see her favorite doctor.\n\n\"These community health services around the whole community of these five boroughs are needed -- it's really needed,\" she said. \"I just hope that they don't do too much cutbacks, because we need every service we can get.\"\n\nDr. Sindhura Manubolu, director of the family medicine program at the center, said she's sensing \"a lot of anxiety\" from her patients, especially those who rely on Medicaid.\n\n\"Most of the questions from our patients have been around, 'Oh, will we lose coverage?'\" said Manubolu, who is an immigrant from India. \"For someone to be here in an advanced country like America, and then not being able to access the health care that probably is even available to a person in a less developed country is not acceptable.\"\n\nOn Capitol Hill, community health centers are an increasingly rare example of bipartisan agreement.\n\nIn May, Republican U.S. Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi and Democratic U.S. Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island wrote a joint letter to the chairperson and ranking member of the Senate health appropriations subcommittee, urging them \"to provide robust funding\" for community health centers, describing them as \"a bipartisan solution to keeping Americans healthy and saving taxpayer dollars.\"\n\nWicker and Reed argued in the letter that the centers save the overall health care system billions of dollars by reducing the burden of chronic disease through prevention and early intervention, and lower long-term Medicaid and Medicare spending by curbing expensive emergency department visits, hospital admissions and invasive procedures. The senators also noted that the centers employ more than 310,000 people and generate more than $118 billion in economic activity.\n\n\"Republicans in particular have always argued that one of the reasons for not pushing for more insurance coverage was the fact that we have these centers,\" said Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association, which advocates for broader health care access.\n\nBenjamin noted that the centers' importance to rural, mostly Republican communities has heightened their broad-based appeal. He said draining money from them \"is not a rational decision.\"\n\n\"The administration has a nonsensical and uncoordinated health policy overall,\" Benjamin said. \"These important things that keep people alive and keep them healthy are getting caught in this very bad public policy time we're having.\"\n\nBut Robert Hayes, president and CEO of the Community Healthcare Network, the largest network of community health centers in New York City, said the centers there are determined to do what they have always done, regardless of the current challenges.\n\n\"We are secure. We're obeying the law. We're doing the right thing,\" Hayes said. \"I don't mean to dismiss the anxiety that is around health care for the vulnerable these days, but our job is to not let it distract us from what we have to do, which is important and very hard to do: [provide] the most fundamental and primary and preventative health care for people who are basically excluded from the health care system.\"",

Josh Shapiro, who has notably made a lane to the right of far-left Democratic Party figures like New York Assemb. Zohran Mamdani, will rally with Spanberger in the crucial Hampton Roads area.\n\nThe former Virginia congresswoman plans to hold multiple rallies in the Tidewater alone before Election Day, including another with former President Barack Obama across the 'roads' in Norfolk.\n\n\"Governor Shapiro this weekend is headed to New Jersey and Virginia to help elect Mikie Sherrill and Abigail Spanberger; two more Democratic governors who will focus every day on getting stuff done, delivering results for hardworking families and protecting freedom in their states,\" Shapiro campaign spokesman Manuel Bonder told Fox News Digital on Friday.\n\n2028 HOPEFUL CHALLENGES TRUMP'S JUVENILE SURGERY BAN WHILE OPPOSING WOMEN'S SPORTS BILL RESTRICTIONS\n\nShapiro also plans to stump for Rep.

JB Pritzker, Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Kentucky Gov. Andrew Beshear.\n\nHe was also the reported runner-up to Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz in Kamala Harris' 2024 veepstakes.\n\nShapiro lambasted antisemitic behavior at the University of Pennsylvania following the Hamas attack on Israel, while separately adding of Mamdani's view of the Jewish State:\n\n\"You have to speak and act with moral clarity, and when supporters of yours say things that are blatantly antisemitic, you can't leave room for that to just sit there.\"\n\nTHE ONLY TWO DEMS RUNNING FOR GOVERNOR IN 2025 ARE FORMER ROOMMATES WITH MIRRORING POLITICAL CAREERS\n\nWhile Shapiro has faced criticism from Republicans in his own state for supporting former Gov. Tom Wolf's COVID-era shutdowns and for the current budget impasse, he's also been a rare Democrat to earn praise from some in the GOP.\n\nJack Ciattarelli, the Republican nominee in New Jersey's sweeps, namedropped Shapiro favorably enough times that Newark Mayor Ras Baraka - then running for governor - suggested he cross the Delaware and run in the Keystone State instead.\n\n\"[Pennsylvania doesn't] have a property tax crisis [like New Jersey], they don't have a business climate crisis, they don't have an energy crisis,\" Ciattarelli said, contrasting the two neighbors.\n\nCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nPennsylvania Republicans, however, disputed some of those descriptions, with state Rep.

        "title": "'Stick it to Trump': Democrats spotlight president in 2025 races in bid for midterms mojo",
        "description": "Proposition 50 sparks debate over redistricting in California. It will play a substantial role in deciding which party controls the U.S. House.\n\nThe Democratic candidates for governor in New Jersey and Virginia are making opposition to Donald Trump central to their pitches. In California, an ad urges voters to \"stick it to Trump,\" while New York City's frontrunner for mayor says he'll \"stand up\" to the president of the United States if he wins.\n\nTrump's name is not on the ballot in 2025. He's a lame duck whose political retirement looms in three years. But the off-year races culminating on Nov. 4 have nonetheless put a spotlight onto the 79-year-old Republican - his likeness featured in ads, debates and on the minds of voters as America braces for its first general election since Trump won his second term nearly a year ago.\n\nDemocrats have reasons for optimism. The major 2025 races in New Jersey, Virginia and California are largely being fought on turf where Trump is both unpopular and never won his own statewide campaign. The president's opponents are hoping they can tap into the angst felt by voters such as Mary Ruehl, a 71-year-old Virginia resident who said she'd been thinking of the current White House occupant as she recently cast a ballot at an early polling location.\n\n\"I want to try to get Trump out,\" said Ruehl, a retired Air Force officer and lifelong Democrat, adding: \"He's the worst president we've ever had.\"\n\nRepublicans see things much differently. Trump is the party leader, and they're leaning into the president as much as possible with an eye on igniting the same forces that helped the GOP in 2024 to capture the White House and take full control of Congress.\n\nWhile Trump has largely stayed off the campaign trail - he's spending much of the final week before Election Day on a trip to Asia - he's hardly gone dark on politics. He's made New York mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani a frequent target as Republicans try to portray Democrats as too far left. New Jersey GOP gubernatorial nominee Jack Ciattarelli told the USA TODAY Network that he speaks to Trump every couple of weeks, and the president reupped his endorsement in a recent social media post reminding Garden State voters: \"HE WILL NEVER LET YOU DOWN!\"\n\nThe clearest thing to a referendum on Trump is in California, where Democrats are pushing voters to back the Proposition 50 redistricting ballot measure in response to the president's demands that Republicans in Texas and elsewhere in the country redraw their own House maps in favor of the GOP. The pro-Prop 50 campaign revolves around a simple message: Stopping Trump's perceived power grab and putting a check on the White House via the 2026 midterm elections that will determine who controls the House and Senate during the final two years of the Republican's second term.\n\nBrewing opposition\n\nThe aggressive opening act of Trump's second term has thrilled his supporters, as the president flexes his power in myriad ways. But backlash has also been brewing.\n\nTrump took office in January with a 51% approval rating. That's now down to 45%, according to the Real Clear Politics polling average.\n\nMillions of people protested on Oct. 18 for \"No Kings\" demonstrations across the country, the second big coast-to-coast anti-Trump rally since his inauguration in January. Democrats, meanwhile, have been performing well this year, winning a state Supreme Court seat in Wisconsin, flipping two GOP-held state Senate seats in Iowa and over-performing in dozens of other special elections from Florida to Arizona.\n\nIn 42 state legislative and U.S. congressional races across 18 states in 2025, Democrats have improved their margins by an average of more than 15% over the gap between Trump and Democrat Kamala Harris in the same districts last year, according to data collected by the political website The Downballot.\n\nDemocratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin pointed to the special election results in a recent memo to argue the party is in a \"strong position\" heading into the 2026 midterms.\n\nTrump also has been looking ahead to the midterms, arguing his record should ensure a good performance for the GOP while simultaneously fretting about the history of incumbent presidents seeing their party pummeled when voters go back to the polls two years after a White House race.\n\n\"The odds are like tremendously against,\" Trump said at a recent lunch in the Rose Garden with Senate Republicans, before declaring that \"We have to win the midterms, otherwise all the things that we've done, so many of them, are going to be taken away.\"\n\nBoth parties are hoping to come out of the November election with momentum for the more consequential 2026 contests, where control of Congress hangs in the balance, and with it Trump's agenda. A Democratic majority would block the president from passing legislation and usher in aggressive oversight of the White House.\n\nHoping to avoid that scenario, Trump is pushing red-state Republicans to give him a more favorable midterm map that helps the GOP maintain its trifecta control of Washington. Texas and Missouri have already redrawn their House maps at Trump's urging and other red states such as Florida, North Carolina, Indiana, and Kansas are contemplating their own redistricting moves.\n\nThat means the California election could be especially consequential if Democrats succeed in checking at least part of Trump's redistricting efforts.\n\nDemocrats play Trump card\n\nIn Virginia, Democratic candidate for governor Abigail Spanberger closed out her only debate with Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears by trying to tie her to Trump.\n\nSpanberger at the Oct. 9 event in Norfolk criticized Trump's tariffs and raised concerns about cuts to Virginia's workforce, which has been hit hard by the Trump administration's slashing of federal agencies. Additionally, the government shutdown has furloughed roughly 750,000 federal workers, many of them in Virginia, and left thousands more working without pay.\n\n\"I will always put Virginians first... my opponent has not done the same, putting her allegiance to Donald Trump first, no matter the cost,\" Spanberger said.\n\nEarle-Sears shot back: \"If I were taking a drink\" for every Trump comment Spanberger made \"I tell you we would be drunk by now.\"\n\nNew Jersey's Democratic candidate for governor, Mikie Sherrill, also has been eager to highlight Trump as she works to energize Democrats in a state where the president narrowed his losing margin to six percentage points last year, after he lost by 16 points in 2020. Sherrill opened her first debate with Ciattarelli by declaring \"he'll do whatever Trump tells him to do.\"\n\nFocusing on Trump could help get Democrats to the polls, so \"the Democratic candidate is doing everything she can to talk about Donald Trump all the time,\" Fairleigh Dickinson University political science professor Dan Cassino said of Sherrill.\n\nThat comes with risks, though. Democrats have struggled in recent elections when they focused too much on an anti-Trump message and not enough on solutions to pressing issues. At the same time, Trump has made gains with core Democratic-leaning groups, such as minorities and younger voters.\n\n\"They can't just run this reflexively anti-Trump campaign the way they did in 2017 when president Trump was first elected,\" said New Jersey GOP consultant Alex Wilkes.\n\nTrump weighs in\n\nThe campaign page for Earle-Sears lists dozens of endorsements from GOP leaders. Trump isn't among them.\n\nThe president didn't mention Earle-Sears during a recent appearance in Norfolk for the Navy's 250th anniversary, which she attended.\n\nAsked by reporters aboard Air Force One about the Virginia race on Oct. 19 as he was traveling back to the White House from Florida, Trump said Earle-Sears is \"excellent\" while noting he hasn't \"been too much involved in Virginia.\"\n\nTrump has endorsed in Virginia, though, backing the GOP attorney general in his race against a Democrat embroiled in a text messaging scandal.\n\nWith Earle-Sears trailing significantly in polling, Trump has focused more on the New Jersey governor's race, endorsing Ciattarelli and praising him in a recent social media post as \"A WINNER FOR NEW JERSEY!\"\n\nCiattarelli has embraced Trump's record, saying in a recent debate that he would give the president an \"A\" grade even as he tried to steer the conversation to local issues. When asked if he is part of Trump's MAGA movement, Ciattarelli said he's \"part of a New Jersey movement.\" Trump campaigned for Ciattarelli in the primary, calling into a telephone rally to declare \"New Jersey is ready to pop out of that blue horror show.\"\n\nIn their appeal to voters, Ciattarelli and his allies are blaming Democrats, who control the governor's mansion and the Legislature, for New Jersey's problems.\n\n\"This has been one party rule. Democrats have run the show,\" Wilkes said.\n\nEvery race is unique, and factors such as fundraising, candidate strength and local issues all come into play. Former New Jersey Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, a Republican turned independent who has endorsed Sherrill, acknowledged that Ciattarelli is a strong candidate, saying he is well-versed on local issues after years of involvement in state politics.\n\n\"But it's hard to get away from the statements that he's made about Trump,\" she said.\n\nTrump or Newsom?\n\nWhile GOP losses in New Jersey and Virginia could hurt party enthusiasm heading into the midterms, a loss in California would be a more tangible setback for Trump. The contest has been all about the president.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom is leading an effort to convince voters to approve a ballot measure that would allow Democrats to bypass an independent redistricting commission and draw a congressional map with more Democratic-leaning seats.\n\nTrump risks not just a setback to his redistricting power play ahead of the midterms, but delivering a victory to Newsom, his nemesis and a potential 2028 presidential candidate.\n\nCalifornia GOP consultant Matt Rexroad said the referendum has been a golden opportunity for Newsom to boost his profile and raise money.\n\n\"The question in California won't be decided on redistricting,\" Rexroad said. \"Nobody knows anything about redistricting... the election's going to be decided upon do you support President Trump or do you support Gov. Newsom.\"\n\nWhatever happens on Election Day, the results will be closely dissected for evidence of Trump's strength or weakness heading into the midterms. Sure enough, the president has said he may attend Supreme Court oral arguments on a case involving his tariff policies Nov. 5, the day after the election. It would be a striking scene, whether he endures an electoral thumping or is able to crow about a strong showing. He'll command attention either way.",

        "title": "Justice Dept. says it will monitor polls in California and New Jersey",
        "description": "The Justice Department said Friday that it will monitor polling stations in six counties in California and New Jersey ahead of the Nov. 4 general election, describing the move as routine and aimed at ensuring transparency and ballot security at the polls.\n\nThe announcement triggered criticism from Democrats, who have a growing distrust in the Trump administration's ability to act as a truly nonpartisan referee in elections, given President Donald Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election results and his more recent moves to redraw congressional maps to increase the Republican majority in Congress in next year's midterms.\n\nFederal observers will be present until Election Day at polls in Passaic County in New Jersey, and Kern, Riverside, Fresno, Orange and Los Angeles counties in southern and central California, the department said in a news release. \"Transparent election processes and election monitoring are critical tools for safeguarding our elections,\" said Harmeet K. Dhillon, who leads the Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department.\n\nHaving federal observers monitor elections is not unusual. The Justice Department posted observers throughout the country under Presidents Joe Biden, Barack Obama and George W. Bush. The 1965 Voting Rights Act allows federal examiners to ensure that voters who want to register and cast their ballots can do so.\n\nBut the DOJ announcement follows requests from the Republican state committees in the two Democratic-led states asking the Justice Department to intervene, and expressing concern about transparency in those counties.\n\nIn a letter on Monday, the New Jersey Republican State Committee asked the Justice Department to send federal observers to ensure an accurate vote count in Passaic, expressing concern about mail-in ballots -- a point of obsession for Trump despite evidence that there is negligible fraud committed through mailed ballots. The California Republican State Committee made a request the same day asking the Justice Department to intervene, according to the Associated Press.\n\nThe Justice Department's announcement also comes the day before centers open in California for early voting on Proposition 50 -- a proposal backed by Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) to redraw the state's congressional districts in favor of Democrats after Texas redrew its districts this year to favor Republicans. It also comes amid a close gubernatorial race in New Jersey.\n\nDemocratic leaders in the two states have questioned the department's motives, saying they appear designed to suppress the vote or disrupt voting at the polling stations.\n\n\"Trump is sending the DOJ to California to 'monitor' the election,\" Newsom said on social media. \"His intentions are clear -- he wants to suppress the vote. And when we win, he will falsely lay claim to fraud. We will not be intimidated. California will defend free and fair elections.\"\n\nIn an emailed statement, New Jersey Attorney General Matthew J. Platkin (D) said the Justice Department decision was \"highly inappropriate,\" and that the Constitution gives \"states, not the federal government, the primary responsibility for running elections.\"\n\n\"We are committed to ensuring that every eligible voter is able to cast their ballot and make their voices heard, and we are considering all of our options to prevent any effort to intimidate voters or interfere with our elections,\" he said.\n\nTrump has sought to create a political landscape that favors Republicans ahead of next year's midterms. He has encouraged attempts to create new red seats in Missouri, Indiana and Ohio, and to carve out as many as five in Trump's home state of Florida.\n\nTrump has also pledged to end mail-in voting, which he has tended to view as favoring Democrats, despite polls showing that a majority of Republican voters are now confident in the integrity of that form of voting. More than 70 percent of Republicans expressed confidence in mail-in ballots in the 2024 election, compared with 19 percent in 2020, according to a Pew Research Center report released in December 2024.\n\nCalifornia's Proposition 50 has gained support from Democrats, who see the proposal as a legitimate way to impede Trump's efforts. But it has also garnered opposition from moderate Republicans despite their opposition to Trump's maneuvers.\n\n\"Two wrong behaviors don't make a right behavior,\" former California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger (R) said in September.",

        "description": "Pro-life activists with 40 Days for Life gather outside abortion clinics nationwide. (Credit: 40 Days for Life)\n\nCalifornia officials are giving Planned Parenthood $140 million to keep 109 clinics open and offset the financial strain from cuts imposed by Republicans in Washington, Democrat Gov. Gavin Newsom announced.\n\nNewsom said the move affirms the state's continued commitment to abortion access for women in the Golden State amid efforts by President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans to shut down Planned Parenthood.\n\n\"California is a reproductive freedom state, and this latest investment continues to show our belief in protecting access to essential health care in times of distress,\" Newsom said in a statement on Thursday. \"Trump's efforts to defund Planned Parenthood put all our communities at risk as people seek basic health care from these community providers.\"\n\nState lawmakers will also address the issue when the legislature reconvenes in January.\n\nAPPEALS COURT HEARS MEDICAID FRAUD CASE THAT COULD COST PLANNED PARENTHOOD $1.8 BILLION\n\nPlanned Parenthood had announced it would eliminate primary care at clinics in Orange and San Bernardino counties starting in December. Five other clinics in the Bay Area, Santa Cruz and Central Valley, also shuttered in recent months over federal efforts to defund the organization.\n\nDr. Janet Jacobson, medical director of the Orange and San Bernardino counties clinics, told CalMatters the federal actions are \"destroying our primary care program.\"\n\n\"It's inhumane to take away people's health care,\" Jacobson said. \"Folks that have Medi-Cal should be able to see the provider of their choice for primary care.\"\n\nPlanned Parenthood needs about $27 million a month to operate all its local facilities, Jodi Hicks, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Affiliates of California, told CalMatters.\n\n\"The Planned Parenthood affiliates in California are grateful to Governor Newsom and our allies in the Legislature for taking this necessary step to keep Planned Parenthood health centers open and able to provide critical services as they weather the impacts of the federal defund,\" Hicks said in a statement.\n\nCalifornia is the fourth state to allocate public funds to support Planned Parenthood, joining Washington, Colorado and New Mexico. Lawmakers in Oregon and New York are also considering giving public money to the organization.\n\nDEMOCRATS ESCALATE ANTI-TRUMP LAWFARE BY TARGETING CONGRESS IN PLANNED PARENTHOOD FUNDING FIGHT\n\nRepublicans in the nation's capital and across the country have targeted Planned Parenthood over abortion services. Trump's spending bill signed over the summer prohibited Planned Parenthood from receiving Medicaid money for its services, including abortions, mammograms, pap smears, birth control and sexually transmitted infection testing.\n\nFacilities in GOP-led states with abortion restrictions have also been forced to cease the procedures following the 2022 Supreme Court decision that overturned Roe V. Wade and returned the power to make laws regarding abortion back to the states.\n\nPlanned Parenthood facilities have been shuttering in various states across the country, including California and New York. Planned Parenthood Mar Monte -- which operates 30 health centers along the California coast, Central Valley and Nevada -- shuttered five health centers in July after Trump blocked Planned Parenthood's funding.\n\nMar Monte Chief of Staff Andrew Adams said the organization is working on ways to maintain its financial stability. Adams said the closures helped keep services at the organization's other clinics until the end of the year but that it could be met with a \"financial cliff\" in the new year.\n\nPRO-LIFE GROUP 'ELATED' AFTER PLANNED PARENTHOOD SHUTTERS HOUSTON FACILITIES: 'TREMENDOUS VICTORY'\n\n\"We are planning for an environment where there is no federal funding,\" Adams told CalMatters. \"What that looks like is having to potentially charge patients some amount of money for services we provide.\"\n\nThe organization has claimed that abortions make up only 3% of its services, but pro-life groups contend that the clinics' closures in states with abortion bans prove that to be false.\n\nCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"If that were true, they wouldn't be closing all these facilities in pro-life states where you can't do abortions. So that's hardly believable anymore in 2025,\" 40 Days for Life CEO and founder Shawn Carney told Fox News Digital in August.\n\nNewsom, California lawmakers and Planned Parenthood have spent much of the year searching for a solution to keep the organization afloat without federal dollars, according to CalMatters.\n\nBut with a multibillion-dollar state deficit, that has been a challenging goal.",

        "description": "\"I think he is standing up. I think he's pushing back,\" the governor of Kentucky says\n\nAndy Beshear stood by his Democrat peer Gavin Newsom after Bill Maher called out the latter's social media trolling of Donald Trump.\n\nThe governor of Kentucky, who appeared on \"Real Time With Bill Maher\" Friday, maintained a united front for the Democratic party, as he vocally applauded his fellow governor for the work he's done in California.\n\nThe discussion kicked off when Maher suggested Newsom -- who has repeatedly mimicked Trump's feisty social media style on X this year -- had \"jumped the shark\" with his online antics.\n\n\"Is that something you endorse? Do you think it's an effective technique? Would you do it? Should we keeping doing? Should we stop doing it?\" Maher grilled the Southern politician.\n\nInitially, Beshear didn't address Newsom's social media behavior and instead addressed the Calif. governor's Prop 50 measure, which will authorize temporary changes to the state's congressional district maps -- directly combating similar action being done in Texas.\n\n\"He taking the fight back,\" Beshear noted. \"I wish we didn't have to be there. I wish we didn't have to do it. But, once Texas changed the rules of the game, we all have to play by the same rules. And so, I appreciate his leadership there.\"\n\nMaher then cut Beshear off, noting this wasn't an example of trolling, rather a strategy tackling a real issue.\n\n\"He's pushing back in his way,\" Beshear went on. \"It's not my way. It's just not me. But I think everybody has to take their style and do what's best for their people. But I think he is standing up. I think he's pushing back and I think it takes all of us in our own ways.\"\n\nBeshear later expressed that he was feeling optimistic heading into midterm elections.\n\n\"I think people don't like extremism and people feel the country may have swung too far one way and now is swinging too far the other way and it's impacting their daily lives,\" he concluded. \"But, even before we get to midterms, the Democrats are going to win the governorship of both New Jersey and Virginia.

        "description": "California Gov. Gavin Newsom slammed President Donald Trump's administration with a fact check over its latest effort to claim his state's tolerance of immigrants is getting people killed.\n\nThe controversy stems from a Fox News report from Bill Melugin, posted to X on Friday, that \"An official with the California State Transportation Agency confirms to @FoxNews that Indian illegal alien truck driver Jashanpreet Singh's California CDL is also a federal REAL ID, 'which he was entitled to receive given the federal gov's confirmation of his legal status.'\" Singh is currently facing charges for a deadly DUI.\n\nAfter this post went up, the official account for the Department of Homeland Security blasted Newsom over the incident.\n\n\"Newsom's pro-illegal alien policies COST LIVES. Now that California's policies have led to disaster, he's attempting to shift the blame,\" said the account. \"In Gavin Newsom's California, possessing employment authorization is enough to grant someone a commercial driver's license (CDL). CALIFORNIA is solely responsible for deciding who they give a CDL to. California's sanctuary state policies are 100% to blame for providing an individual who was NOT an American citizen, and did NOT have legal status with a CDL. Now Gavin's actions have killed Americans.\"\n\nNewsom, though, was quick to hit back, and accused the Trump administration of lying.\n\n\"Lies. Kosplay Kristi and Road Rules Duffy can't keep their story straight!\" said the account for Newsom's press office. First, the post said, \"Noncitizens are eligible for CDLs -- Kristi and Sean should know that!\" Second, \"They say he is 'illegal' but the Trump Admin CONFIRMED his legal presence and renewed his work permit ... The Trump Admin renewed his work authorization -- allowing him to be eligible for a CDL.\"\n\n\"And since Kristi and Sean need reminding: CA-licensed CDL holders are involved in fatal crashes at a rate FAR BELOW the national average,\" Newsom's account added. \"They may want to look into Texas, which has a 50% HIGHER rate than California.\"\n\nNewsom has emerged as one of the most confrontational Democratic governors on social media, often trolling Trump by writing manifestos in his own writing style -- and engineering a redistricting plan, to be decided by voters next month, that retaliates against the GOP's mid-decade gerrymanders at Trump's orders.",

        "title": "Kevin Kiley's District 3 among those targeted for change under California's Proposition 50",
        "description": "With Election Day now less than two weeks away, one of California's congressional districts that would see some of the biggest changes if Proposition 50 passes is District 3, represented by Republican Congressman Kevin Kiley.\n\nMany District 3 voters are watching closely to see how Proposition 50's outcome could affect who speaks for them in Washington.\n\n\"This is about one thing and one thing alone, it's about our elections in California,\" Kiley said.\n\nKiley has been representing California's third district for the past two years.\n\nHis seat is one of five being targeted through Proposition 50, which would redraw California's congressional districts to be more favorable to Democrats in next year's midterm election.\n\nKiley's district currently runs from Roseville, north to Plumas County and down to Death Valley.\n\nBut if Proposition 50 passes, the lines would shift, still covering the foothills and Sierra, but losing Roseville and Rocklin. Instead, it would stretch around to include parts of Sacramento.\n\n\"I very much hope that I'll get to continue to represent the beautiful district I do now, the third district as currently constituted,\" Kiley said.\n\nGovernor Gavin Newsom says the Proposition 50 push is in direct response to similar efforts in Texas to create five Republican congressional districts.\n\nBut Kiley is pushing legislation at the federal level to ban all mid-decade redistricting nationwide.\n\n\"Honestly, we need to work in Congress to find some reform so we don't have gerrymandering at all by the time we have the next census,\" Kiley said.\n\n\"I would not like if the lines were changed because I moved to Placer County for the conservative Republican feel that it gives,\" a voter said.\n\n\"I think if redistricting is a tool, we should go for it,\" another voter said.\n\n\"If this does go through, essentially, you have to win over a certain percentage of voters in order to win if there is a new map. How do you approach that?\" CBS Sacramento reporter Conor McGill asked Kiley.\n\n\"It's not one particular type of voter or constituent we're serving, it's everyone,\" Kiley said. \"And I think that's why I think, regardless whatever attempt they make or whatever shape it ends up being, we'll have a very strong case to make with voters.\"\n\nThree democrats have already announced campaigns to unseat Kiley in next year's midterm elections.\n\nKiley has represented California's District 3 since 2022, winning with 53.6% of the votes. Kiley was reelected in 2024 with 55.9% of the votes.\n\nDemocrat John Garamendi was the last Democrat elected to represent California's District 3, but he moved his candidacy to District 8 following the 2020 Census and redistricting cycle that shifted District 3's partisan lean towards counties that have reliably voted Republican in recent years.\n\nIn the 2024 Presidential Election, President Trump won the district with 50.3% of the votes, whereas former Vice President Kamala Harris received 46.5% of the votes.\n\nAccording to September data published by the California Secretary of State, nearly 39% of voters in District 3 are registered Republicans, with about 32% of voters being registered Democrats.",

        "title": "Damning DOT report blames Newsom for illegal immigrant trucker's...",
        "description": "California Gov. Gavin Newsom violated federal law by upgrading the driver's license of the illegal migrant trucker accused of causing a horrific, drug-fueled pile-up that killed three people and wounded several others, a bombshell new report claims.\n\nTransportation Secretary Sean Duffy blamed Newsom for Tuesday's deadly crash, alleging state officials unlawfully upgraded Jashanpreet Singh's commercial license weeks after a new federal rule went into effect barring illegal immigrants from holding such privileges, according to a DOT report released Friday.\n\nThe restrictions, which require states to verify an applicant's legal status, took effect on Sept. 26 -- while the 21-year-old Indian national's driving rights were expanded on Oct. 15, the report states.\n\n\"My prayers are with the families of the victims of this tragedy,\" Duffy said in a statement.\n\n\"It would have never happened if Gavin Newsom had followed our new rules. California broke the law and now three people are dead and two are hospitalized. These people deserve justice. There will be consequences.\"\n\nSingh was initially issued a restricted CDL in the Golden State on June 27, confining him to intrastate travel, according to the DOT's report.\n\nWhen the new regulations took effect, the federal agency informed California officials of \"significant compliance failures\" related to the issuance of truckers' licenses and gave them 30 days to audit its practices and void or rescind all unexpired CDLs, the report states.\n\nThe state's Department of Motor Vehicles lifted Singh's driving restrictions on Oct. 15 -- his birthday -- without enforcing the stricter standards mandated by the DOT's new emergency rule, officials said.\n\n\"Gavin Newsom was explicitly warned California's CDL program was dangerously broken,\" the report charged.\n\n\"The USDOT's emergency rule was issued to explicitly prevent drivers like Singh from getting behind the wheel of commercial motor vehicles.\"\n\nNewsom's office did not immediately respond to The Post's request for comment.\n\nSingh was allegedly under the influence of drugs when he plowed his semi-truck into slow-moving traffic on the 10 Freeway in San Bernardino County Tuesday afternoon, cops said.\n\nThe wreck, which was caught on dashcam, killed three people and left at least four others injured.\n\nHarrowing footage showed the moment Singh allegedly slammed his red big rig into the back of an SUV -- before crashing into several other vehicles and erupting into flames.\n\nSingh is believed to have entered the US in 2022 via the southern border before he was released into the country by the Biden administration, Department of Homeland officials said.\n\nUS Immigration and Customs Enforcement has since lodged an arrest detainer -- a former request for local cops to notify the feds before he is freed.\n\nHe was charged with vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated and driving under the influence.",

        "title": "Justice Department Will Monitor Elections in California and New Jersey",
        "description": "The Trump administration said on Friday that the Justice Department will monitor polling sites in California and New Jersey ahead of the Nov. 4 election, amid requests by Republican Party officials in those states.\n\nAlthough election monitoring by the Justice Department is not uncommon, it will likely heighten tensions as voters weigh in on some of the nation's most closely watched races. President Trump has pushed the Justice Department to pursue parts of his agenda, including going after his political enemies, which has eroded its traditional independence. Mr. Trump also blamed his 2020 election loss on rigged voting, although there was no evidence of widespread voter fraud.\n\nVoter fraud is exceedingly rare, but Mr. Trump and other Republicans have since claimed it is rampant, particularly voting by mail, which is how most Californians vote. Democrats have called the argument a ruse for voter suppression.\n\n\"This administration has made no secret of its goal to undermine free and fair elections,\" Brandon Richards, a spokesman for Gov. Gavin Newsom of California, said in a statement. \"Deploying these federal forces appears to be an intimidation tactic meant for one thing: suppress the vote.\"\n\nBoth California and New Jersey are led by Democrats and have key races or issues on the ballot that could affect the balance of power between the parties.\n\nIn New Jersey, Representative Mikie Sherrill, a Democrat, and Jack Ciattarelli, a Republican, are running in a close race to succeed Gov. Phil Murphy.\n\nIn California, Democrats are looking to a ballot measure, Proposition 50, to improve their chances of regaining control of the House in next year's midterm elections. The measure asks voters to revise California's congressional districts to favor Democrats in response to recent redistricting measures by Republican-led states such as Texas to favor their party.\n\nThe Justice Department's announcement followed complaints last weekend by the New Jersey Republican Party that Democratic members of the Board of Elections in Passaic County had blocked the use of security cameras in ballot storage areas and refused to require a sign-in log for workers with access to mail-in ballots.\n\nThen on Monday, the chairwoman of the California Republican Party, Corrin Rankin, wrote to the Justice Department, complaining that the party had received \"reports of irregularities\" in some counties that they feared \"will undermine either the willingness of voters to participate in the election or their confidence in the announced results of the election.\"\n\nThe letter asked for monitors to be sent to five counties where, the party asserted, some voters had received incorrect ballots in past elections and where Republicans had raised concerns about the maintenance and accuracy of voter lists.\n\nThe Justice Department said in a news release that personnel from the agency's Civil Rights Division would be stationed at polling places and offices of registrars of voters \"to ensure transparency, ballot security, and compliance with federal law.\"\n\nThe department said those workers would coordinate with the local U.S. attorney's offices, but it did not specify how many observers would be deployed or the types of irregularities they would seek.\n\n\"This Department of Justice is committed to upholding the highest standards of election integrity,\" Attorney General Pamela Bondi said in a statement. \"We will commit the resources necessary to ensure the American people get the fair, free, and transparent elections they deserve.\"\n\nCalifornia mails ballots to all registered voters, and most votes are cast by mail, with polling locations where voters can drop their ballots off in person if they prefer not to send them. In last November's election, 81 percent of voters in California voted by mail, according to the Secretary of State's office.\n\nDemocrats greeted the announcement with skepticism, saying the move was a politically motivated effort to disrupt consequential votes in November.\n\nShirley Weber, California's secretary of state, said that the Justice Department provided no justification for deploying monitors \"in what is a nonfederal special election.\"\n\n\"We will not permit tactics masquerading as oversight to erode voter confidence or intimidate Californians,\" she said. \"Our voters have earned the right to cast their ballots free from surveillance or interference -- from anyone.\"\n\nThe Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department enforces a range of statutes that protect the right to vote, and election officials say such monitoring has been conducted in the past under both Republican and Democratic administrations.\n\nIn 2022, under the Biden administration, the department monitored compliance with federal voting rights laws in 64 jurisdictions in 24 states for that year's general election. In 2024, it sent monitors to elections in 86 jurisdictions, including all of the major swing states.\n\nSince 2020, when President Trump falsely claimed that he had lost because Democrats had stolen the election, MAGA Republicans have maintained a relentless focus on voter fraud and have trained election observers to aggressively search for possible irregularities at polling places.\n\nScores of recounts, audits and studies, some conducted by Republicans, in the wake of Mr. Trump's loss in 2020 turned up no evidence of widespread problems with the vote, nor has any evidence materialized in more recent elections.\n\nNonetheless, in recent months, the Justice Department has sued at least a half-dozen states, including California, demanding detailed voter data, ostensibly to ensure that ineligible voters were being removed from official rosters.\n\nIn California, federal officials said monitors would be stationed in Los Angeles, Orange and Riverside Counties -- three of the most heavily populated areas of Southern California -- and across Fresno and Kern counties in the Central Valley. The targeted counties represent a population of some 17 million people and include some of the most heavily Latino areas of the state.\n\nDean Logan, the registrar-recorder for Los Angeles County, said in a statement that federal monitors, \"like all election observers,\" were welcome to observe election activities at designated locations. He added that \"the presence of election observers is not unusual and is a standard practice across the country.\"\n\nIn New Jersey, Justice Department officials said they would monitor polling in populous and immigrant-heavy Passaic County.\n\n\"If there's nothing to hide or wrong, why the concern in having the DOJ observe the elections departments?\" the California Republican Party asked in a social media post on Friday that tagged Mr. Newsom's office. \"Isn't transparency a good thing that only strengthens trust in our process, system, and government?\"",

        "title": "DOJ prepares to send election monitors to California, New Jersey following requests from state GOPs",
        "description": "LOS ANGELES -- The Department of Justice is preparing to send federal election observers to California and New Jersey next month, targeting two Democratic states holding off-year elections following requests from state Republican parties.\n\nThe DOJ announced Friday that it is planning to monitor polling sites in Passaic County, New Jersey, and five counties in southern and central California: Los Angeles, Orange, Kern, Riverside and Fresno. The goal, according to the DOJ, is \"to ensure transparency, ballot security, and compliance with federal law.\"\n\n\"Transparency at the polls translates into faith in the electoral process, and this Department of Justice is committed to upholding the highest standards of election integrity,\" Attorney General Pamela Bondi said in a statement to The Associated Press.\n\nElection monitoring is a routine function of the Justice Department, but the focus on California and New Jersey comes as both states are set to hold closely-watched elections with national consequences on Nov. 4. New Jersey has an open seat for governor and California is holding a special election aimed at redrawing the state's congressional map to counter Republican gerrymandering efforts elsewhere ahead of the 2026 midterms.\n\nThe DOJ's efforts are the latest salvo in the GOP's preoccupation with election integrity after President Donald Trump spent years refusing to accept the results of the 2020 election and falsely railing against mail-in voting as rife with fraud. Democrats fear the new administration will attempt to gain an upper hand in next year's midterms with similarly unfounded allegations of fraud.\n\nThe announcement comes days after the Republican parties in both states wrote letters to the DOJ requesting their assistance. Some leading Democrats in the states blasted the decision.\n\nNew Jersey Attorney General Matt Platkin called the move \"highly inappropriate\" and said the DOJ \"has not even attempted to identify a legitimate basis for its actions.\"\n\nThe letter from the California GOP, sent Monday and obtained by the AP, asked Harmeet Dhillon, who leads the DOJ's Civil Rights Division, to provide monitors to observe the election in the five counties.\n\n\"In recent elections, we have received reports of irregularities in these counties that we fear will undermine either the willingness of voters to participate in the election or their confidence in the announced results of the election,\" wrote GOP Chairwoman Corrin Rankin.\n\nThe state is set to vote Nov. 4 on a redistricting proposition that would dramatically redraw California's congressional lines to add as many as five additional Democratic seats to its U.S. House delegation.\n\nCalifornia is one of at least eight states the Justice Department has sued as part of a wide-ranging request for detailed voter roll information involving at least half the states. The department has not said why it wants the data.\n\nBrandon Richards, a spokesman for Gov. Gavin Newsom, said the DOJ has no standing to \"interfere\" with California's election because the ballot contains only a state-specific initiative and has no federal races.\n\n\"Deploying these federal forces appears to be an intimidation tactic meant for one thing: suppress the vote,\" he said in an email.\n\nBut Orange County Registrar of Voters Bob Page said it's common to have local, state, federal and even international observers and welcomes anyone who wants to watch the county's operations.\n\nLos Angeles County Clerk Dean Logan said election observers are standard practice across the country and that the county, with 5.8 million registered voters, is continuously updating and verifying its voter records.\n\n\"Voters can have confidence their ballot is handled securely and counted accurately,\" he said.\n\nMost Californians vote using mail ballots returned through the postal service, drop boxes or at local voting centers. But in pursuit of accuracy and counting every vote, the nation's most populous state has gained a reputation for tallies that can drag on for weeks - and sometimes longer.\n\nIn 2024, it took until early December to declare Democrat Adam Gray the winner in his Central Valley district, the final congressional race to be decided in the nation last year.\n\nCalifornia's request echoed a similar letter sent by New Jersey Republicans asking the DOJ to dispatch election monitors to \"oversee the receipt and processing of vote-by-mail ballots\" and \"monitor access to the Board of Elections around the clock\" in suburban Passaic County ahead of the state's governor's race.\n\nThe New Jersey Republican State Committee told Dhillon that federal intervention was necessary to ensure an accurate vote count in the heavily Latino county that was once a Democratic stronghold, but shifted to President Donald Trump's column in last year's presidential race.\n\nThe county could be critical to GOP gubernatorial nominee Jack Ciattarelli's hopes against Democrat Mikie Sherrill.\n\nThe letter, which cited previous voter fraud cases in the county and alleged a \"long and sordid history\" of vote-by-mail shenanigans, came after Republicans said Democratic members of the Passaic County Board of Elections voted against implementing additional security measures, including using cameras in ballot storage areas.\n\nIn 2020, a judge ordered a new election for a city council seat in Paterson - the largest city in Passaic County - after the apparent winner and others were charged with voter fraud.\n\n\"The reason that we have concerns about this is because there's been a significant history of fraud,\" said Kate Gibbs, executive director of the NJGOP, which is also weighing whether to request additional DOJ monitoring in a number of other counties.\n\nPlatkin said the state is committed to ensuring its elections are fair and secure. With the DOJ's announcement, he said the attorney general's office is \"considering all of our options to prevent any effort to intimidate voters or interfere with our elections.\"\n\nLocal election offices and polling places around the country already have observers from both political parties to ensure rules are followed. The DOJ also has a long history of sending observers to jurisdictions that have histories of voting rights violations to ensure compliance with federal civil rights laws.\n\nTrump has for years railed against mail voting as part of his repeated false claims that former President Joe Biden's victory in 2020 was rigged. He alleges it is riddled with fraud, even though numerous studies have found no evidence of widespread fraud in U.S. elections.\n\nEarlier this year, Trump pledged to ban vote-by-mail across the country, something he has no power to do under the U.S. Constitution.\n\nThe DOJ's effort will be overseen by Dhillon's Civil Rights Division, which will deploy personnel in coordination with U.S. attorney's offices and work closely with state and local officials, the department said.\n\nThe department also is soliciting further requests for monitoring in other jurisdictions.\n\nDavid Becker, a former DOJ attorney who has served as an election monitor and trained them, said the only federal laws the department has the jurisdiction to enforce in state elections are ones that prevent discrimination against racial minorities.\n\n\"It's a very high bar to justify Washington's intervention into state-only elections,\" said Becker, executive director of the Center for Election Integrity & Research.\n\nStill, Becker said that if monitors obey rules about not interacting with voters, poll workers or ballot counting, \"I don't think this is going to make any difference for voters.\"\n\n___\n\nColvin reported from New York.

        "title": "Trump says tech leaders and mayor changed his mind about using federal force in San Francisco",
        "description": "SAN FRANCISCO -- President Donald Trump was geared up for a show of federal force in San Francisco, a city he's blasted as everything wrong with liberal governance. Then conversations with some of the Bay Area's most prominent tech leaders and the mayor changed his mind.\n\n\"I got a great call from some incredible people, some friends of mine, very successful people,\" Trump told reporters Thursday at the White House, specifically referencing Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia, one of the world's most valuable tech companies, and Marc Benioff, CEO of software company Salesforce.\n\nHe said they told him San Francisco was working hard to reduce crime. \"So we are holding off that surge, everybody. And we're going to let them see if they can do it,\" Trump said. He said he could change his mind if it \"doesn't work out.\"\n\nTrump said the increased federal force had been planned for Saturday. He didn't specify whether he was just referring to National Guard troops, which he had threatened to send in, or if he would also halt a potential ramp up of immigration enforcement. U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents arrived at a U.S. Coast Guard base near the city on Thursday morning, drawing protesters.\n\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement informed Alameda County Sheriff Yesenia Sanchez that the operation had been called off for the entire Bay Area, a nine-county region of about 8 million people, Sgt. Roberto Morales, a spokesman for the sheriff, said Friday.\n\nOutreach from billionaire CEOs clearly had a hand in the rare reprieve Trump handed a Democrat-led city. But Trump also credited Mayor Daniel Lurie, who has worked to avoid direct confrontation with the Republican president since both took office in January. Lurie has governed as an earnest and relentless cheerleader of San Francisco, and repeatedly refused to weigh in on national politics or to mention Trump's name.\n\nInstead, he's focused on local issues - public safety, luring back business and reversing the city's pandemic-fueled decline. When Trump said repeatedly earlier this week that he'd send the National Guard into San Francisco to quell crime, Lurie noted overall crime is down 26% compared to last year and car break-ins are at a 22-year low.\n\n\"I told the mayor, I love what you're doing, I respect it, and I respect the people that are doing it,\" Trump said, referencing a phone call the two had Wednesday.\n\nAn heir to the Levi Strauss fortune and anti-poverty philanthropist, Lurie is a centrist Democrat who had never held office until he ousted then-Mayor London Breed in last November's election. He has stated no other political aspirations than to improve the city and has said that he will work with anyone who wants to do the same.\n\n\"I told him the same thing I told our residents,\" Lurie said at a Thursday afternoon news conference to address his call with the president. \"San Francisco is on the rise. Visitors are coming back, buildings are getting leased and purchased, and workers are coming back to the office.\"\n\nLurie said he told Trump that he welcomes the city's \"continued partnership\" with the Drug Enforcement Agency and other federal authorities to get illegal narcotics off the streets and contribute to San Francisco's falling crime rates. Fentanyl has been a major scourge on the city's streets.\n\n\"But having the military and militarized immigration enforcement in our city will hinder our recovery,\" Lurie said.\n\nFormer U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a San Francisco Democrat, praised Lurie on social media, saying that he \"has demonstrated exceptional leadership.\" Steve Kerr, Golden State Warriors head coach, called him an \"absolute superstar\" responsible for the good things happening in San Francisco.\n\nThe office of California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a former San Francisco mayor, said on X that, \"Trump, has finally, for once, listened to reason.\" Newsom, for his part, has repeatedly sparred with Trump, particularly after Trump deployed the California National Guard to Los Angeles against Newsom's wishes.\n\nBut others are skeptical that Trump will keep his word. Indeed, Trump said he was giving Lurie \"a chance\" to turn things around and said the federal government could \"take criminals out\" much faster.\n\n\"We cannot trust Trump,\" said San Francisco Supervisor Connie Chan, a progressive who runs politically left of Lurie but has a good working relationship with the mayor.\n\nSan Francisco Supervisor Jackie Fielder, who is also more politically liberal than Lurie, said in a statement that she disagrees with Lurie's desire to coordinate more with federal law enforcement, saying that \"is a dangerous invitation to a fascist administration.\"\n\nTrump said he received \"four or five calls\" from business leaders urging him not to send federal force and to let city leaders continue to work on reducing crime.\n\n\"They're the biggest people in the world, a lot of the high tech,\" he said at the White House. \"They want to do it. And I said, 'I am so honored to let you do it. And if it doesn't work out, we'll do it for you very quickly.'\"\n\nBenioff of Salesforce, who also owns Time magazine, told the New York Times earlier this month that he'd welcome Guard troops to help quell crime ahead of his major annual business conference. He quickly face backlash and then apologized, saying the troops weren't needed. He confirmed to The Associated Press that he spoke to Trump but did not provide more details. Nvidia declined to comment.\n\nIn announcing his decision to back off a surge, Trump did not mention other cities in the Bay Area, including Oakland, where he has also threatened to send in federal troops.\n\nSome other Democrats who have also taken a less combative approach to Trump have avoided his focus as he deploys Guard troops around the country. He has not, for example, focused on Detroit despite criticism of the city. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has tried to engage with Trump including with White House visits.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press journalists Mike Liedtke and Olga R. Rodriguez in San Francisco contributed.",

They issued \"multiple verbal commands\" to stop, but the driver failed to comply, \"suddenly accelerating backwards at a high rate of speed directly toward them,\" the statement said.\n\n\"When the vehicle's actions posed a direct threat to the safety of Coast Guard and security personnel, law enforcement officers discharged several rounds of defensive live fire.\"\n\nThe driver was wounded in the stomach and was expected to survive, the statement said. Homeland Security didn't specify whether the driver was shot.\n\nThe FBI was investigating.\n\n\"At this time, the incident appears to be isolated, and there is no known current threat to the public,\" FBI spokesperson Cameron Polan in San Francisco said in a statement. No other details were immediately released.\n\nVideo from the scene showed what appeared to be a U-Haul truck trying to back into the base.\n\n\"U-Haul is assisting law enforcement to meet any investigative needs they have,\" company spokesperson Jeff Lockridge said in a statement.\n\nEarlier Thursday, protesters had assembled at the island, with many singing hymns and carrying signs saying, \"Protect our neighbors\" and \"No ICE or troops in the Bay,\" a reference to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the National Guard.\n\nHours earlier, President Donald Trump had called off a planned surge of federal agents into San Francisco to quell crime. Mayor Daniel Lurie and Gov. Gavin Newsom said it was unnecessary because crime is on the decline.\n\nSeparately, U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents began arriving at the Coast Guard base in the region earlier Thursday for a possible ramp up of immigration enforcement, a move that drew several hundred protesters.\n\nTrump said he backed off after speaking to the mayor and several prominent business leaders who said they're working hard to clean up the city.\n\nThat decision was in contrast to others made by Trump to send the military into Democratic-run cities over fierce resistance from mayors and governors.\n\nThe deployment of National Guard troops on the streets of Washington faced challenges in two courts on Friday - one in the nation's capital and another in West Virginia - while across the country a judge in Portland, Oregon, was considering whether to let Trump deploy troops there. Deployment remains blocked in the Chicago area.\n\nCoast Guard Island is a 67-acre (27-hectare) human-made island formed in 1913 in the Oakland Estuary between Oakland and Alameda. It is federally owned, does not allow visits from the general public without an escort or specific government identification, and it has been home to the current base, Base Alameda, since 2012, according to a Coast Guard document from 2016.\n\nBase Alameda provides a variety of services for Coast Guard activities throughout the West Coast.",

        "description": "Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche joins 'Fox & Friends' to discuss Rep. Nancy Pelosi's controversial comments calling on local police to arrest ICE agents.\n\nFormer House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's comments calling for the arrest of federal ICE agents drew fiery criticism Friday and a letter of warning from the Trump administration.\n\nRep. Pelosi, D-Calif., said in a statement earlier this week that local police could \"arrest federal agents if they break California law.\"\n\n\"And if they are convicted, the President cannot pardon them,\" Pelosi and Rep. Kevin Mullin said in a joint statement.\n\nRep. Pelosi's warning is part of a growing effort among Democrats to challenge federal immigration enforcement as the Trump administration intensifies its crackdown.\n\nDeputy Attorney General Todd Blanche pushed back. He said local officers have no authority to detain federal officers carrying out their duties.\n\nPRITZKER CLAIMS YOU 'CAN'T BELIEVE ANYTHING ICE IS DOING,' SUGGESTS IT'S COMMITTING 'FELONIES'\n\n\"You cannot touch federal agents when they're doing their job,\" Blanche said on \"Fox & Friends\" Friday.\n\n\"That's something that they know. It's something that we reminded them of last night, because if you do, you're committing a crime.\"\n\nBlanche was referring to a letter he sent Thursday to top California officials, including Pelosi and Gov. Gavin Newsom, warning them not to interfere with federal law enforcement operations. The letter stated that arresting federal agents during official duties is \"illegal and futile.\"\n\nDOJ WARNS CALIFORNIA OFFICIALS TO 'STAND DOWN OR FACE PROSECUTION' AFTER THREATS TO ARREST ICE AGENTS\n\nPelosi's comments follow similar criticism of ICE operations from other Democratic leaders, including Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker.\n\n\"If you're an ICE agent, and you do these things, we think you ought to be held accountable. And yet no one in Washington, no one above them, no supervisor, no inspector general is holding anybody accountable,\" Pritzker said on \"Special Report\" Thursday.\n\n\"There literally haven't been any suspensions or firings for the terrible things that they've done,\" he added.\n\n5 TIMES DEMOCRATS BLASTED ICE WITH HARSH RHETORIC\n\nBlanche said the comments from Pelosi and Pritzker undermine the administration's mission to make the country safer.\n\n\"What the congresswoman did yesterday, what the governor of Illinois said yesterday, does nothing but harm this country,\" Blanche said.\n\nPritzker also accused ICE agents of racial profiling rather than focusing on removing violent criminals.\n\nBlanche rejected that claim, defending the agency's actions and calling the accusations \"disgusting.\"\n\n\"These false claims that our ICE agents, that our federal law enforcement officers are somehow racial profiling or doing the wrong thing in executing and doing their jobs. And courts have said that we're right, and the Democrats are wrong.\"",

        "title": "Deadly semitrailer crash in California renews federal criticism of immigrant truck drivers",
        "description": "A 21-year-old semitruck driver accused of being under the influence of drugs and causing a fiery crash that killed three people on a southern California freeway is in the country illegally, U.S. Homeland Security officials said Thursday.\n\nJashanpreet Singh was arrested and jailed after Tuesday's eight-vehicle crash in Ontario, California, that also left four people injured.\n\nHe faces three counts of vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated and driving under the influence causing injury, the San Bernardino District Attorney's office said.\n\nSingh is scheduled for arraignment Friday. The district attorney's office said he does not yet have a lawyer.\n\nSingh, of Yuba City, California, is from India and entered the U.S. illegally in 2022 across the southern border, Homeland Security said Thursday in a post on X.\n\nThat revelation prompted Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy to restate earlier concerns about who should be able to obtain commercial driver's licenses. Duffy and President Donald Trump have been pressing the issue and criticizing California ever since a deadly Florida crash in August was caused by an immigrant truck driver the federal government says was in the country illegally.\n\nThe Transportation Department significantly restricted when noncitizens can get commercial driver's licenses last month.\n\nDuffy said this week's crash wouldn't have happened if Newsom had followed these new rules.\n\n\"These people deserve justice. There will be consequences,\" he said in a statement.\n\nNewsom's office responded that the federal government approved Singh's federal employment authorization multiple times and this allowed him to obtain a commercial driver's license in accordance with federal law.\n\nCalifornia's Highway Patrol said in a release that traffic westbound on Interstate 10, about 26 miles (42 kilometers) west of San Bernardino, had slowed about 1 p.m. Tuesday when a tractor-trailer failed to stop, struck other vehicles and caused a chain-reaction crash.\n\nDashcam video from the tractor-trailer obtained by KABC-TV shows the truck slamming into what appears to be a small, white SUV in the freeway's center lane. It continued forward, plowing into several other vehicles, including another truck. It then crossed over two lanes before crashing into an already-disabled truck on the freeway's right shoulder.\n\nFlames can be seen erupting alongside the tractor-trailer as it crosses the two right lanes.\n\nCalifornia Highway Patrol Officer Rodrigo Jimenez says the agency has seen the KABC video and believes it is dashcam video from the truck that caused the crash.\n\n\"This tragedy follows a disturbing pattern of criminal illegal aliens driving commercial vehicles on American roads, directly threatening public safety,\" Homeland Security said Thursday in its X post.\n\nIn August, a truck driver made an illegal turn on Florida's Turnpike, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) north of West Palm Beach, and was struck by a minivan. Two passengers in the minivan died at the scene, and the driver died at a hospital.\n\nHomeland Security has said that truck driver, Harjinder Singh, was in the United States illegally. Florida authorities said he entered the U.S. illegally from Mexico in 2018.\n\nHomeland Security said Harjinder Singh obtained a commercial driver's license in California, which is one of 19 states, as well as the District of Columbia, that issue licenses regardless of immigration status, according to the National Immigration Law Center.\n\nThe Trump administration has pointed to the Florida crash while sparring with California's Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom.\n\nIn April, Trump issued an executive order saying truckers who don't read and speak the English language proficiently would be considered unfit for service.\n\n\"A driver who can't understand English will not drive a commercial vehicle in this country. Period,\" Duffy said the following month.\n\nUnder the new Transportation Department rules imposed last month, only noncitizen drivers who have three specific visas are allowed to qualify for commercial licenses. And states will be required to verify their immigration status. Only drivers who hold either an H-2a, H-2B or E-2 visa will qualify. H-2B is for temporary nonagricultural workers, while H-2a is for agricultural workers. E-2 is for people who make substantial investments in a U.S. business\n\nThe licenses will only be valid for up to one year unless the applicant's visa expires sooner than that.\n\nOn Thursday, Duffy called the California crash \"outrageous\" in a social media post.\n\n\"This is exactly why I set new restrictions that prohibit ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS from operating trucks,\" he wrote on X. \"@CAgovernor must join every other state in the U.S. in enforcing these new actions to prevent any more accidents and deaths.\"\n\nBhupinder Kaur, director of operations for UNITED SIKHS, said the New York-based humanitarian relief nonprofit, is alarmed by what it sees as growing bias involving immigrant drivers.\n\nIt was not immediately clear Thursday afternoon if Jashanpreet Singh is Sikh.\n\n\"Law enforcement and hasty social media posts constantly rush to name, photograph, and expose immigration status, while similar details about non-immigrant drivers remain withheld,\" Kaur told The Associated Press in an email Thursday. \"The discretion officials cite as 'privacy' elsewhere seems to vanish when the driver is an immigrant.\"\n\nImmigrant truckers make up nearly one in five long-haul drivers, Kaur continued, adding that most are fully licensed and law-abiding.\n\n\"Yet they face unequal scrutiny and coverage,\" Kaur said. \"Selective transparency distorts public understanding and can even influence legal outcomes.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Luis Andres Henao in Princeton, New Jersey, and Audrey McAvoy in Honolulu contributed.\n\n____\n\nThis story has been corrected to say that California is one of 19 states in as well as the District of Columbia, that issue standard driver's licenses regardless of immigration status, according to the National Immigration Law Center.",

        "description": "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy joins 'America Reports' to break down a fatal California crash, allegedly caused by an illegal immigrant, and how the suspect was able to obtain a driver's license.\n\nTransportation Secretary Sean Duffy accused California Gov. Gavin Newsom of violating new federal commercial licensing rules by purportedly allowing an immigrant in the country illegally to maintain a commercial driver's license (CDL).\n\nThat truck driver is accused of causing a freeway crash that resulted in three fatalities on Tuesday in California.\n\nNewsom is blaming the federal government for the crash, arguing its policies ultimately allowed the suspect to receive a license. Duffy rejected that claim.\n\nThe dispute comes as the transportation secretary threatens to withhold millions in federal highway funds from California and expands a federal review into how non-citizens acquire state-issued licenses.\n\nWHITE HOUSE SAYS CALIFORNIA GRANTED LICENSE TO ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT TRUCKER CHARGED IN FATAL DUI CRASH\n\n\"Had Gavin followed our rules per DOT, this guy would have never been on the road. Three more people would be alive,\" Duffy said Friday on \"America Reports.\"\n\nThe deadly crash occurred Tuesday on a Southern California freeway. Jashanpreet Singh, a 21-year-old Indian national, allegedly drove a semi-truck while under the influence, causing a multi-car pile-up with three fatalities.\n\nAccording to the Department of Transportation, California violated new federal rules by upgrading Singh's non-domiciled CDL despite an emergency rule and compliance notice issued Sept. 26.\n\n\"If California had complied with the Secretary's emergency rule and prevented the upgrade of this individual's driving privileges earlier this month, he would have never been able to get behind his big rig,\" according to a department statement.\n\nThe rule was designed to restrict eligibility for non-citizen licenses and require states to verify applicants' legal status.\n\nBLUE STATE INVESTIGATES HOW ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT TRUCKER GOT LICENSE BEFORE DEADLY FLORIDA CRASH\n\nCalifornia first issued Singh his CDL in June, but upgraded it in mid-October, weeks after the new federal restrictions took effect, according to the Department of Transportation.\n\nNewsom's press office called the crash \"tragic,\" but accused the Trump administration of trying to score \"political points.\"\n\n\"This is tragic, and as with every tragedy over the last ten months, Secretary Noem has ordered Secretary Duffy to look for every opportunity to manipulate the facts to score cheap political points,\" his office wrote on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nBLUE STATES DEFLECT BLAME IN TRUMP PROBE AFTER ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT TRUCKER CRASH KILLS 3 IN FLORIDA\n\n\"The FEDERAL government approved and renewed this individual's FEDERAL employment authorization multiple times - which allowed him to obtain a commercial driver's license in accordance with FEDERAL law.\"\n\n\"It's nice to see Gavin tap-dance in a tweet, good for him,\" he said.\n\n\"But the truth is, we do set the guidelines by which licenses can be issued. We sent that guidance out. Gavin Newsom said, 'I'm not going to follow it. I'm going to allow this foreigner to get an upgraded license.' That was Gavin Newsom's choice. The states issue commercial driver's licenses. We give the guidance, they issue them.\"\n\n\"California rules and regulations for Commercial Driver's Licensing are consistent with federal law,\" Newsom's office told Fox News Digital in part.\n\nThe California Transportation Agency posted on X: \"MISINFORMATION ALERT: The state does not determine commercial driver's license eligibility. The FEDERAL government approves and renews all FEDERAL employment authorization documents that allows individuals to work and obtain commercial driver's licenses.\"",

        "description": "The driver, 21-year-old Jashanpreet Singh, is in the U.S. illegally, DHS said.\n\nA semi-truck driver arrested in connection with an alleged DUI crash on a California highway that killed three people pleaded not guilty on Friday, amid scrutiny over the licensing of the 21-year-old suspect, who federal authorities say is in the United States illegally.\n\nProsecutors charge that the driver, identified by authorities as Jashanpreet Singh, was driving at a high rate of speed and under the influence of drugs when he rammed into stopped traffic, causing a chain-reaction crash on Interstate 10 in Ontario on Tuesday. Three people were killed and at least three others injured in the multi-vehicle crash, according to the criminal complaint.\n\nSingh pleaded not guilty to three counts of gross vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated and one count of driving under the influence of a drug causing injury during his initial court appearance in a Rancho Cucamonga court on Friday.\n\nHe was appointed a public defender and remains held without bail. His next court appearance has been scheduled for Nov. 4. A Punjabi interpreter will be required at his next hearing, according to court filings.\n\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement has lodged an arrest detainer for Singh, according to the Department of Homeland Security, which said he is in the U.S. illegally from India, entering through the southern border in 2022.\n\nHe was issued a commercial driver's license, or CDL, by California, according to the Department of Transportation, which said Singh is an asylum-seeker. On Friday, the agency said Singh should have been ineligible to keep his CDL days before the deadly crash under new emergency actions targeting noncitizens, including asylum-seekers.\n\nIn September, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced stricter eligibility requirements for noncitizens seeking CDLs. The new federal actions, which went into effect on Sept. 26, prevent all asylum-seekers from obtaining non-domiciled CDLs, according to the DOT.\n\nSingh was issued a restricted, non-domiciled CDL on June 27, according to the DOT. When he turned 21 on Oct. 15, the California Department of Motor Vehicles allegedly removed the restriction and upgraded Singh's license \"without applying the stricter standards\" as required by the emergency actions, the DOT said.\n\nAccording to the DOT, Singh should have instead returned to the DMV on or after Oct. 15 to upgrade his CDL, at which point he \"would have been subject to the emergency rule and found ineligible to retain the non-domiciled CDL due to Singh's status as an asylum seeker,\" the agency said.\n\n\"Gavin Newsom was explicitly warned California's CDL program was dangerously broken,\" the DOT said in a press release. \"The USDOT's emergency rule was issued to explicitly prevent drivers like Singh from getting behind the wheel of commercial motor vehicles.\"\n\nABC News has reached out to the California DMV and the California State Transportation Agency for comment but has not yet received a response.\n\nOn Thursday, California Gov. Gavin Newsom's office said the federal government approved and renewed Singh's federal employment authorization \"multiple times -- which allowed him to obtain a commercial driver's license in accordance with federal law.\"\n\n\"This is tragic, and as with every tragedy over the last ten months, Secretary Noem has ordered Secretary Duffy to look for every opportunity to manipulate the facts to score cheap political points,\" his office said in a statement.",

        "description": "Fox News national correspondent Bryan Llenas reports on the latest in the New Jersey gubernatorial race on 'Special Report.'\n\nThe U.S. Justice Department (DOJ) on Friday said it plans to send federal election watchers to California and New Jersey for their closely watched elections next month.\n\nNew Jersey, has an open seat for governor as Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat, prepares to leave office.\n\nCalifornia has a ballot measure aimed at redrawing the state's congressional map in favor of Democrats to counter states like Texas that has redrawn its map to help Republicans.\n\n\"Transparency at the polls translates into faith in the electoral process, and this Department of Justice is committed to upholding the highest standards of election integrity,\" U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement to The Associated Press.\n\nTRUMP'S SHADOW LOOMS LARGE OVER HEATED RACES ONE MONTH BEFORE ELECTION DAY\n\nFox News Digital has reached out to the DOJ for comment.\n\nBondi added that the goal of the election observers in Passaic County, New Jersey, as well as Los Angeles, Orange, Kern, Riverside and Fresno counties in California, is to \"ensure transparency, ballot security, and compliance with federal law.\"\n\nThe Republican parties in both states requested federal observers.\n\nDOJ TARGETS NONCITIZENS ON VOTER ROLLS AS PART OF TRUMP ELECTION INTEGRITY PUSH\n\n\"In recent elections, we have received reports of irregularities in these counties that we fear will undermine either the willingness of voters to participate in the election or their confidence in the announced results of the election,\" California GOP Chairwoman Corrin Rankin wrote in a letter to Harmeet Dhillon, who leads the DOJ's Civil Rights Division, on Monday.\n\nThe New Jersey GOP sent a similar letter about Passaic County, which is heavily Latino and once favored Democrats, but voted for President Donald Trump in 2024.\n\nThe state GOP alleged a \"long and sordid history\" of vote-by-mail fraud.\n\nFIVE RACES TO WATCH WITH 5 WEEKS TO GO UNTIL ELECTION DAY 2025\n\nDemocrats in both states have pushed back against the decision though.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom's office blasted it as an \"intimidation tactic.\"\n\n\"This is not a federal election,\" his office wrote on X. \"The US DOJ has no business or basis to interfere with this election.

        "title": "Jen Psaki: Trump keeps making himself the punchline",
        "description": "The White House Correspondents' Dinner is a Washington tradition in which the president and members of the press get together, have a few drinks and tell a few jokes at each other's expense. It's an annual event, but the 2011 dinner was especially notable.\n\nThat was the year that then-President Barack Obama got up and absolutely roasted Donald Trump -- and there's one joke from that night that has a certain resonance today. At the time, Trump was mulling a run for president. During his set, Obama said that, if elected, Trump \"certainly would bring some change to the White House.\"\n\nObama joked about an alternative universe in which Trump found his way into the White House and mused about what the real estate developer would do to the historic building, sharing a mocked-up picture showing it fitted out with golden columns and a neon sign bearing Trump's name.\n\nFast-forward 14 years, and we are, of course, now living in that alternate universe that Obama conjured up that night. By now, you have seen the images of Trump's construction crews tearing down the entire East Wing of the White House to make room for a gaudy new ballroom that the president plans to build in its place.\n\nNow, it can be frustrating, even infuriating, to watch Trump destroy a building that belongs to all of us, without approval from Congress or anyone else, just because he feels like it. But in doing so, the president is literally making himself the punch line of a 14-year-old joke -- a joke about what might happen if a narcissistic real estate developer with horrible taste became the president of the United States.\n\nTrump is proving once again that he remains a captive of the very stereotype that's made him a target of ridicule for so many years. He just can't seem to help himself. In that way, Trump himself is a joke, a walking, talking parody.\n\nThat's not to say his actions in office aren't dangerous -- they are -- but here's the thing: Authoritarian leaders can become so caught up in projecting their own power that their levels of blatant public corruption just get more laughable as they go.\n\nLet me give you an example. On Thursday, Trump pardoned Changpeng Zhao, the head of a cryptocurrency exchange, who was convicted of violating money laundering laws after he allowed criminals to use his platform to finance everything from child sex abuse to drug trafficking to terrorism. It was an outrageous move, made all the more outrageous by the fact that the company he founded has major business ties to the Trump family's own crypto venture.\n\nWhen Trump was asked about that pardon, he lashed out in his typical way. First, he said he had no idea what the reporter was talking about, even though the company Zhao founded has been campaigning for a pardon for a year. Then, Trump seemed to remember who Zhao was and told reporters that \"a lot of people say that he wasn't guilty of anything ... He served four months in jail and they say that he was not guilty of anything.\" This is equally ludicrous, because he pleaded guilty.\n\nLook, recognizing the absurdity of that doesn't minimize the danger of Trump -- it minimizes Trump himself, it exposes him for the small man he is, and it makes it easier to push back against his corruption.\n\nSo now, a number of Trump's opponents are showing that it isn't so hard to stand up to an insecure bully. Ever since he retook office, the president and his allies in Congress have been targeting special counsel Jack Smith, investigating him and trying to paint him as some kind of devious criminal.\n\nOn Thursday, Smith punched back: His attorneys sent a letter to Congress proclaiming that \"Mr. Smith respectfully requests the opportunity to testify in open hearings before the House and Senate Judiciary Committees.\"\n\nIn other words, Smith is telling Trump and his cronies that he wants to have this fight, and to have it in public. Smith is calling their bluff because he knows that what he can expose about Trump is far worse than anything they can do to him.\n\nWe're seeing that same kind of fight from Democratic elected officials who are making the bet that it pays to stand up to Trump, like California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker. Both have taken the fight directly to the president, showing very effective ways of dealing with a bully.\n\nOn Thursday, Trump backed off his threats to send National Guard troops into San Francisco after just one call with the city's Democratic mayor. And while it remains to be seen what will happen in the end, the president has already blinked, and he's shown that he will back down.\n\nDemocrats can clearly sense that, and in so many different ways, they now feel emboldened to go on offense.\n\nFor weeks, the White House has been lobbying Republican states to redraw their congressional maps and to give the president's party a big advantage in the midterms. Trump's tactics have succeeded in a few states, like Texas and North Carolina.\n\nBut Democrats in California are pushing back with Proposition 50, giving voters a chance to stand up to Trump by voting to redraw their state maps to counter what Republicans did in Texas. And after a relentless pressure campaign from Trump and Vice President JD Vance, Republicans in Indiana still don't have the votes to redraw maps there and steal more seats. Meanwhile, activists in Missouri are working to make sure voters have a chance to overrule any new maps in that state at the ballot box.\n\nOn Thursday, Democrats in Virginia announced that they are initiating a plan to redraw maps there, potentially netting Democrats three new seats in Congress. That makes the state's gubernatorial election in less than two weeks all the more important, but luckily for Democrats, Trump is hugely unpopular in that state. A new poll from Suffolk University found the president underwater by more than 12 points.\n\nSo yes, Trump is cruel and corrupt, he's knocking down the White House for a ballroom, and he's shaking down American taxpayers while pardoning a crypto CEO who has been a huge proponent of his own crypto business. That is all true. But he is also weak. He is unpopular. He's a joke.\n\nDemocrats know that -- and they know that it pays to stand up to him.",

        "title": "Exclusive | Katie Porter is a 'master manipulator' who would be no good as...",
        "description": "Katie Porter is a \"master manipulator\" who embodies everything wrong with politics today, according to her husband of 10 years.\n\nMatthew Hoffman, 50, told The Post the hot-headed liberal contender for California governor is a bad choice to run the deep blue state.\n\nReferring to video clips which exposed Porter's volatile temper and hostile treatment of staffers and journalists, he said: \"It's about time\" they came out.\n\n\"The amount of staff she goes through. The horrible things that she says [about others] ... those aren't fabrications,\" he warned The Post outside his home in Portland, Oregon.\n\nHoffman, who divorced Porter in 2013, said people are now starting to see who his ex-really is, and its people like her who make it \"hard to like politics,\" in recent times.\n\nPorter's campaign to replace term-limited Gavin Newsom has been hobbled by an on-air clash with CBS journalist Julie Watts. The former US representative accused the reporter of being \"unnecessarily argumentative\" when asked about what she'd do to win over Donald Trump supporters.\n\nHoffman said it was the most \"softball question\" to answer, and all she had to say was how the message should be to build bridges and for everyone to work together.\n\nAnother video emerged showing Porter yelling at a female staffer to \"get out of my f -- ing shot\" during a July 2021 Zoom call.\n\nHoffman -- who shares three children with his ex-wife, whom he had a bitter split from -- acknowledged Porter chafes with many in political circles, including Democratic Party bigwigs Nancy Pelosi and Adam Schiff.\n\n\"She can't even get along with Nancy Pelosi,\" Hoffman observed.\n\nHe also said it was preposterous for Porter to claim her California Senate primary loss to rival Rep. Schiff last March was because he wanted to \"rig\" the election.\n\nPorter suffered a crushing defeat, finishing a distant third behind Schiff and Republican Steve Garvey.\n\n\"The system's not rigged, Katie,\" warned Hoffman, saying it was all a matter of politics as usual.\n\nHowever, he was also quick to add his ex-wife is by no means dumb as \"she's a master manipulator.\"\n\nAfter the incident, Porter said she regretted her comment calling the election rigged.\n\nHoffman pointed out leadership is all about finding consensus but said Porter's personality means she isn't the type to listen to differing ideas and find an acceptable political middle ground.\n\n\"Katie and her ex-husband divorced more than a decade ago and have a positive and productive relationship as they continue to co-parent their three children,\" said Porter's campaign spokesperson Peter Opitz.\n\nAddressing their relationship, Hoffman described their divorce as \"awful.\"\n\nHoffman was the one to file for divorce, but shortly after Porter filed an emergency protective order and then a restraining order against him. Police also arrested Hoffman after a fight in which he broke a light switch in their home.\n\nHoffman responded with a request for a restraining order of his own, claiming Porter would \"routinely\" call him a \"f -- ing idiot\" and \"f -- ing incompetent\" and shattered a glass coffee pot in their kitchen counter in March 2012 when she felt their house wasn't clean enough.\n\n\"She would not let me have a cell phone because she said, 'You're too f -- ing dumb to operate it,'\" Hoffman said of his hot-headed ex in the documents.\n\nHoffman also claimed in divorce papers that in 2006, Porter exploded over the way he was making mashed potatoes, snapping, \"Can't you read the f -- ing instructions!\" before raising a \"ceramic bowl of steaming hot potatoes and dumped it on my head, burning my scalp,\" according to Hoffman's account in court papers.\n\nIn her first congressional run in 2018, Porter cast herself as a \"victim of domestic violence\" and frequently highlighted her role as a single mom.\n\n\"I'm the most boring person in America. I'm a mom of three kids, I protected my family, I ended a marriage that was troubled,\" Porter said.\n\nKatie \"loves to bang the drum\" of her being a single mom, Hoffman countered.\n\nThe couple eventually settled their divorce. Neither was ever charged with any wrongdoing by police and co-parenting arrangements were eventually settled.\n\nHoffman left California to become a Compliance specialist with the Oregon Employment Department.\n\nTheir three children -- two sons and a daughter, the youngest -- live with their mom.\n\nHoffman said he loves his kids and wants to be there for them as much as possible. While sees them on Facetime frequently, he would love to spend more time with them in person, although its hard with them being in Southern California.\n\nHe said he doesn't speak to Porter often and tries to avoid her, but when she does calls it's usually because she \"wants something,\" usually related to parenting.\n\nHoffman, originally from Oregon, said he's now moved on with his life and found someone new, but he still lives in the shadow of his painful divorce.\n\nPorter has been running her platform saying she offers the state \"a little bit of hope and a whole lot of grit,\" ahead of the Primary in June 2026.",

        "title": "Justice Department to send election monitors to California, New Jersey following requests from state GOPs",
        "description": "The Department of Justice is preparing to send federal election observers to California and New Jersey next month, targeting two Democratic states holding off-year elections following requests from state Republican parties.\n\nThe department announced Friday that it is planning to monitor polling sites in Passaic County, New Jersey, and five counties in southern and central California: Los Angeles, Orange, Kern, Riverside and Fresno. The goal, according to the DOJ, is \"to ensure transparency, ballot security, and compliance with federal law.\"\n\n\"Transparency at the polls translates into faith in the electoral process, and this Department of Justice is committed to upholding the highest standards of election integrity,\" Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement.\n\nElection monitoring is a routine function of the Justice Department, but the focus on California and New Jersey comes as both states are set to hold closely watched elections with national consequences on Nov. 4. New Jersey has an open seat for governor that has attracted major spending by both parties and California is holding a special election aimed at redrawing the state's congressional map to counter Republican gerrymandering efforts elsewhere ahead of the 2026 midterms.\n\nThe DOJ's efforts are also the latest salvo in the GOP's preoccupation with election integrity after President Trump spent years refusing to accept the results of the 2020 election and falsely railing against mail-in voting as rife with fraud. Democrats fear the new administration will attempt to gain an upper hand in next year's midterms with similarly unfounded allegations of fraud.\n\nThe announcement comes days after the Republican parties in both states wrote letters to the Justice Department requesting their assistance. Some leading Democrats in the states blasted the decision.\n\nNew Jersey Attorney General Matt Platkin called the move \"highly inappropriate\" and said the department \"has not even attempted to identify a legitimate basis for its actions.\"\n\nRusty Hicks, chair of the California Democratic Party, said in a statement that \"No amount of election interference by the California Republican Party is going to silence the voices of California voters.\"\n\nThe letter from the California GOP, sent Monday and obtained by the Associated Press, asked Harmeet Dhillon, who leads the DOJ's Civil Rights Division, to provide monitors to observe the election in the five counties.\n\n\"In recent elections, we have received reports of irregularities in these counties that we fear will undermine either the willingness of voters to participate in the election or their confidence in the announced results of the election,\" wrote GOP Chairwoman Corrin Rankin.\n\nThe state is set to vote Nov. 4 on a redistricting proposition that would dramatically redraw California's congressional lines to add as many as five additional Democratic seats to its U.S. House delegation.\n\nEach of the counties named, they alleged, has experienced recent voting issues, such as sending incorrect or duplicate ballots to voters. They also take issue with how Los Angeles and Orange counties maintain their voter rolls.\n\nCalifornia is one of at least eight states the Justice Department has sued as part of a wide-ranging request for detailed voter roll information involving at least half the states. The department has not said why it wants the data.\n\nElection integrity efforts were a focus of Dhillon's California law practice before she joined the Justice Department. Her practice sued over the state's election laws in the past, including a 2020 lawsuit on behalf of the California Republican Party challenging ballot collection efforts amid the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nBrandon Richards, a spokesman for Gov. Gavin Newsom, said the DOJ has no standing to \"interfere\" with California's election because the ballot contains only a state-specific initiative and has no federal races.\n\n\"Deploying these federal forces appears to be an intimidation tactic meant for one thing: suppress the vote,\" he said in an email.\n\nOrange County Registrar of Voters Bob Page said he welcomes anyone who wants to watch the county's election operations and said it's common to have local, state, federal and even international observers. He described Orange County's elections as \"accessible, accurate, fair, secure, and transparent.\"\n\nLos Angeles County Clerk Dean Logan said election observers are standard practice across the country and that the county, with 5.8 million registered voters, is continuously updating and verifying its voter records.\n\n\"Voters can have confidence their ballot is handled securely and counted accurately,\" he said.\n\nMost Californians vote using mail ballots returned through the postal service, drop boxes or at local voting centers, which typically leaves polling places relatively quiet on Election Day. But in pursuit of accuracy and counting every vote, the nation's most populous state has gained a reputation for tallies that can drag on for weeks -- and sometimes longer.\n\nIn 2024, it took until early December to declare Democrat Adam Gray the winner in his Central Valley district, the final congressional race to be decided in the nation last year.\n\nCalifornia's request echoed a similar letter sent by New Jersey Republicans asking the DOJ to dispatch election monitors to \"oversee the receipt and processing of vote-by-mail ballots\" and \"monitor access to the Board of Elections around the clock\" in suburban Passaic County ahead of the state's governor's race.\n\nThe New Jersey Republican State Committee told Dhillon that federal intervention was necessary to ensure an accurate vote count in the heavily Latino county that was once a Democratic stronghold, but shifted to Mr. Trump's column in last year's presidential race.\n\nThe county could be critical to GOP gubernatorial nominee Jack Ciattarelli's hopes against Democrat Mikie Sherrill. But the letter cited previous voter fraud cases in the county and alleged a \"long and sordid history\" of vote-by-mail shenanigans.\n\nIn 2020, a judge ordered a new election for a city council seat in Paterson -- the largest city in Passaic County -- after the apparent winner and others were charged with voter fraud.\n\nPlatkin said the state is committed to ensuring its elections are fair and secure. With the DOJ's announcement, he said the attorney general's office is \"considering all of our options to prevent any effort to intimidate voters or interfere with our elections.\"\n\nLocal election offices and polling places around the country already have observers from both political parties to ensure rules are followed. The DOJ also has a long history of sending observers to jurisdictions that have histories of voting rights violations to ensure compliance with federal civil rights laws.\n\nLast year, when the Biden administration was still in power, some Republican-led states said they would not allow federal monitors to access voting locations on Election Day.\n\nMr. Trump has for years railed against mail voting as part of his repeated false claims that former President Joe Biden's victory in 2020 was rigged. He alleges it is riddled with fraud, even though numerous studies have found no evidence of widespread fraud in U.S. elections.\n\nEarlier this year, Mr. Trump pledged to ban vote-by-mail across the country, something he has no power to do under the U.S. Constitution.\n\nThe DOJ's effort will be overseen by Dhillon's Civil Rights Division, which will deploy personnel in coordination with U.S. attorney's offices and work closely with state and local officials, the department said. The department is also soliciting further requests for monitoring in other jurisdictions.\n\nDavid Becker, a CBS News election law expert and political contributor who has served as an election monitor and trained them, said the work is typically done by department lawyers who are prohibited from interfering at polling places.\n\nBut Becker, the executive director of the Center for Election Integrity & Research, said local jurisdictions normally agree to the monitors' presence.\n\nIf the administration tried to send monitors without a clear legal rationale to a place where local officials didn't want them, \"That could result in chaos,\" he said.",

        "description": "Governor Gavin Newsom said President Donald Trump sending federal troops to San Francisco is part of the \"authoritarian playbook.\"\n\n* Two people were wounded after Coast Guard personnel shot at a U-Haul truck outside a base in Alameda, California.\n\n* The incident occurred hours after a protest against a potential federal immigration crackdown at the same location.\n\n* The FBI is investigating after the driver allegedly refused orders to stop and attempted to ram the main gate.\n\n* A protester at the scene described the U-Haul driver as an \"independent actor\" not involved with the demonstration.\n\nOAKLAND, CA \u2012 Two people were wounded following a late-night shooting outside a U.S. Coast Guard base where protesters were rallying against a deferred federal immigration crackdown in the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\nThe FBI is investigating the incident, which occurred around 10 p.m. on Oct. 23 after Coast Guard security personnel opened fire on a U-Haul truck that refused multiple orders to stop. The truck attempted to ram the main gate at Coast Guard Island in Alameda, California, said Lt. Krystal Wolfe, a Coast Guard spokesperson.\n\n\"The driver failed to comply and proceeded to put the vehicle in reverse \u2012 suddenly accelerating backwards at a high rate of speed directly toward them,\" Wolfe said in an emailed statement. \"When the vehicle's actions posed a direct threat to the safety of Coast Guard and security personnel, law enforcement officers discharged several rounds of defensive live fire.\"\n\nThe U-Haul driver was wounded in the stomach and is being held in custody for a mental health evaluation, Wolfe said. A second shooting victim, a bystander, was struck by a fragment, taken to a local hospital, and later released, Wolfe said.\n\nThe Oct. 23 shooting occurred several hours after hundreds of protesters marched in front of the entrance to Coast Guard Island, an artificial island between Oakland and Alameda that houses several major Coast Guard commands.\n\nCustoms and Border Protection agents were staging on the island in preparation for a federal immigration crackdown ordered by the Trump adminstration, but then put on hold at the last minute.\n\nDuring the protest, at least two demonstrators were taken into custody by the California Highway Patrol for obstruction, after repeatedly being told to clear the Coast Guard Island entrance to allow vehicles to leave the island.\n\nThose arrests came hours after President Donald Trump paused the deployment of federal agents to San Francisco, citing a call with the city's mayor, Daniel Lurie \u2012 but before the public was told of the change in plans.\n\nThe president has sent troops into a handful of Democratic-led cities across the country since June, including Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., Chicago, Portland, Oregon, and Memphis, Tennessee.\n\nProtester calls U-Haul driver shot an 'independent actor'\n\nKris Ness, who said he'd been at the Oct. 23 immigration protest throughout the day, described the U-Haul driver shot by the Coast Guard to KTVU-TV as an \"independent actor\" who wasn't involved with the protest.\n\nNess said the driver showed up to the scene around 9:30 p.m., broke through a barrier, and \"reversed toward the Coast Guard.\"\n\nNess also told the TV station he saw the Coast Guard fire up to 50 rounds, and said that an \"innocent bystander was struck.\" Ness said he ran over to help the shooting victim before he was taken to the hospital.\n\n\"He was definitely bleeding, though,\" Ness said.\n\nNess said the driver attempted to get away but was eventually arrested.\n\nNess said that the group of protesters he was with told the Coast Guard that they were peaceful and not connected with the driver, as the Oakland police and Alameda County sheriff's deputies arrived to secure the scene.\n\n\"In fact, we tried to stop them,\" Ness told the TV station. \"It's a really terrible picture for the rest of us, especially. You know, aside from the fact that he was a completely independent actor, he refused to talk to us as well. It was all around just really weird and dangerous and unfortunate.\"",

        "description": "Jennifer Earl is the Vice President of Growth & Engagement at CBS News and Stations. Jennifer has previously written for outlets including The Daily Herald, The Gazette, NBC News, Newsday, Fox News and more.\n\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom called President Trump's plan to send National Guard troops to San Francisco \"laughable,\" suggesting the president had to reverse course for \"obvious reasons\" because \"there's nothing happening\" in the city.\n\n\"He couldn't even make up a pretense for this,\" Newsom told Robert Costa in an interview airing on \"CBS Sunday Morning\" this weekend. He cast the city as an urban area that is confronting crime and not ignoring the issue. He highlighted that San Francisco is on track to achieve a 70-year low homicide rate and there's been an overall decline in violent crimes year over year, according to the Major Cities Chiefs Association.\n\nNewsom vowed to swiftly block any future attempts to send in military forces to the city.\n\n\"Lawsuit's ready to go,\" said Newsom, adding that the \"second he does it, we'll be in court.\" Newsom noted the state has already filed 43 lawsuits against the Trump administration in the nearly 40 weeks since he returned to office.\n\nMr. Trump said Thursday that he called off his plan to deploy federal agents to the city after speaking with local tech leaders and Mayor Daniel Lurie, who he says asked for \"a chance to see if he can turn it around.\" Lurie said in a separate statement that he reiterated to Mr. Trump that San Francisco \"is on the rise,\" and the president agreed to call off the plans.\n\nNewsom also touted the city being the global tech capital and said business is booming.\n\n\"I mean, we're the center of the universe in terms of artificial intelligence. Quite literally the center of the universe in startups and innovation, entrepreneurial. This city's coming back in a big, big way,\" Newsom said.\n\nDuring the interview, Newsom also discussed such topics as California's redistricting proposal, which is coming up before voters Nov. 4; Newsom's social media mocking of the president, and the Democratic Party's response to Mr. Trump; and what he calls Mr. Trump's threat of an \"imperial presidency.\" He also discussed his political future and whether he would consider a 2028 presidential bid.",

        "title": "Jen Psaki Says Trump's Gaudy White House Ballroom Shows His 'Horrible Taste': 'A Walking, Talking Parody of Himself' | Video",
        "description": "\"Trump is literally making himself the punchline of a 14-year-old joke,\" the MSNBC host notes of his East Wing demolition\n\nJen Psaki said President Donald Trump's $300 million White House ballroom makeover proves not only that he has horrible taste, but also that he's the \"walking, talking parody of himself\" that Barack Obama joked about 14 years ago.\n\n\"I want to take you back to the 2011 White House Correspondents' Dinner. Yes, that one. You know, the Correspondents' Dinner -- it's the annual Washington tradition, kind of a weird one where the president and members of the press get together, maybe have a few drinks,\" Psaki said on Thursday night's episode of \"The Briefing.\" \"They tell a few jokes at each other's expense. But in 2011, the dinner was especially notable because that was the year that Barack Obama got up and absolutely roasted Donald Trump. And there was one joke from that night that I think has a certain resonance today.\"\n\nPsaki then played a clip of Obama from the dinner where he said, \"Say what you will about Mr. Trump. He certainly would bring some change to the White House.\" The former president then showed a mockup of the White House made to look like one of Trump's casinos. In the clip, the entire room erupts in laughter -- well, everyone except Trump.\n\n\"He does not look thrilled,\" the MSNBC host noted. \"But that was then-President Barack Obama imagining what felt at the time like a completely crazy, bananas universe -- an alternate one where Trump becomes president and renovates the White House to look like one of his tacky hotels and casinos.\"\n\nShe continued: \"But now, of course, we are living in that crazy, wacky alternate universe that Obama conjured up that night a long time ago. By now, you've seen the images of Donald Trump's construction crews tearing down the entire East Wing of the White House to make room for a gaudy new ballroom Trump plans to build in its place.\"\n\nThis week, the Trump administration demolished the East Wing of the White House with plans to build a $300 million dollar ballroom in its place. The move has sparked backlash from the public and many Democratic politicians because Trump did not seek approval from Congress or the NCPC (National Capital Planning Commission). Psaki empathized with the frustration many are feeling, but also pointed out that Trump has unwittingly made Obama's joke about him all those years ago true.\n\n\"Trump is literally making himself the punchline of a 14-year-old joke. A joke about what might happen if a narcissistic real estate developer with horrible taste became the president of the United States. He's proving once again that he remains kind of a captive of the very stereotype that's made him a target of ridicule like that for so many years. He just can't seem to help himself.\"\n\nPsaki went on to call Trump \"a walking, talking parody of himself.\" She noted that this doesn't minimize the dangerous decisions he's made while in office, but did point out that \"authoritarian leaders can become so caught up in projecting their own power that their levels of blatant public corruption just get more laughable as they go.\"\n\nShe also said his actions expose the president for the \"small man that he is,\" as California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker took new actions against Trump's ICE deployment and attempts to redraw congressional maps.\n\n\"He is cruel and he is very corrupt. He's knocking down the White House for a ballroom, shaking down American taxpayers and pardoning a crypto CEO who has been a huge proponent of his own crypto business,\" Psaki concluded. \"All of that is true. All of that is insane. But he is weak. He's not strong. And he is growing more and more unpopular. He's become a version of his own joke -- a joke about himself. And Democrats know it.\"",

        "description": "GRAPHIC CONTENT WARNING: Federal authorities say the driver of a California big rig should never have been behind the wheel at the time he allegedly caused a crash that killed three people, caught on harrowing dashcam video.\n\nDashcam video from a deadly California freeway crash involving a suspected illegal immigrant truck driver in a tractor-trailer shows the vehicle plowing through bumper-to-bumper traffic in a wreck that killed three.\n\nJashanpreet Singh, 21, received a California commercial driver's license in June, according to the federal Department of Transportation.\n\nThe video shows the truck he is accused of driving rear-ending a row of cars caught in traffic before flames burst out from under the hood and it veers to the right, crashing into more vehicles and what appear to be utility trucks before coming to a stop near the shoulder.\n\nEXPERT REVEALS HOW ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT TRUCKER MAY HAVE GOTTEN COMMERCIAL LICENSE BEFORE FATAL FLORIDA CRASH\n\nIn September, federal officials warned California that they uncovered compliance issues with such licenses and demanded corrections, including pausing the issuance of new licenses to non-citizens and reviewing existing licenses to make sure they followed the rules.\n\nThose that didn't meet the criteria were supposed to be revoked. However, on Oct. 15, Singh turned 21 and actually had a restriction on his license removed, according to the DOT.\n\nHowever, under an emergency DOT policy, he should have been disqualified, authorities said.\n\nSix days later, authorities say Singh was driving a semi-truck while allegedly under the influence of drugs when he plowed into a row of stopped cars on the freeway, killing three people.\n\n\"My prayers are with the families of the victims of this tragedy,\" U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a statement Thursday night.\n\nILLEGAL IMMIGRANT TRUCK DRIVER ACCUSED IN DEADLY FLORIDA CRASH GOT BIDEN WORK PERMIT AFTER TRUMP DENIAL: DHS\n\n\"It would have never happened if Gavin Newsom had followed our new rules,\" he continued. \"California broke the law and now three people are dead and two are hospitalized. These people deserve justice. There will be consequences.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Newsom's office did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.\n\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement filed a detainer request for Singh on Oct. 22. He remains jailed in San Bernardino County.\n\n\"It is a terrible tragedy three innocent people lost their lives due to the reckless open border policies that allowed an illegal alien to be released into the U.S. and drive an 18-wheeler on America's highways,\" Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement. \"This accident follows a disturbing trend of illegal aliens driving 18 wheelers and semi-trucks on America's roads. Earlier this week, DHS highlighted another fatal accident in Indiana caused by an illegal alien driving a semi-truck. Under President Trump and Secretary Noem, ICE is working day-in and day-out to make America's roads safe again.\"",

        "description": "ALAMEDA, Calif. (AP) -- Law enforcement officers fired shots at a vehicle that backed into a U.S. Coast Guard base in the San Francisco Bay Area that had earlier been the site of protests against federal immigration agents, and hours after President Donald Trump called off a planned surge of federal agents into San Francisco to quell crime.\n\nThe shots were fired about 10 p.m. Thursday at the base in Alameda, the Coast Guard posted on X. The vehicle drove away and no Coast Guard personnel were hurt, the statement said.\n\nVideo from the scene showed what appeared to be a U-Haul truck trying to back into the base.\n\n\"Coast Guard personnel issued multiple verbal commands to stop the vehicle, the driver failed to comply and proceeded to put the vehicle in reverse,\" the statement said. \"When the vehicle's actions posed a direct threat to the safety of Coast Guard and security personnel, law enforcement officers discharged several rounds of live fire.\"\n\nThe Coast Guard said the FBI was investigating. The FBI and U-Haul did not immediately respond to emails seeking further information.\n\nEarlier Thursday, protesters had assembled at the island, with many singing hymns and carrying signs saying, \"Protect our neighbors\" and \"No ICE or troops in the Bay,\" a reference to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the National Guard.\n\nTrump had been threatening to send the National Guard to San Francisco, a move Mayor Daniel Lurie and Gov. Gavin Newsom said was unnecessary because crime is on the decline. Separately, U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents began arriving at the Coast Guard base in the region earlier Thursday for a possible ramp up of immigration enforcement, a move that drew several hundred protesters.\n\nTrump said he backed off after speaking to the mayor and several prominent business leaders who said they're working hard to clean up the city.\n\nThat decision was in contrast to others made by Trump to send the military into Democratic-run cities over fierce resistance from mayors and governors.\n\nThe deployment of National Guard troops on the streets of Washington faced challenges in two courts on Friday -- one in the nation's capital and another in West Virginia -- while across the country a judge in Portland, Oregon, was considering whether to let Trump deploy troops there. Deployment remains blocked in the Chicago area.\n\nCoast Guard Island is a 67-acre human-made island formed in 1913 in the Oakland Estuary between Oakland and Alameda. It is federally owned, does not allow visits from the general public without an escort or specific government identification, and it has been home to the current base, Base Alameda, since 2012, according to a Coast Guard document from 2016.\n\nBase Alameda provides a variety of services for Coast Guard activities throughout the West Coast.",

She said that both were stable and were transported to the nearest hospital to undergo non-life-threatening surgery.\n\nICE OFFICERS IN ILLINOIS TARGETED BY ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS WHO USED 'VEHICLES AS WEAPONS,' OFFICIALS SAY\n\nLos Angeles local outlet ABC 7 reported that Parias is a well-known TikTok influencer who regularly follows ICE agents and goes by the moniker \"Richard LA.\" The outlet also reported that crowds gathered outside the hospital to protest the arrest as well as ICE.\n\nAccording to McLaughlin, officers had previously encountered Parias, but he had escaped arrest. She said that he entered the country illegally at an unknown date and location and that he has a history of driving without a license, failing to prove financial responsibility, vehicle code violations, and resisting arrest.\n\nNow, DHS is pursuing criminal charges against Parias for assaulting, resisting, or impeding federal law enforcement.\n\nMcLaughlin said that \"these are the consequences of conduct and rhetoric by sanctuary politicians and activists who urge illegal aliens to resist arrest.\"\n\n\"We are once again calling on sanctuary politicians, agitators, and the media to turn the temperature down and stop calling for violence and resistance against ICE law enforcement,\" said McLaughlin.\n\nShe called out several Democrats who she said have held webinars to provide \"resources and tips for how to openly defy ICE.\" McLaughlin said that Democrats who have emboldened illegals to attempt to evade ICE include Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass and California Governor Gavin Newsom.\n\nTRUMP REVEALS HOW US MILITARY IS GOING TO CRACK DOWN ON DRUG SMUGGLERS ON LAND\n\nIn response, a spokesperson for Newsom told Fox News Digital that \"President Trump and [White House Homeland Security Advisor] Stephen Miller are trying to orchestrate the largest deportation effort in history, disregarding due process and even the safety of U.S. citizens and law enforcement.\"\n\n\"These aggressive arrests are a PR campaign, using fear and force. They want to manufacture chaos, then blame others,\" the spokesperson said, adding, \"Trump is forcing the federal government to indiscriminately arrest U.S. citizens through racial profiling, vehicle ramming, and forced entry, then broadcasting these interactions online.\"\n\nThe spokesperson flipped the script on the Trump administration, saying, \"The federal government is unnecessarily endangering our law enforcement officers, who, even in this chaos, are trying to do their jobs lawfully and serve their communities. They are creating fear among hardworking families - our neighbors, colleagues, and friends - who now have a target on their backs because of this administration.\"\n\n\"Immigration law can be enforced without a message of terror,\" the Newsom spokesperson said.\n\nFox News Digital also reached out to the offices of Ocasio-Cortez and Bass but did not immediately receive a response.\n\nWATCH: SCATHING REPORT EXPOSES WHAT NEW YORKERS THINK OF SANCTUARY POLICIES AS MAMDANI VICTORY LOOMS\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson also weighed in, telling Fox News Digital that \"ICE Officers are facing a 1000% increase in assaults because of unhinged rhetoric from activists and Democrat politicians smearing heroic ICE officers.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"Anyone who assaults or otherwise harms law enforcement officers will be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law,\" said Jackson, adding, \"Democrats must stop siding with illegal aliens over American law enforcement.\"",

        "title": "Renovations at the White House Aren't Unusual. But Trump's Makeover Is.",
        "description": "Presidents have always tailored the White House to their needs, but with the demolition of the East Wing, a $300 million ballroom and other changes, President Trump isn't wasting any time making it into his own project.\n\nPresident Trump is far from the first president to put his mark on the White House, a building that has been changing almost since the day it opened in 1800.\n\nThomas Jefferson added a wine cellar, and James Monroe and Andrew Jackson put on porticos. Theodore Roosevelt erected the West Wing; Richard Nixon added a bowling alley; and Barack Obama adapted a tennis court to create a place to play hoops. Franklin D. Roosevelt put in a pool.\n\nYet for all of that, the images this week of the East Wing's tear-down have still been jarring, as Mr. Trump began construction on a $300 million ballroom that he promised would be big, beautiful and \"privately funded by many generous Patriots.\"\n\n\"Every President has dreamt about having a Ballroom at the White House to accommodate people for grand parties, State Visits, etc.,\" the president posted on Truth Social on Monday, adding, \"This Ballroom will be happily used for Generations to come!\"\n\nMr. Trump's second-term overhaul of the White House already ranks among its most extensive, as the president has forcefully exerted his executive -- and aesthetic -- privilege on the Oval Office, the Rose Garden and other spaces.\n\nExperts place the makeover beyond anything since the Kennedys' Camelot era -- when the Rose Garden, now covered in stone slabs, was renewed -- or even further back, to Harry S. Truman's tenure, when he basically saved the White House from collapsing in on itself.\n\nBut no one has seemingly been more determined to put his stamp on \"The People's House,\" as it's known, said Kate Andersen Brower, a journalist and the author of \"The Residence: Inside the Private World of the White House.\"\n\n\"Nobody has tried to reshape the White House into their happy place like what he's doing,\" she said.\n\nThe White House has defended the changes as part of a long tradition of presidential upgrades. But the demolition work has also led to the awkward optics of the president tearing down a singular symbol of American democracy, something that has inspired a furious outcry, including from some who lived there in the past.\n\n\"It's not his house. It's your house,\" wrote Hillary Clinton on X. \"And he's destroying it.\"\n\nExperts on the White House say the president's pad has, in fact, long needed more room for large events, including James A. Abbott, an author of \"Designing Camelot: The Kennedy White House Restoration and Its Legacy,\" who said a large state dining room had been \"needed for 60 years.\"\n\n\"The White House has to evolve for the needs of the office,\" Mr. Abbott said, noting that other presidential administrations had groused that the White House's capacity for state dinners was limited by space. The Obamas, for instance, used tents for some occasions, and the Kennedys divided guests up into separate rooms.\n\nAnd while Mr. Abbott said he did not agree with the Trumps' politics, or the planned location of the new ballroom, he defended the right to build it.\n\n\"Do not blame the Trumps,\" he said. \"What they're trying to do is make sure the accommodations fulfill the need.\"\n\nMr. Trump has offered practical justifications for some other changes to the premises, saying, for instance, that one of his reasons for placing slabs over the Rose Garden was that the grass footing was difficult to navigate for women in heels.\n\nStill, reviews of the ballroom's plans, and its splashy interior, have been decidedly mixed.\n\n\"It looks like the Bellagio without the craps tables,\" said Robert Klara, the author of \"The Hidden White House: Harry Truman and the Reconstruction of America's Most Famous Residence.\"\n\nArchitectural historians have expressed \"grave concern\" about the project, while others have noted that the construction does not have the approval of the National Capital Planning Commission, which oversees government buildings in Washington. On Tuesday, the National Trust for Historic Preservation urged a pause for the \"legally required public review process.\"\n\nThe demolition also seemingly contradicts the president's own pledge that it would not \"interfere with the current building.\"\n\nAnd with the government still shut down and many people still struggling, the ballroom construction has also been sharply criticized in economic terms.\n\n\"Oh you're trying to say the cost of living is skyrocketing?\" Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, wrote on X. \"Donald Trump can't hear you over the sound of bulldozers demolishing a wing of the White House.\"\n\nNone of which seems to bother a president who continues to challenge institutional norms, a position amplified by his backers.\n\n\"Losers who are quick to criticize need to stop their pearl clutching and understand the building needs to be modernized,\" said Steven Cheung, the White House communications director, in a post on X. \"Otherwise you're just living in the past.\"\n\nMr. Trump is not the only president who has been criticized for extravagance or the cost of upgrades. According to the White House Historical Association, Mr. Jefferson -- ever the sophisticate -- took some heat for adding pricey colonnades; Andrew Jackson's addition of the North Portico, around 1829-30, was also viewed as problematic because of the economic downturn at the time. Even the East Wing -- built out during Franklin D. Roosevelt's presidency and now being gutted -- was questioned because of its construction during wartime belt-tightening.\n\nExperts in psychology and design say Mr. Trump's motivations may lie in a mix of political and personal preferences, like his obsession with gold, including branding his administration \"a new Golden age.\"\n\nGlittering surroundings imply wealth, of course, and wealth implies power, social standing and sophistication. Rebecca Zorach, an art historian and co-author of \"Gold: Nature and Culture,\" noted that rulers had long used grandiose projects like Versailles to express \"ephemeral displays\" of political, spiritual and religious power.\n\nMr. Trump's ample use of gilt might also have a strategic motive, said Sally Augustin, a psychologist who has studied the mental impact of design. \"People are meant to be hyper-stimulated in that environment, which sort of puts them on their back foot,\" she said.\n\nThe ballroom renovation has raised sinister speculation from some Democrats as well. \"Who spends $200 million on a ballroom at their home and then leaves?\" said Gov. Gavin Newsom of California, at a Politico event in late August.\n\nThe makeovers are not completely surprising considering the president's background: a real estate mogul who has always loved a big project, building golf courses, hotels and skyscrapers all affixed with his name, though he has also had a series of projects fail and flop.\n\n\"I'm going to be building,\" Mr. Trump recalled saying to an associate in \"Art of the Deal,\" his 1987 memoir, \"when everyone else has gone bust.\"\n\nEven before construction began, Mr. Trump seemed excited by his latest project, spotted on the roof surveying the site.\n\n\"Nobody previously had any knowledge or experience in doing such things,\" the president wrote in June, of building. \"But I do.\"\n\nThe White House, however, is a different type of project, already built and in no need of branding, a symbol of both government and an actual museum, as well as a residence whose tenants are -- by dint of democracy and term limits -- always just passing through.\n\nMs. Brower said Mr. Trump's efforts had far outstripped those of his predecessors, noting, for instance, that while Ronald Reagan \"had a lot of western paraphernalia -- horse saddles and things like that.\" But, \"he wasn't trying to recreate the White House into a horse ranch like his ranch in California,\" she said. \"Kennedy wasn't trying to make it like Hyannis Port or Palm Beach.\"\n\nNot so for Mr. Trump, whose embrace of the South Florida sensibility extended into using striped yellow-and-white beach umbrellas -- like those at Mar-a-Lago -- on the Rose Garden, which he is calling the Rose Garden Club.\n\nKrystine I. Batcho, a professor of psychology at Le Moyne College in Syracuse who has written about the importance of home in human psychology, said renovations often came from the same place as big political and policy decisions: the urge to leave a legacy, particularly for people whose self-esteem is \"wrapped up in their success in the world.\"\n\nShe added: \"Their need is greater to put their mark, in external ways, both in their public life and their personal lives.\"\n\nMr. Klara, a critic of the ballroom's design, said that with other presidential changes, there was not a sense that \"they wanted people to look at those additions and think of them.\"\n\nMr. Trump's changes, though, seemed different.\n\n\"There's a self-aggrandizement to the scale that, to me, seems more about the builder than the building,\" he said.",

        "description": "Recipients of the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program could see their benefits dry up starting next Saturday, Nov. 1 if the government shutdown continues, according to reports and authorities.\n\nSNAP, which serves nearly 42 million Americans every month, was able to keep funds running through October because states received funding before the government shutdown on Oct. 1.\n\nBut, in an Oct. 10 letter to state and regional SNAP directors, the US Department of Agriculture warned there wouldn't be enough funding to cover full benefits in November if the stalemate persists, NBC News reported.\n\nSome states have already announced plans to suspend SNAP payments next month, a move that could dramatically disrupt food access across the country.\n\nThe program, which allocates funds to states on a monthly basis, has not gone dark during any other government shutdown in modern history.\n\nSome state officials are urging recipients of SNAP, otherwise known as food stamps, to hoard shelf-stable goods and rely on food banks for additional support.\n\n\"If you have accrued SNAP benefits from previous months on your account, use those funds now to buy shelf-stable foods that can last through November and beyond,\" the Arkansas Department of Human Services states on its website.\n\nFood banks have blasted the proposed protocol, saying they do not have enough resources or chow to fill the gaps.\n\n\"There's no way that our charitable food network or the system in this country can provide that much food overnight or quickly. It's an impossible task,\" Catherine D'Amato, CEO of the Greater Boston Food Bank, told the outlet.\n\nD'Amato estimated a potential loss of 56 million meals in Massachusetts next month if funds run dry.\n\nPennsylvania has already halted benefits, issuing a notice that \"starting October 16, SNAP benefits will not be paid until the federal government shutdown ends and funds are released to PA.\"\n\n\"Please be patient and respectful to our staff while we try to assist you through these changes caused by the federal government shutdown,\" the statement read.\n\nTexas said payments will stop if the closure lingers past Oct. 27, while Wisconsin warned recipients that leftover October funds \"may not be available in November,\" the outlet reported.\n\n\"Benefits may not be available in November,\" read a letter to Wisconsin residents. \"This may include any funds remaining on your card at the end of October. You may want to use your benefits to stock up on food before the end of October.\"\n\nOregon and Massachusetts state treasurers said their states have no contingency plans for SNAP if the federal government can't provide necessary funding in a press call on Thursday, according to the outlet.\n\nOther states have announced scarcely fleshed-out plans for when SNAP benefits run out.\n\nRepublican Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin said he would declare a state of emergency to provide food benefits to SNAP beneficiaries. The details of how the benefits would be rolled out have not been made clear.\n\nLouisiana Gov. Jeff Landry, another Republican, also vaguely vowed to make it a top priority to make sure \"seniors, individuals with disabilities, and children who rely on food stamps do not go hungry in Louisiana.\"\n\nNew Hampshire officials announced a plan to increase access to food through food banks and mobile pantries, requiring approval of a legislative committee in the GOP-controlled state.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, said this week that he would deploy the National Guard to help food banks.\n\n\"This is serious, this is urgent - and requires immediate action,\" Newsom said in a statement.\n\nLower-income families who qualify for SNAP receive debit cards loaded each month by the federal government to load up on groceries at participating stores.\n\nThe average monthly benefit is $187 per person.\n\nMost beneficiaries have incomes at or below the poverty level.\n\nWIC, which provides food for low-income women and children, is also at risk of running dry by the end of October despite a $300 million infusion earlier this month.\n\n\"Continue to hold out for healthcare for illegals or reopen the government so mothers, babies, and the most vulnerable among us can receive timely WIC and SNAP allotments,\" a spokesperson for the USDA told the outlet, framing the issue as a political showdown caused by Democrats.\n\nThe USDA did not immediately respond to The Post's request for comment.",

        "title": "CalFresh payments will be paused in November amid ongoing government shutdown",
        "description": "With the federal government still shut down, CalFresh recipients will now officially see their November benefits delayed, according to the California Department of Social Services.\n\nThe deadline for the government to reopen before federal food programs like SNAP would see their funding dry up was Thursday, October 23.\n\nThe disruption will impact the more than 5.5 million Californians who rely on CalFresh benefits to be loaded onto their EBT cards each month. More than 60% of those enrolled are seniors and children.\n\n\"It's not only challenging, it's a bit of a crisis,\" said Caitlyn Sly, CEO of the Food Bank of Contra Costa and Solano counties.\n\nThe food bank is already feeding 65,000 households a month, which makes up nearly 3 million meals, between the two Bay Area counties.\n\nSly anticipates many neighbors will be needing the food bank's help for the first time in light of the CalFresh delays. She says state data shows only one-third of CalFresh recipients also utilize help from a local food bank statewide. For that group and the remaining two-thirds, she anticipates there will be a huge influx of need.\n\nThe food bank posted a message of warning on its website.\n\n\"We know that we're going to see tens of thousands of more people coming to us,\" said Sly. \"We are prepared to ramp up service at all of our sites and support our partner agencies as well.\"\n\nThe delays will impact real people like Christina, who chose not to provide her last name, of Fairfield.\n\nChristina relies on monthly CalFresh payments to keep food on the table.\n\n\"It changed my life. It takes a lot of burden off me, so it's not so stressful,\" Christina said. \"Because I'm a diabetic and it's good to get veggies and fresh fruits and healthy foods, not processed food.\"\n\nChristina used to line up for free food at St. Mark's food pantry in Fairfield, which is a partner agency of the Solano food bank. Now, she volunteers there almost daily and knows she can relate to those who show up on an empty stomach.\n\n\"It's going to be a lot of people out there doing some crazy stuff. People need the food stamps, they need to eat. They're going to be very desperate,\" said Christina.\n\nShe worries, with CalFresh payments paused, where she and others in need in Solano County will be.\n\n\"I'm on a fixed income, so I'm going to have to figure out how I'm going to buy food and it's going to be hard,\" said Christina.\n\nIn light of federal funding cuts in early 2025 for food programs nationwide, Sly says they are working with fewer resources and an ever-growing need.\n\n\"We just really look to our local community to step up and help us during this time,\" said Sly. \"It's very critical, especially as we go into the holiday season, which is a time when we always have an increased need and try to do more for families that can't put a holiday meal on the table.\"\n\nThe food bank says they have no choice but to be ready to respond.\n\n\"It is emotional, because all of us deeply care about our neighbors. We also know it could be you. It could be me. It doesn't take much to need food,\" said Sly.\n\nAnother layer to this, Sly says, is the economic impact of a CalFresh disruption.\n\n\"Grocers are going to be impacted. Food vendors, food producers, the people that drive the delivery trucks. It's all part of the ecosystem. For every $1.00 of CalFresh benefits that are put on somebody's EBT card, that generates $1.54 in local economic activity. So, it really does impact all of us,\" said Sly.\n\nTo the politicians in Washington, Christina urges action to end the government shutdown.\n\n\"Get your act together and get it done. Get it done,\" Christina said.\n\nFor help finding food in Solano County, visit the food bank's website.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom on Wednesday announced his plan to deploy California National Guard members to help food banks statewide respond to an increased need for their services, also fast-tracking up to $80 million in state funds.\n\nThe state of California posted answers online to frequently asked questions about the shutdown and its impact to CalFresh recipients.",

        "description": "Sacramento's flood protection projects are falling behind and that could have triggered a new building ban due to delays.\n\nA similar moratorium was in effect for seven years up until 2015. Now there's been a last-minute effort to extend the Dec. 31 deadline.\n\nHomes in Sacramento's Natomas neighborhood could be under 16 feet of water if the river levee ever broke.\n\n\"There's a lot of different flood threats that could possibly happen in the Sacramento region; we're not called the river city for no reason,\" said Sean de Guzman, the flood operations manager at the California Department of Water Resources.\n\nThat's why, back in 2007, state lawmakers set a deadline requiring Sacramento to have a 200-year level of flood protection by the end of this year.\n\n\"We have really tried to hold everybody's feet to the fire,\" said Senator John Laird.\n\nMissing the deadline effectively requires a moratorium on new construction in Natomas and south Sacramento, preventing 2,600 homes and a proposed new hospital from being built.\n\nBut just before the building ban would have taken effect, Governor Gavin Newsom extended the deadline another five years.\n\n\"This timeline ensures that we can responsibly complete our flood protection efforts while avoiding unintended economic disruption or halted growth in the region,\" said Audrey Ratajczak.\n\nSo what flood protection projects won't meet the original 2025 deadline?\n\nWork continues on strengthening the levee along the Garden Highway between Interstate 5 and Interstate 80, with crews installing an underground slurry wall that prevents seepage.\n\nTwo sump station improvement projects are behind schedule in Sacramento's Delta Shores neighborhood, which pumps away stormwater runoff.\n\nAdditional flood protection measures are also underway across the region.\n\nAt Folsom Lake, crews are raising the dikes and dam gates another 3 1/2 feet to hold back more water during strong storms.\n\n\"That's going to provide additional flood protection, obviously, that's one of our biggest flood risks when it comes to the Sacramento region,\" Guzman said.\n\nAnd the Sacramento weir is being expanded, which diverts water into the yolo bypass when river levels rise.\n\nIn total, billions are being spent to keep Sacramento safe.\n\n\"A lot of money has been invested into flood protection and work is going to continue to be done because the job never stops,\" Guzman said.\n\nThe city of Sacramento supports the deadline extension, even though it now becomes financially liable for any increased flood damage in areas where new construction is approved.",

        "description": "SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- A major union announced a proposal Thursday to impose a one-time 5% tax on billionaires in California to address federal funding cuts to health care for low-income people.\n\nProponents, including the Service Employees International Union, hope to place the statewide measure before voters next year. The tax would be on the net worth of California's richest residents. A small portion of the money would also help fund K-12 education since the federal government has threatened to withhold grant money from public schools.\n\nBackers of the measure sent a request to Attorney General Rob Bonta this week to get approval to start collecting signatures. The proposal would have to receive more than 870,000 signatures by next spring to qualify for the ballot in November 2026. If it qualifies, it's not guaranteed to pass. Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, for example, has opposed tax hikes in the past, including those specifically targeting the rich.\n\nProponents of the initiative said it was critical to backfill cuts to Medicaid because lives are at stake.\n\n\"If we do not do this, millions of people are going to lose health care, an untold number of people will go without treatment and there will be tragedy after tragedy,\" said Dave Regan, president of SEIU-United Healthcare Workers West.\n\nBillionaires would have to pay for tax year 2026, and the money could start being appropriated in 2027. The tax would generate $100 billion in revenue for the state, backers say. The initiative says it's \"designed to make the State tax system more equitable.\"\n\nThe big tax and spending cuts law President Donald Trump signed earlier this year will cut more than $1 trillion over a decade from Medicaid and federal food assistance.\n\nThe California Budget and Policy Center, a think tank in Sacramento, estimated the state could lose $30 billion in federal funding a year for Medicaid, which would result in up to 3.4 million people losing their coverage.\n\nNewsom said earlier this month that people enrolled in Covered California, the state's health insurance marketplace, could see their monthly health care bills nearly double next year as a result of the spending cuts law.\n\n\"California has led the nation in expanding access to affordable health care, but Donald Trump is ripping it away,\" he said.\n\nProponents of the proposed ballot initiative say billionaires have an obligation to do their part.\n\n\"We hope that some and perhaps hopefully a large number of billionaires will recognize that it's important in the state where they've grown their fortune that they have a responsibility to society to preserve the future of California,\" said Emmanuel Saez, a professor of economics at the University of California, Berkeley.",

REUTERS/Mike Blake\n\nA former California Republican Party official sent his party an ominous message Thursday, sounding the alarm about the findings of a new poll that showed a massive share of voters who plan to vote in favor of California's bid to add five Democratic U.S. House seats to counter GOP efforts to gerrymander ruby red states are doing so because of President Donald Trump.\n\nA CBS News/YouGov poll conducted from Oct. 16-21 found that about 75% of likely voters who support the measure, known as Proposition 50, are motivated by opposition to Trump, or see their vote as a stance against the president. Seven in 10 of those voters say its to oppose national Republicans. Just 41% said it was to support Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA).\n\n\"Those voting for it overwhelmingly say one reason is for them to oppose the Trump administration -- which they also feel generally treats California worse than other states -- and oppose national Republicans,\" CBS News wrote in recapping the findings.\n\n\"Overall, those who see their Prop 50 vote as a national issue are backing it, and that rationale is in turn helping push the \"yes\" side of the measure into the lead.\"\n\nPolitical strategist Mike Madrid, co-founder of the anti-Trump group The Lincoln Project and former political director for the California Republican Party, sounded the alarm for the GOP over the findings.\n\n\"Really bad sign for Republicans heading into the midterms,\" he wrote on X.\n\nJake Sherman of Punchbowl News wrote on X, \"62-38. This ballot initiative is sailing. Republicans arent even really contesting it at this point.\"\n\nSherman said the findings \"bucked even what Dems were worrying about. That the polling would get worse over time.\"\n\nProgressive commentator Neera Tanden, a former senior advisor and staff secretary in the Biden administration, chimed in on X, \"Pundits really wrong on this one.\"\n\n\"Basic fact is CA propositions have grown support. The crime prop last cycle grew by leaps and bounds. Anyone saying they always fall doesn't know what they are talking about. And this prop was dependent on Trump behavior. Which has gotten worse so it grew in support,\" she added.\n\nJacob Rubashkin, deputy editor at Inside Elections, added on X, \"Been saying this for months. Unlike other ballot measures that are harder to put on a partisan spectrum or get lost in the cacophony of the ballot, Prop 50 is very easy to make a Democrats vs. Republicans fight. And in California, that means the Democrat is going to win!",

        "title": "California union proposes taxing billionaires to offset Medicaid cuts",
        "description": "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- A major union announced a proposal Thursday to impose a one-time 5% tax on billionaires in California to address federal funding cuts to health care for low-income people.\n\nProponents, including the Service Employees International Union, hope to place the statewide measure before voters next year. The tax would be on the net worth of California's richest residents. A small portion of the money would also help fund K-12 education since the federal government has threatened to withhold grant money from public schools.\n\nBackers of the measure sent a request to Attorney General Rob Bonta this week to get approval to start collecting signatures. The proposal would have to receive more than 870,000 signatures by next spring to qualify for the ballot in November 2026. If it qualifies, it's not guaranteed to pass. Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, for example, has opposed tax hikes in the past, including those specifically targeting the rich.\n\nProponents of the initiative said it was critical to backfill cuts to Medicaid because lives are at stake.\n\n\"If we do not do this, millions of people are going to lose health care, an untold number of people will go without treatment and there will be tragedy after tragedy,\" said Dave Regan, president of SEIU-United Healthcare Workers West.\n\nBillionaires would have to pay for tax year 2026, and the money could start being appropriated in 2027. The tax would generate $100 billion in revenue for the state, backers say. The initiative says it's \"designed to make the State tax system more equitable.\"\n\nThe big tax and spending cuts law President Donald Trump signed earlier this year will cut more than $1 trillion over a decade from Medicaid and federal food assistance.\n\nThe California Budget and Policy Center, a think tank in Sacramento, estimated the state could lose $30 billion in federal funding a year for Medicaid, which would result in up to 3.4 million people losing their coverage.\n\nNewsom said earlier this month that people enrolled in Covered California, the state's health insurance marketplace, could see their monthly health care bills nearly double next year as a result of the spending cuts law.\n\n\"California has led the nation in expanding access to affordable health care, but Donald Trump is ripping it away,\" he said.\n\nProponents of the proposed ballot initiative say billionaires have an obligation to do their part.\n\n\"We hope that some and perhaps hopefully a large number of billionaires will recognize that it's important in the state where they've grown their fortune that they have a responsibility to society to preserve the future of California,\" said Emmanuel Saez, a professor of economics at the University of California, Berkeley.",

        "title": "States worry about how to fill the gap in food aid ahead of a federal benefits halt",
        "description": "A federal food aid program that helps about one-eighth of Americans buy groceries stands to be paused Nov. 1 because of the government shutdown, and even some states that want to step in to fill the gap have found they can't.\n\nRecipients of the food aid, food banks, states and advocates are bracing for a pause to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, payments at the end of next week. Here's what to know.\n\nLower-income families who qualify for SNAP receive debit cards loaded each month by the federal government that work only for groceries at participating stores and farmers markets.\n\nThe average monthly benefit is $187 per person. Most beneficiaries have incomes at or below the poverty level.\n\nTime is running short to keep benefits flowing in November.\n\nCongress and President Donald Trump could strike a deal to end the federal shutdown that started Oct. 1.\n\nPHOTOS: States worry about how to fill the gap in food aid ahead of a federal benefits halt\n\nIt's also possible that the Trump administration would allocate money for the program even if the shutdown continues. The liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities estimates that about $5 billion is available in a contingency fund and is calling on the administration to use that for partial benefits in November, but it's not clear if that's being seriously discussed.\n\nThe USDA has not answered questions from The Associated Press about whether those funds might be tapped.\n\nStates have also indicated that there could be a delay in benefits even if a deal is struck to fund SNAP for November.\n\nOfficials from Alaska, New Mexico and North Dakota have said that they've considered using state money to keep the food aid flowing but fear a federal government directive may make that impossible.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees SNAP, told states earlier this month not to send information to the vendors who provide the debit cards because of uncertainty about whether the program would be funded in November.\n\nOfficials in the states say that federal control of the system appears to stand in the way of their attempts to fund the program on their own.\n\n\"Without action from USDA, I think it is highly unlikely that any states would issue November SNAP benefits,\" Carolyn Vega, a policy analyst at the advocacy group Share Our Strength, said in an email. \"On top of the technical challenges, states can't shoulder that cost, especially with the risk it wouldn't be refunded.\"\n\nSylvia Serrano gets $100 every month to help buy groceries for herself and the four grandchildren she's raising in Camden, New Jersey.\n\nTwo of her grandkids have autism, and because of their aversions to certain textures they eat only certain foods that are unlikely to be available at food banks.\n\nThe act of getting food could also be harder for her without SNAP. She now does her shopping while the kids are at school, using a grocery store that's close to home due to her not-so-reliable car.\n\nShe says that with SNAP, she can mostly stay up on her other expenses. Without it? \"I would have to send less payment into a bill or something in order to cover the needs and then the bills are going to get behind,\" Serrano said.\n\nVirginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, a Republican, said he was declaring a state of emergency to provide food benefits to SNAP beneficiaries, but didn't detail how.\n\nLouisiana Gov. Jeff Landry, another Republican, said he was making it a top priority to make sure \"seniors, individuals with disabilities, and children who rely on food stamps do not go hungry in Louisiana,\" but he has also not detailed how.\n\nNew Hampshire officials announced a plan to increase access to food through food banks and mobile pantries. It would require approval of a legislative committee in the GOP-controlled state.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, said this week that he would deploy the National Guard to help food banks. \"This is serious, this is urgent - and requires immediate action,\" he said.\n\nSome states are telling SNAP recipients to be ready for the benefits to stop.\n\nArkansas is advising recipients to identify food pantries and other groups that might be able to help, and to ask friends and family for aid.\n\nIt's unclear whether any benefits left on recipients EBT cards on Nov. 1 will be available to use. Arkansas officials suggest people who have balances on their cards to use it this month on shelf-stable foods.\n\nMissouri and Pennsylvania officials, on the other hand, expect previous benefits will remain accessible and are telling beneficiaries to save for November if they can.\n\nOklahoma is encouraging people who receive benefits to visit a state website that connects people with nonprofits, faith-based groups, Native American tribes and others that may be able to help with food.\n\nSeparate federal program cuts this year have already put food banks that supply food pantries in a tough spot, said George Matysik, the executive director of Share Food Program in Philadelphia.\n\nSo dealing with an anticipated surge in demand could be tough.\n\nMatysik said it's especially acute for his organization and others in Pennsylvania, where a state government budget impasse has meant at least a pause in another funding stream. He said the group has had to cut about 20% of its budget, or $8.5 million, this year.\n\n\"Any time we have a crisis, it's always the working class that feels the pain first,\" he said.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press reporters Sophie Austin in Sacramento, California; Scott Bauer in Madison, Wisconsin; Becky Bohrer in Juneau, Alaska; Jack Brook in Baton Rouge, Louisiana; Jack Dura in Bismarck, North Dakota; Susan Haigh in Hartford, Connecticut; John Hanna in Topeka, Kansas; Marc Levy in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania; Morgan Lee in Santa Fe, New Mexico; and Sean Murphy in Oklahoma City contributed to this article.",

        "description": "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters Thursday that California issued a commercial driver's license (CDL) to an illegal immigrant truck driver charged in a fatal DUI crash that killed three people.\n\n\"I can confirm that California gave this individual a license, and it is something that the Department of Transportation has already looked into,\" Leavitt said. \"I know Secretary Duffy, who's doing a phenomenal job, has spoken on this many times in the crackdown that the Department of Transportation is taking on these licenses that are wrongfully being issued to people who clearly do not deserve to uphold these positions.\"\n\nLeavitt said the individual first entered the U.S. illegally in 2022 \"and was released into our country by the previous administration.\"\n\nShe added that the Department of Transportation (DOT) was cracking down on the issuing of CDLs amid a \"disturbing pattern\" of them being given to illegal immigrants.\n\nILLEGAL IMMIGRANT TRUCKER ACCUSED IN FATAL CALIFORNIA CRASH RELEASED BY BIDEN ADMIN AFTER 2022 BORDER CROSSING\n\nJashanpreet Singh, a 21-year-old illegal immigrant from India, was accused of driving while intoxicated and causing a crash that left three people dead. He has since been arrested on suspicion of gross vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated after allegedly plowing his big rig into slow-moving traffic on the I-10 Freeway in San Bernardino County.\n\nMultiple federal law enforcement sources told Fox News that Singh was first encountered by Border Patrol agents in California's El Centro Sector in March 2022 and released into the interior of the country pending an immigration hearing.\n\nPolice say Singh never hit the brakes before slamming into the traffic jam, citing toxicology tests that confirmed impairment.\n\nPomona High School on Thursday identified two of the deceased victims of the crash as one of their assistant basketball coaches, Clarence Nelson, and his wife.\n\nThe incident comes just months after a similar fatal crash involving an illegal immigrant truck driver.\n\nILLEGAL IMMIGRANT TRUCKER ACCUSED OF KILLING THREE PEOPLE FAILED ENGLISH, ROAD TEST SIGNS: DOT\n\nOn Aug. 12, Harjinder Singh allegedly made an illegal U-turn in an unauthorized area on the Florida Turnpike, colliding with a minivan and killing three people. He was arrested in California, where he fled after the deadly crash, and was extradited to Florida.\n\nSingh crossed into the U.S. illegally in 2018 through the southern border and was able to obtain a CDL in California. The first Trump administration rejected his request for work authorization in September 2020, Department of Homeland Security (DHS) assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nOn Oct. 15, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced that the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) would withhold over $40 million from California after a probe revealed that the state failed to comply with English Language Proficiency standards.\n\nIn response to a video of the incident, Duffy said, \"This is exactly why USDOT has withheld $40 MILLION from California for failure to comply with our rules to protect drivers.

        "title": "CBS News poll on whether California's voters want Newsom, Harris to run for president",
        "description": "As the state draws national attention in part because of Proposition 50 and redistricting, Californians also weigh in on what they think the state more generally can -- and can't -- show the nation, and on the potential prospects of some of its leading political figures.\n\nA large number of Californians in his own Democratic Party say Gov. Gavin Newsom should run for president in 2028, but among California's voters overall, that view is more split.\n\n(Nationally, of course, any entrant on the Democratic side would first need to appeal to the party's rank-and-file in the primaries across many states. The perspective of home-state voters on an elected official, either in opinions or in state race results, is often taken as a view from the voters who've presumably gotten to know their work more closely over the years.)\n\nNewsom's overall approval rating as governor is positive and a little higher than the percentage who want him to run in 2028.\n\nGiven that speculation, California voters tend to think Newsom right now is paying attention to both national and state issues -- though fewer feel he is paying mind to their local issues.\n\nBy comparison, more California Democrats say Newsom should run in 2028 than say that of former Vice President Kamala Harris, who previously represented California in the Senate.\n\nFewer than a third of the state's voters -- and just under half of California Democrats -- think she should run. She won her home state when she ran in 2024.\n\nMost independents don't think Newsom or Harris should run, but by comparison, they are much more likely to think Newsom should.\n\nAs Californians are thinking about Prop 50 in national terms, we also wanted to know how they saw the state, relative to the nation on other matters, too.\n\nCalifornians think the state sets a good example for the rest of the U.S. on technology and innovation, on culture, and for a slight majority, on environmental policy.\n\nBut few think it sets a good example on housing policy (most California voters also describe the cost of living in the state more generally as unmanageable), on tax policy, on economic policy or on its politics.\n\nPerhaps related, most Californians -- including many with higher incomes -- describe the cost of living in the state as either somewhat or very unmanageable.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, California's gubernatorial race will take place next year, with the primary also still many months off to establish the top two vote getters for the November 2026 general election.\n\nAs with any contest so distant, voters can and do consider multiple candidates or potential entrants, and long before having to make a single choice. That is reflected here. For many voters, they have not heard enough about many.\n\nIn all, current Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla of California is the most considered name (though he's not a candidate, there are reports he may be considering entering the race) and particularly so among Democrats. He's also won statewide office before and by comparison is best known to voters.\n\nFormer Rep. Katie Porter remains slightly more considered than other Democrats besides Padilla, but also has a somewhat higher number saying she's not being considered.\n\nAlso as a part of the early process, there is plenty of cross-consideration. Most of the voters considering Porter are also considering Padilla, and vice versa. Democratic voters are often considering a number of the Democrats running.\n\nThe overall number who haven't heard enough, and who are cross-considering, only emphasizes the point that in the minds of voters that this next-year contest is only just beginning to take shape.\n\nIn a state where voters of one party outnumber the other by such a wide margin, one dynamic to watch is who is seen as trying to earn votes or as taking them for granted. Neither party does especially well overall, with Democrats faring a little better than Republicans on being seen as trying to earn votes, but also worse on perceptions of taking votes for granted. A lot of independents are skeptical of both parties, with only about a quarter of them feeling that California's Democrats or its Republicans try to earn their votes.",

        "title": "Obama the 'campaign closer' for Democrats in top 2025 elections as party aims to rebound",
        "description": "In the final stretch leading up to Election Day 2025, former President Barack Obama is everywhere.\n\nFrom coast to coast, the former president is hoping to help push fellow Democrats over the finish line in the most high-profile and consequential ballot box showdowns this year as his party aims to rebound following last year's election setbacks.\n\n\"A lot of us do not believe that politicians should choose their voters, they believe the voters should choose who's going to represent them. That's the meaning of democracy,\" the former two-term president said Wednesday as he joined California Gov. Gavin Newsom on an organizing call for California's Proposition 50.\n\nHEAD HERE FOR THE LATEST FOX NEWS REPORTING ON THE 2025 ELECTIONS\n\nAnd on Nov. 1, which is the final Saturday before Election Day, Obama will headline rallies in New Jersey and Virginia, the only two states holding elections for governor this year.\n\nCalifornia voters will decide in next month's election whether to pass the proposition, which will give congressional redistricting powers in the left-leaning state back to the Democrat-dominated legislature over the coming years.\n\nThe move would likely create up to five more blue-leaning U.S. House seats in the nation's most populous state, and counter new maps drawn in GOP-dominated Texas, Missouri, and North Carolina that will likely create up to seven Republican-leaning districts.\n\nFIVE KEY RACES TO WATCH WITH TWO WEEKS UNTIL ELECTION DAY\n\nIt's part of a broad effort by the GOP to pad its razor-thin House majority to keep control of the chamber in the 2026 midterms when the party in power traditionally faces political headwinds and loses seats. Democrats need a pickup of just three seats to win back control of the House.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and his political team are aiming to prevent what happened during his first term in the White House when Democrats reclaimed the House majority in the 2018 midterm elections.\n\nObama argued that the Trump-led effort by Republicans across the country is \"brazen.\"\n\n\"The problem that we are seeing right now is that our current president and his administration is explicitly saying that we want to change the rules of the game mid-stream in order to insulate ourselves from the people's judgment,\" the former president said as he joined Newsom.\n\nObama, who is appearing in \"Yes on 50\" TV ads, said that passing the proposition in California would give Democrats \"a chance, at least, to create a level playing field in the upcoming midterm elections.\"\n\nBATTLE FOR GOVERNOR IN THIS CLOSELY WATCHED RACE MAY BE HEADED FOR A PHOTO FINISH\n\nThe former president is also appearing in ads in New Jersey for Democratic gubernatorial nominee Rep. Mikie Sherrill, who's locked in a close contest with GOP rival Jack Ciattarelli in the race to succeed term-limited Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat.\n\nAnd he's starring in spots for former Rep. Abigail Spanberger, the Democratic gubernatorial nominee in Virginia, who's facing off against Republican rival Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears in the showdown to succeed term-limited GOP Gov. Glenn Youngkin.\n\nFor Democrats, who are aiming to escape the political wilderness after losing control of the White House and Senate majority and falling short in winning back the House last year, the 2025 ballot box showdowns are their first major shot at redemption, and they hope that Obama's two-state swing will energize their base voters.\n\nBut for the former president, whose crowning domestic achievement -- the Affordable Care Act, which is better known as Obamacare -- is front-and-center in the current federal government shutdown and a top issue on the 2025 campaign trail, his return to the campaign trail is also about protecting his legacy.\n\n\"President Obama reminds us what we can accomplish when we leaders are unafraid to take on big challenges to deliver,\" New Jersey Democratic gubernatorial nominee Rep. Mikie Sherrill said in a statement. \"He led historic efforts to insure millions of Americans and lower healthcare costs.\"\n\nObama is often referred to as the Democrats' campaign closer as they point to his recurring role since leaving office nine years ago as the party's most effective campaign trail communicator.\n\nAccording to a Gallup poll conducted in January, Obama had a 59% favorable rating among Americans, higher than any other living former president. And among Democrats, his favorable rating stood at an astronomical 96%.\n\n\"He's the best communicator of our generation. The pathway back lies largely in meeting people where they are, and President Obama showed in his two election victories that he can do that,\" seasoned Democratic strategist Joe Caiazzo told Fox News Digital.\n\nBut Erin Maguire, a veteran Republican strategist and communicator who served in top communications positions for then-House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy, for Trump's 2020 presidential campaign, and later led communications for Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, disagrees.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"It shows what a vacuum of leadership there is in the Democrat Party that Obama has to be the closer here,\" she emphasized.\n\nPointing to Trump's come-from-behind 2016 White House victory, Maguire argued \"there was a complete rejection of the Obama era when Donald Trump was elected to office... For Democrats, this just shows what a monumental mess their whole party is that Obama has to be the strongest voice on any of these races.\"",

(Manuel Orbegozo/Reuters)\n\nPresident Donald Trump said Thursday that he has called off plans to send a \"surge\" of federal personnel into San Francisco this weekend to target crime, an announcement that came after he had a private conversation with Mayor Daniel Lurie.\n\nTrump made his announcement on social media, saying \"friends\" who live in the city, including Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang and Salesforce chief executive Marc Benioff, asked him not to go forward with the operation. He said he agreed in a phone call with Lurie (D) late Wednesday to give the mayor more time to address crime issues.\n\nThe president's decision came as Lurie and other San Francisco leaders had denounced the pending deployment of federal personnel; protesters gathered Thursday outside Coast Guard Base Alameda, where U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers began arriving.\n\n\"I spoke to Mayor Lurie last night and he asked, very nicely, that I give him a chance to see if he can turn it around,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social. \"I told him I think he is making a mistake, because we can do it much faster, and remove the criminals that the Law does not permit him to remove ... Great people like Jensen Huang, Marc Benioff, and others have called saying that the future of San Francisco is great. They want to give it a 'shot.' Therefore, we will not surge San Francisco on Saturday. Stay tuned!\"\n\nSkip to end of carousel\n\nICE increasingly targets undocumented migrants with no criminal record\n\nThe Trump administration is increasingly targeting unauthorized immigrants with no criminal record as it ramps up arrests, a Washington Post analysis of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement data shows.\n\nEnd of carousel\n\nIn a post on X, Lurie said he received assurances from Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi L. Noem that the president was \"calling off\" enhanced federal operations.\n\nIn their call, the mayor said, \"I told him the same thing I told our residents: San Francisco is on the rise. Visitors are coming back, buildings are getting leased and purchased, and workers are coming back to the office. We have work to do, and we would welcome continued partnerships with the FBI, DEA, ATF, and U.S. Attorney to get drugs and drug dealers off our streets, but having the military and militarized immigration enforcement in our city will hinder our recovery.\"\n\nNeither Lurie's office nor DHS responded to requests for further details.\n\nThe resolution appeared, for now, to decrease mounting tensions among San Francisco leaders and the Trump administration, which has targeted Democrat-led cities for increased immigration enforcement, including Los Angeles, Washington, Boston and Chicago. Trump has sent National Guard troops to several cities, while others, including Chicago and Portland, have won temporary reprieves in court against the president's Guard deployments.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) said this week that the state would sue the Trump administration if the president attempts to direct military troops into San Francisco.\n\nSan Francisco is one of the nation's longest-standing sanctuary jurisdictions, having approved policies in 1989 that limit local cooperation with civil immigration enforcement. Former city leaders, including Newsom, who served as mayor, and former vice president Kamala Harris, a onetime San Francisco city attorney, have used their positions to vault into national prominence, with both of them viewed as potential 2028 presidential candidates.\n\nLurie has sought to avoid directly antagonizing the president, a strategy that has engendered criticism from some civil rights groups who say he has not been forceful enough. He has sought to portray San Francisco as a city that has made significant strides in reducing violent crime and homeless encampments, mitigating the need for federal intervention.\n\nIn a live video address Wednesday, Lurie said he had signed an executive directive to ensure that local police abide by sanctuary policies that prohibit them from assisting in civil immigration and respect the free speech of residents who protest the Trump administration's actions. He warned that the administration was aiming to provoke \"backlash, chaos and violence\" in American cities.\n\nBenioff sparked outrage among San Francisco leaders two weeks ago by saying he would support sending National Guard troops to the city. He later apologized for the comments and said he no longer believes such tactics are needed to address safety issues.\n\nDemocratic Reps. Nancy Pelosi and Kevin Mullin, who represent California districts that cover San Francisco, warned that federal agents could face arrest if they break California law.\n\n\"California law protects communities and prevents federal agents from taking certain actions here that we have witnessed in other states. While the President may enjoy absolute immunity courtesy of his rogue Supreme Court, those who operate under his orders do not,\" they said in a statement Wednesday. \"Our state and local authorities may arrest federal agents if they break California law -- and if they are convicted, the President cannot pardon them.\"",

        "title": "Jen Psaki: Business as usual isn't an option, so the Trump resistance is getting creative",
        "description": "For 22 hours and 37 minutes, Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon stood on the Senate floor, without sleep, without sitting down, without bathroom breaks -- all to focus the attention of the American people on the crisis facing this country.\n\nMerkley, who turns 69 on Friday, delivered a clear message. He did not argue that we are \"at risk\" of sliding into authoritarianism. He did not say that Donald Trump has authoritarian \"tendencies.\" Or that we're on the \"verge\" of authoritarianism. His message was that we are already there: Authoritarianism is here -- and it is here now.\n\n\"I've come to the Senate floor tonight to ring the alarm bells. We're in the most perilous moment, the biggest threat to our republic since the Civil War. President Trump is shredding our Constitution,\" he said. \"The authoritarian takeover is not down the street. It is not around the corner. We are in the middle of it, right now.\"\n\nFor anyone who thinks that might sound alarmist or hyperbolic, it's worth noting that Trump has been blowing through constitutional checks on his power more rapidly with each passing day.\n\nIn just the past week, we learned that Trump is reportedly demanding that the Justice Department pay him almost a quarter of a billion dollars at the expense of American taxpayers. We saw him illegally fire yet another independent government watchdog without notifying Congress. We're seeing him allow the Pentagon to restrict the way its staff and personnel engage with Congress.\n\nOn Wednesday, we learned that Trump carried out his eighth extrajudicial strike on a boat that he claimed, without evidence, was smuggling drugs. No trial, no investigation, no attempt by the Coast Guard to intervene -- just summarily executing people, guilty or not, because Trump said so.\n\nIf any of that was too subtle, this week the president began literally tearing apart the physical foundations of the executive branch -- demolishing the entirety of the historic East Wing of the White House without consultation with any review agency, without consultation with the American people and against even his own promise not to do exactly this.\n\nTo me personally, this is an absolute gut-punch. Not just because of the history of the building and the hundreds of thousands of guests who have visited the People's House and walked down the long hallway looking at the photos of former presidents and their families, but because Trump is only doing this because he is an insecure man-baby who wants a gaudy new ballroom that looks like a gilded event space from his club in Palm Beach, Fla., to boost his own fragile ego.\n\nTo paraphrase the president himself, nobody in our country has ever seen anything like this before. The kind of authoritarian power grab we're seeing from Trump right now is an entirely new challenge. That means it will require an entirely new response.\n\nBusiness as usual is not going to work. Strongly worded letters are not going to work. This moment is going to take new and creative forms of resistance from a broad swath of people to push back on it.\n\nThat is what elected officials like Merkley have tried to do. Luckily, he is not alone.\n\nOn Wednesday, we saw California Gov. Gavin Newsom send a clear message about what the National Guard is supposed to be used for, announcing that he is deploying his state's forces, not to crack down on peaceful dissent like Trump, but to support local food banks that are seeing a spike in demand after the government shutdown cut access to critical food assistance.\n\nOn Tuesday, we saw Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes sue Congress to stop Trump and his allies from preventing a duly elected Democratic representative from being sworn in to do the job she was elected to do. It's a case that could be precedent-setting and could prevent House Speaker Mike Johnson from delaying swearing in future members of Congress just over a year from now, after the midterm elections.\n\nAlso on Wednesday, we saw two former deputies to special counsel Jack Smith announce that they are not joining law firms that made deals with Trump. Instead, they've started their own, where they aim to assist \"state and local law enforcers who want to be more aggressive in investigating public officials suspected of abusing their positions for personal gain.\"\n\nNow, each of these acts of defiance is small on its own, and it's unlikely that any single one will be a game-changer overnight, but taken together, the acts start to add up and become real pushback. And not every action has to be a sweeping, headline-grabbing spectacle or come from an elected official.\n\nIn Chicago, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents have started arresting tamale vendors whom they suspect of being undocumented. In response, a brigade of cyclists started riding around to the vendors across the city and buying up their entire supply of tamales so that they could avoid getting snatched by ICE and still make a living.\n\nAnother group in Chicago has been passing out whistles to community members so that they can alert their neighbors whenever ICE shows up.\n\nIn Portland -- the city that Trump has tried to claim is overrun with violent and dangerous protesters -- a couple decided to hold their wedding outside an ICE facility, with the bride, the groom and all the guests dressed in wacky inflatable costumes to demonstrate the joy and whimsy of that city's peaceful demonstrations.\n\nOn Tuesday in North Carolina, people showed up in droves to protest the Trump-backed plan to redraw that state's congressional maps. Protests and activism in Indiana and Missouri have been making it harder for Republicans to go through with their redistricting plans in those states, as well.\n\nIn New York's Chinatown, local citizens surrounded ICE officials in an impromptu protest, as agents conducted a surprise raid on the neighborhood's street vendors.\n\nAnd of course, this past weekend we saw, according to estimates from organizers, 7 million people across the country turn out to protest this administration -- not just in big cities, but in tons of smaller communities.\n\nThe lesson here is that, in a moment when it's hard to know exactly what to do, the only answer is to do something -- to try anything and everything. That is the lesson that compelled Merkley to hold the floor of the U.S. Senate for 22 hours and 37 minutes.",

And our values have been on full display -- this is the best of our city.\"\n\nLurie said he will monitor the situation and remain \"prepared for any scenario.\" Fox News Digital has reached out to the White House and the Department of Homeland Security for comment.\n\nThe news outlet initially reported that roughly 100 U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents were conducting an operation with \"pre-identified\" targets, which could include visiting Home Depot locations around the Bay Area.\n\nMeanwhile, about 200 to 300 protesters were seen singing and chanting Thursday morning in front of the entrance to Coast Guard Island in Alameda.\n\nTrump had threatened to send federal agents and National Guard troops to San Francisco to conduct immigration enforcement operations similar to missions in Los Angeles, Portland and Chicago.\n\nThe plan was heavily criticized by California officials, including Gov. Gavin Newsom.\n\n\"Donald Trump, himself a convicted felon who pardoned felons convicted of assaulting federal law enforcement officers, is misleading the public with his false narrative that America, and especially California, is some lawless wasteland,\" Newsom said Tuesday. \"But California is proving him wrong -- in the courts and on the facts.\"\n\n\"The notion that the federal government can deploy troops into our cities with no justification grounded in reality, no oversight, no accountability, no respect for state sovereignty -- it's a direct assault on the rule of law,\" he added. \"We're drawing a line: California will always defend the Constitution, our people and our values from authoritarian overreach.\"",

        "title": "Protesters gather as federal agents arrive in the San Francisco area",
        "description": "Police used at least one flash-bang grenade to clear a handful of demonstrators from the entrance as CBP vehicles drove through.\n\nBy TERRY CHEA and CHRISTOPHER WEBER, Associated Press\n\nALAMEDA, Calif. (AP) -- Protesters gathered Thursday outside a U.S. Coast Guard base in the San Francisco Bay Area, where U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents began arriving to support federal efforts to track down immigrants in the country illegally.\n\nA few hundred people, many singing hymns and carrying signs saying \"No ICE or troops in the Bay,\" referring to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, gathered shortly after dawn outside Coast Guard Island in Alameda. Police used at least one flash-bang grenade to clear a handful of demonstrators from the entrance as CBP vehicles drove through.\n\nOrganizers urged protesters to remain peaceful, as a line of Coast Guard officers in helmets watched from just outside the entrance.\n\nThe San Francisco Chronicle, citing an anonymous source with knowledge of the operation, reported Wednesday that more than 100 CBP and other federal agents would arrive this week. San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie and California Gov. Gavin Newsom, both Democrats, condemned the move, saying it is meant to provoke violent protests.\n\nCBP did not respond to a request for comment Wednesday from The Associated Press. A statement provided to media by the Coast Guard said that \"through a whole of government approach, we are leveraging our unique authorities and capabilities to detect, deter, and interdict illegal aliens, narco-terrorists, and individuals intent on terrorism or other hostile activity before they reach our border.\"\n\nNewsom's office said Thursday people should memorize contact information in case they're detained. \"Act intelligently, take care of yourself, and don't give them the pretext they're looking for to intensify their repression,\" Newsom's office said in a post on the social platform X.\n\nSoon after the deployment was first reported Wednesday, Lurie livestreamed a nine-minute statement from City Hall, flanked by other elected officials, and cautioned against giving federal officials working from \"a playbook\" any excuse to crack down. President Donald Trump has repeatedly said he plans to deploy National Guard troops to the city to quell crime, but his administration hasn't offered a timeline for doing so.\n\n\"In cities across the country, masked immigration officials are deployed to use aggressive enforcement tactics that instill fear so people don't feel safe going about their daily lives,\" Lurie said. \"These tactics are designed to incite backlash, chaos and violence, which are then used as an excuse to deploy military personnel.\"\n\nTrump has deployed the Guard to Washington, D.C., and Memphis, Tennessee, to help fight what he says is rampant crime. Los Angeles was the first city where Trump deployed the Guard, arguing it was necessary to protect federal buildings and agents as protesters fought back against mass immigration arrests.\n\nHe has also said they are needed in Chicago and Portland, Oregon. Lawsuits from Democratic officials in both cities have so far blocked troops from going out on city streets.\n\nTrump recently renewed his musings about sending the Guard to San Francisco, telling Fox News on Sunday the city \"was truly one of the great cities of the world\" before it went \"wrong\" and \"woke.\"\n\nHis assertions of out-of-control crime in the city of roughly 830,000 have baffled local and state leaders, who point to statistics showing that many crimes are at record lows.\n\nNewsom's administration said it would push back on any deployment, as it did when Trump ordered the Guard into Los Angeles against the governor's wishes. California Attorney General Rob Bonta vowed to \"be in court within hours, if not minutes,\" if there is a federal deployment. San Francisco City Attorney David Chiu promised the same.\n\nCoast Guard Island is an artificial island formed in 1913, and the Coast Guard first established a base there in 1926. The island is owned by the federal government and is not open to the general public, so escorts or specific government ID cards are required for visitors. The Coast Guard is part of the Department of Homeland Security, which also houses ICE and CBP.",

It would be hilarious if he did. It would be one of the funniest things of all time if an 82-year-old man steps into the office of governor of California,\" Rogan continued.\n\nHe then launched into an impression of the president, saying: \"'We're gonna fix everything. You've got a problem with water, I know how to get the water.' It would be f -- ing hilarious.\"\n\nEarlier in the show, Rogan said he recently spoke with a friend who is fleeing Los Angeles because he can't stand the state's politics anymore.\n\n\"It's like everybody went crazy. It's like there's something that happened because of the pandemic and the Black Lives Matter protests and the riots and all the chaos,\" Rogan said.\n\n\"Whatever the temperature of society was, it hit societal global warming where it's like - it's time to investigate Greenland. It's time to move north, like this is a bad climate now.

He previously called Newsom a \"bulls-t artist\" who \"ruined\" California.\n\nNewsom responded earlier this month by daring \"that son of a bitch\" Rogan to \"invite\" him onto an episode of his podcast.\n\nThe next California gubernatorial election is in 2026.

President Donald Trump has repeatedly said he plans to deploy National Guard troops to the city to quell crime, but his administration hasn't offered a timeline for doing so.\n\n\"In cities across the country, masked immigration officials are deployed to use aggressive enforcement tactics that instill fear so people don't feel safe going about their daily lives,\" Lurie said. \"These tactics are designed to incite backlash, chaos and violence, which are then used as an excuse to deploy military personnel.\"\n\nAs is his custom, Lurie did not refer to the president or address him by name.\n\nTrump has deployed the Guard to Washington, D.C., and Memphis, Tennessee, to help fight what he says is rampant crime. Los Angeles was the first city where Trump deployed the Guard, arguing it was necessary to protect federal buildings and federal agents as protesters fought back against mass immigration arrests.\n\nHe has since said they are needed in Chicago and Portland, Oregon, as well, although lawsuits by Democratic officials in both cities have so far blocked troops from going out on city streets.\n\nTrump recently renewed his musings about sending the Guard to San Francisco, saying in a Fox News interview Sunday that the city \"was truly one of the great cities of the world\" before it went \"wrong\" and \"woke.\"\n\nHis assertions of out-of-control crime in the city of roughly 830,000 has baffled local and state leaders who point to statistics showing that many crimes are at record lows.\n\nNewsom's administration said it would push back forcefully on any deployment, as it did when Trump first ordered the guard into Los Angeles against the governor's wishes. California Attorney General Rob Bonta vowed to \"be in court within hours, if not minutes\" if there is a federal deployment, and San Francisco City Attorney David Chiu has promised the same.\n\nAt a news conference Wednesday, Newsom held up what he said was a lawsuit the state would file if Trump sends troops to San Francisco.\n\n\"We're going to be fierce in terms of our response,\" said Newsom, a former mayor of San Francisco. \"This is the lawsuit that I will file within a nanosecond of any efforts to send the military to one of America's great cities.\"\n\nThe Coast Guard base in Alameda that is hosting the CBP agents is between Oakland and San Francisco, both sanctuary cities that do not cooperate with the federal government on civil immigration operations. A Homeland Security statement said the agency is \"targeting the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens - including murderers, rapists, gang members, pedophiles, and terrorists.\"\n\nLurie urged the public to protest peacefully. He said he had just signed an executive directive to coordinate the city's response to a potential federal deployment and provide support for immigrants.\n\nOakland Mayor Barbara Lee issued a statement saying: \"Real public safety comes from Oakland-based solutions, not federal military occupation.\"",

        "description": "The Valencia High School girls' volleyball defeated Jurupa Valley High School in straight sets in the first round of the California state playoffs on Wednesday, Oct. 22, 2025. (Provided to Fox News Digital)\n\nA nationally contentious season came to an end Wednesday night for a high school girls' volleyball team in California.\n\nJurupa Valley High School lost their first round state playoff game to Valencia High School in straight sets. The loss, presumably, marked the end of trans athlete AB Hernandez's high school volleyball career.\n\nJurupa Valley's 2025 season was overshadowed by a national controversy centered on Hernandez. The team saw 10 games forfeited off the team's schedule, and a lawsuit against the school district was filed by two current and one former teammate of Hernandez.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM\n\nStill, Hernandez and other JVHS players pressed on with their season and finished as co-champions of the River Valley League, earning a playoff match against Valencia. But it was no typical high school playoff game.\n\nMultiple sources, including board trustee Leandra Blades at the Placentia-Yorba Linda Unified School District, which houses Valencia High School, confirmed to Fox News Digital that at least one of Valencia's players did not take the court on Wednesday to avoid facing Hernandez.\n\nThen in the stands, multiple women's sports activists were present, led by California Family Council Outreach Director Sophia Lorey. The activists included local teenage girls, some of whom competed alongside or against Hernandez in the past.\n\nLorey presented videos to Fox News Digital that showed other spectators at the game heckling the girls in attendance who were there with Lorey.\n\nAnd for all the pomp and circumstance, it wasn't even Hernandez's first playoff volleyball game. Hernandez had competed for Jurupa Valley each of the last three years and went to the postseason in 2024 as well.\n\nBut the added national attention and controversy befell the team this year after Hernandez was thrust into the center of a political conflict between President Donald Trump and California Gov. Gavin Newsom at the end of the track and field season in the spring.\n\nHernandez made a run to the girls' state finals in long jump, triple jump and high jump, prompting Trump to send a Truth Social post in the days ahead of the event warning Newsom and the state not to allow a trans athlete to compete in the girls' events. Trump signed an executive order to prohibit schools from allowing biological males to play in girls' sports in February, but the California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) has persistently defied it.\n\nInstead, the CIF changed its rules to award any female athlete who competed in the same events to Hernandez a spot in the competition or one spot higher on the medal podium if they finished behind a biological male athlete.\n\nINSIDE GAVIN NEWSOM'S TRANSGENDER VOLLEYBALL CRISIS\n\nHernandez went on to take first place in high jump and triple jump, and second place in long jump.\n\nThe rule change resulted in Hernandez sharing podium spots with female athletes who finished behind the trans athlete in the state finals.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice then filed a lawsuit against the CIF and California Department of Education a month later in July for refusing to change its transgender policies to comply with Trump's \"Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports\" executive order.\n\nNewsom's office previously provided a statement to Fox News Digital, deferring responsibility for the situation to the CIF, CDE and state legislature.\n\n\"CIF is an independent nonprofit that governs high school sports. The California Department of Education is a separate constitutional office. Neither is under the Governor's authority. CIF and the CDE have stated they follow existing state law -- a law that was passed in 2013 and signed by Governor Jerry Brown (not Newsom) and in line with 21 other states. For the law to change, the legislature would need to send the Governor a bill. They have not,\" the statement read.\n\nOn April 1, the California state legislature blocked two bills that would reverse the current law which allows males in girls' sports. Every Democrat voted against it, with Assembly member Rick Chavez Zbur arguing that one of the bills \"is really reminiscent to me of what happened in Nazi Germany in the 1930s. We are moving towards autocracy in this country. In Nazi Germany, transgender people were persecuted, barred from public life.\"\n\nZbur said this while in the presence of a descendant of a Holocaust survivor, who had to excuse herself from the chamber, according to GOP Assembly member Kate Sanchez.\n\n\"She stood up and left because she was just so disgusted with the comparison,\" Sanchez told Fox News Digital.\n\nNo policy changes were made. So Hernandez was allowed to compete as a girl, become a national spectacle, and then play out a final high school volleyball season, igniting protests from opponents and teammates alike.\n\nTwo of Jurupa Valley's senior players, McPherson and Hadeel Hazameh, stepped away from the team this season in protest of the trans athlete.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nMcPherson and Hazameh have also filed a lawsuit against the Jurupa Unified School District citing their experience playing and sharing a locker room with Hernandez the previous three seasons. McPherson's older sister and former JVHS girls' volleyball player Madison McPherson is the third plaintiff in that lawsuit.\n\nAn now with the fall sports season coming to a close, Hernandez is still eligible to compete in one more girls' track and field season in the spring.",

Gavin Newsom on Wednesday threatened to sue the Trump administration if National Guard troops are sent to San Francisco.\n\n\"Send troops to San Francisco and we will sue you, @realDonaldTrump,\" Newsom wrote on X.\n\n\"We're going to be fierce, we're going to be focused in terms of our response. Quite literally, this is the lawsuit that I will file within a nanosecond of any effort to send the military to one of America's great cities, San Francisco,\" he said at a news conference while raising a document.\n\nThe governor said California officials \"will push back with clarity and conviction,\" adding that they will \"continue to win in court.\"\n\nTRUMP'S IMPENDING SAN FRANCISCO CRACKDOWN SPARKS BACKLASH FROM NEWSOM, MAYOR\n\nThis comes after President Donald Trump told Fox News' Maria Bartiromo that the National Guard is headed to San Francisco next, after it was already deployed to various U.S. cities, including Los Angeles, Chicago and Washington, D.C., to help reduce crime, support federal immigration enforcement and respond to protests.\n\n\"We're going to go to San Francisco,\" Trump said on Sunday. \"The difference is, I think they want us in San Francisco. San Francisco was truly one of the great cities of the world, and then 15 years ago, it went wrong. It went woke.\"\n\nThe administration is also deploying 100 agents from Customs and Border Protection and from Coast Guard Base Alameda to San Francisco, according to the San Francisco Chronicle.\n\nNewsom also vowed on Tuesday that California would challenge the federal government in court if it deployed troops to San Francisco.\n\nNEWSOM SUES TRUMP ADMINISTRATION OVER CALIFORNIA NATIONAL GUARD DEPLOYMENT ORDER TO OREGON\n\n\"We're a nation of laws and accountability -- not a nation that turns a blind eye to abuse of power,\" he said in a statement. \"Donald Trump, himself a convicted felon who pardoned felons convicted of assaulting federal law enforcement officers, is misleading the public with his false narrative that America, and especially California, is some lawless wasteland.\"\n\n\"But California is proving him wrong -- in the courts and on the facts,\" the governor continued. \"We don't bow to kings, and we're standing up to this wannabe tyrant. The notion that the federal government can deploy troops into our cities with no justification grounded in reality, no oversight, no accountability, no respect for state sovereignty -- it's a direct assault on the rule of law. We're drawing a line: California will always defend the Constitution, our people, and our values from authoritarian overreach.\"\n\nNewsom has touted San Francisco's drop in homicides, and the city's mayor, Democrat Daniel Lurie, affirmed that the city is safe.\n\n\"We got this in San Francisco,\" the mayor told The Associated Press last week.\n\nLurie said on Monday that San Francisco would welcome more federal help to crack down on drug dealers and drug markets but that he opposed the deployment of the National Guard.\n\n\"The National Guard does not have the authority to arrest drug dealers -- and sending them to San Francisco will do nothing to get fentanyl off the streets or make our city safer,\" he told The Associated Press.\n\nCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nCalifornia officials sued the administration over the summer when it sent the National Guard and Marines to Los Angeles to gain control over anti-ICE protests.\n\n\"California has seen enough. President Trump and Stephen Miller's authoritarian playbook is coming for another of our cities, and violence and vandalism are exactly what they're looking for to invoke chaos.

        "title": "Opinion | Trump Has a Religion. What Do Democrats Have?",
        "description": "The Conversation convenes this week with the Opinion columnist David Brooks, the contributing Opinion writer E.J. Dionne Jr. and the former host of NPR's \"All Things Considered\" Robert Siegel to discuss and debate Zohran Mamdani's mayoral run, gerrymandering and what the No Kings protests achieved.\n\nBelow is a transcript of an episode of \"The Opinions.\" We recommend listening to it in its original form for the full effect. You can do so using the player above or on the NYTimes app, Apple, Spotify, Amazon Music, YouTube, iHeartRadio or wherever you get your podcasts.\n\nThe transcript has been lightly edited for length and clarity.\n\nRobert Siegel: I'm Robert Siegel, now a contributor to Times Opinion. I'm in conversation with two old friends, both of The New York Times. Columnist David Brooks: How are you?\n\nDavid Brooks: How are you?\n\nRobert Siegel: And contributing Opinion writer E.J. Dionne.\n\nE.J. Dionne Jr.: Great to be with you, always.\n\nSiegel: Once again, we're together to talk about politics -- and there is no shortage of things to talk about. Last month we started off with the question of authoritarianism. Do all the various claims of new presidential powers amount to a loss of fundamental liberties? Well, it seems that several million Americans think so.\n\nThey turned out all around the country to protest against kings. So let's start there.\n\nE.J., what did you make of the No Kings protests? What did you see in it? And what did you make of the reactions to it?\n\nDionne: Well, I went down to the one here in D.C., and what I saw was patriotism.\n\nThe symbol that was most on offer everywhere along the march route was the American flag. There was even one part of the march where a bunch of people respectfully held out a very large American flag, and little kids were running underneath the flag -- because there were a lot of kids there with their parents. It was a very, if I may say so of a march in D.C., a Middle American march.\n\nI think you saw that in a lot of parts of the country. And I think it put the lie to something that I found really disturbing from Speaker Mike Johnson -- and others on the Republican side said this -- they referred to it as the Hate America rally. It couldn't have been more different than that.\n\nSince we are on authoritarian watch here, I think it was such a disturbing thing for him to say, because if you are opposed to his party or opposed to the president he supports, that means you hate America. One party, one leader, one country is something that our soldiers fought against in many wars. That's not a conception of Americanism.\n\nA lot of those people who were marching were very aware of the acceleration of the move toward authoritarianism. You think of the prosecution, the indictments of James Comey, Letitia James, John Bolton -- the first two utterly without reason, except that the president hates them.\n\nI think the people at this march weren't ideological. They were just deeply concerned about the direction of the country.\n\nSiegel: Well, David, you called for a national movement as what we need -- first in a column back in the spring, and most recently in a longer piece in The Atlantic. Is the No Kings movement the movement you had in mind? Does it fit the bill?\n\nBrooks: It's getting there. It's weird for me; I'm not a movement guy -- I'm more conservative than not, and now I find myself reading Saul Alinsky and all these lefties. I'm going, \"Yeah, power to the people.\" So I'm going total revolutionary here.\n\nDionne: It's about time, David. [Laughs.]\n\nBrooks: What I liked about No Kings rallies was just what E.J. mentioned: that people like me, who are kind of center right, would feel completely at home there.\n\nIf it starts looking like Occupy Wall Street, then I think: Good for you people, but it's not for me. I'm hanging around Occupy and my hair starts falling out. But around No Kings, I just feel it's pro-American. It's basically in line with the cultural DNA of this country. So I'm very impressed by it.\n\nI think a couple of reservations I have -- not criticisms, but things that are not yet there -- if you look back at social movements that have succeeded, they're decentralized. They happen all over, but there are always central collaborating committees. You look at the civil rights movement and they had the N.A.A.C.P., all these acronyms of all these organizations who were leading.\n\nSecond, I do think you need leaders, and I think sometimes, like Occupy, people are averse to having one person at the top. But without that, you can't control your message. You can't really conduct a strategy.\n\nThe civil rights movement conducted a soap opera every day. They told the story every day about segregation, and through that repeated storytelling, you really built the movement. You gave the segregators an unwinnable proposition. When you control the streets, either they cede the streets to you or they crack down on you and look like monsters. And that's a way to achieve civic power.\n\nThe final thing that I think No Kings is so far not making is a vision. Donald Trump has a vision. Trump is a culture. He has a core story: The elites have betrayed you. But he doesn't only have that story. He has a culture of MAGA, a culture of what a man looks like, what a woman looks like. He has a religion, basically, if you looked at the Charlie Kirk memorial service. He gives you identity. He gives you belonging.\n\nIt takes a counterculture to best the culture that Donald Trump is leading. And so far, the Democrats don't have that; they have a bunch of tax credits. And so far, the No Kings movement doesn't have that.\n\nDionne: There was a lot of stuff in your piece I appreciate. I particularly like the line where you said Trumpism is seeking \"to amputate the higher elements of the human spirit -- learning, compassion, science and the pursuit of justice, and supplant those virtues with greed, retribution, ego and appetite.\"\n\nThere's some very good stuff here.\n\nBut I'll tell you where I take issue with you. You talked about a miasma of passivity that seems to have swept over the anti-Trump ranks. I don't think that's true at all. I think that you've seen this movement grow.\n\nI think that what is making things difficult is, in our history, I think it's fair to say that we have never confronted a government that was willing to break the law as freely -- not just break norms, which they haven't cared about for a long time, but break the law as freely.\n\nWe haven't seen a situation where all of the institutions of government are behaving in a partisan way. The Congress is behaving in a partisan way. And on many of these cases, most so far, the Supreme Court is behaving in a partisan way.\n\nSo people are trying to find purchase here. Where we partly agree is on this need for a strong movement across the country.\n\nI read a very good book this week by Suzanne Mettler and Trevor Brown called \"Rural Versus Urban.\"\n\nI think that you need to revisit organizing all the way down in the country, and you need to put pressure on Republicans. Because until some of the Republicans who clearly know better are willing to say so, it's going to be very hard to break this power that Trump is amassing.\n\nBrooks: Well, he has the core story that people believe in: The elites have betrayed you. The passivity I was talking about was not so much at the bottom, though. I do think it's there. It's at the top.\n\nDionne: There, I agree with you.\n\nBrooks: It's the head of the companies, it's the head of universities, the head of law firms. They're just lying low -- in part because they're intimidated, in part just because of the collective action problem. Who's going to step out first?\n\nI had a friend, a business leader, who went to Europe and he said, \"We've lost faith in the United States forever.\" And I said, \"It's like Taylor Swift: 'We are never getting back together.'\"\n\nAnd the European said something interesting: It's not because you elected Trump. We all have Trumps in our countries, so any country could do that. It's because you didn't rise up.\n\nHe's looking at his business leaders, and he's seeing them say something in private about how awful things are going, and then in public speaking a very different language. And you can measure the amount of authoritarianism in a country by how high the price is to oppose it.\n\nDionne: Totally agree about a lot of business leaders, but let's look at some real pushback. Some law firms went over to Trump, but a whole lot of law firms said: We are not going there.\n\nThey went after Jimmy Kimmel, a whole lot of people protested, and Jimmy Kimmel was put back on the air.\n\nA lot of universities are saying no to what Trump is doing. So I totally agree with you that I want more pushback from people at the very top of the economy, but I think you're seeing seeds of revolt that are very useful.\n\nSiegel: But let me ask you both this: David, your article made me think back to the civil rights movement and my extremely minute role as a onetime member of the Stuyvesant High School Friends of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee.\n\nDionne: God bless you.\n\nSiegel: The civil rights movement achieved a major Civil Rights Act, the Voting Rights Act, constitutional amendment against poll taxes. After the restoration of the Medicaid tax break, I don't know what the agenda of the No Kings movement is. I assume they can't enact it now, but I don't even know what would be on the wish list.\n\nBrooks: I think that's the wrong way to think about it, with all due respect to my friend. You went to Stuyvesant High School. That shows you're smarter. [Laughs.]\n\nBut I don't think the anti-Trump forces understand the nature of the fight, which is that Trumpism didn't emerge overnight. It started, in some ways, back in the 19th century, with Know Nothing.\n\nBut it really started with people like Sam Francis and Christopher Lasch with his book \"The Revolt of the Elites.\" There was a big intellectual movement, and Trump just picked up everything Christopher Lasch wrote in that book in 1995. So what you need is a whole movement and a vision, and it has to be intellectual first.\n\nWhat I think Democrats need to do is understand that they can't go back to their core narratives. Democrats have had some great narratives. The New Deal: We're going to soften capitalism and make it more humane. In the 1960s: We're going to take people who've been marginalized and we're going to give them respect. Those are great narratives, but they're not narratives right now.\n\nThe final thing I'd say is there's a Bulgarian political scientist who made the observation that once the revolution happens, everybody changes. So, it's not just the Republican Party. He makes a point that the Democratic Party is going to change just as much as the Republican Party. And then he makes the point that once the revolution happens, you can't go back to who you were.\n\nHe phrases it this way: \"You can have Kerensky before Lenin, but you can't have Kerensky after Lenin.\" And Kerensky, for those who didn't go to City College in the 1930s, was a sort of a Democrat before the Russian Revolution. Once Lenin comes along and creates the revolution, you're not going to go back to the moderate Kerensky.\n\nSo I just emphasize how radically different people have to think about where we're going to be in five years.\n\nSiegel: Well, on that note, let's turn to the races that are on the ballot in November. The odd-numbered year after the presidential election always draws our attention to New Jersey and Virginia, which elect a governor in that year, and of course New York City, which elects a mayor in that year.\n\nAnd this year, there's a special interest in a California referendum on congressional redistricting. David, which of these races do you find especially interesting?\n\nBrooks: I'm going to go to where E.J. wants to go, because I am a good friend: Mamdani.\n\nI'm profoundly impressed by how much the Democrats want to be the party of rich people. If you look at how Mamdani did against Cuomo in the primary, Cuomo did very well among working-class voters and Mamdani did very well among workers making $200,000 a year.\n\nHe is a perfect candidate for educated elites. His dad is a professor. His mom's a filmmaker. Nothing wrong with that. My dad was a professor. He has the cultural values and progressive politics that go over well in Prospect Heights or in Park Slope -- these are neighborhoods in New York -- and would go over well in Santa Monica, would go over well in various affluent places.\n\nBut to me, the core problem for the Democrats is they need to win the working class back. And if he's their face, which he is about to be, I just think that's a setback to the core problem for the Democratic Party.\n\nSiegel: But isn't he running against the high cost of living? No one can afford an apartment at the rate things are going.\n\nBrooks: Yeah, but he's doing things that are outside the mainstream. Our colleagues on the editorial board produced a data-strewn editorial, and it was basically about something called the center voter theory -- that you run to the center and you win by running to the center.\n\nThat may not be true in New York, because New York has a lot of rich progressives, but it's generally true. So running to the center is probably a smart thing to do.\n\nDo Mamdani's ideas appeal to me? No. I don't think government knows how to run a grocery store. New York already has a lot of great family grocery stores. That's one of the beauties of New York: There are bodegas everywhere. His ideas sound good if you haven't lived through socialism, but socialism is still socialism.\n\nDionne: I find it amazing, David, that you're saying that the richest people in New York support Mamdani.\n\nI wish I could do a really good Bernie, but \"the millionaires and the billionaires\" are all supporting Andrew Cuomo over Mamdani. I looked at the great map The New York Times had of the primary -- every precinct facing Central Park except one little one way up in the northwestern corner.\n\nBrooks: I didn't say the millionaires and billionaires. I said $200,000. That's his sweet spot.\n\nDionne: It's sort of $50,000 to $200,000. And I think that what's interesting about Mamdani -- two things.\n\nOne, let's celebrate the paperback of your new book, \"How to Know a Person,\" and Mamdani acts like he read your book.\n\nHow did he start his campaign? He went to the Bronx when he was at 1 percent in the polls and went to precincts where Donald Trump did well or better than a Republican had done in a long time and he asked people: Why did you vote for Trump? Or: Why didn't you vote at all?\n\nWhat did they tell him? They said they were worried about the cost of living. How did he orient his campaign?\n\nYou can argue with this or that proposal, but the entire campaign has been oriented around not cultural issues -- he's a cultural progressive, but that's not what he talks about. He talks about the high cost of housing, he talks about the high cost of child care, the high cost of groceries, the high cost of transportation. He has run an economically based campaign to say New York should be affordable to everybody.\n\nAnd I wrote a column in The Times saying that he was a \"sewer socialist,\" which to many people might sound like I'm running him down, but I was actually building him up. Because the kinds of socialists who have succeeded in American history -- there was a big movement for municipal socialism; Dan Hoan was mayor of Milwaukee for 24 years as a socialist -- focused on fixing problems: fixing the sewers, which are making people sick in working-class neighborhoods.\n\nBernie Sanders, who was a mayor, talked about making sure the snow was picked up in working-class neighborhoods. So, it's snow socialism to sewer socialism. I think he is very grounded and down to earth, and he is running, in an odd way, a campaign that's quite related to that New York Times editorial that you referenced, even though its underlying message was rather different from Mamdani's.\n\nBrooks: Look, I love pragmatic leaders. Mike Bloomberg, he was my version. I think New York worked a lot better after Mike Bloomberg.\n\nThere was a guy in Detroit -- Duggan I think was his name, Mayor Duggan. And he was the least charismatic guy on Earth. But he said: If you want your streetlights to work, I'm your guy. He was just a boring administrator. I love those guys. And so if Mamdani was like that, I'd be all for it.\n\nAnd I should say he's a great campaigner. He's one of the more interesting people in American politics right now. So I don't take that away from him. But he is an ideological person. There's a reason he's a member of the Democratic Socialists of America, which has gone further left. A lot of the people I'd like to run the D.S.A. have all quit.\n\nThen the final thing to be said is he's got to explain why New York is so unaffordable.\n\nHouston doesn't have this problem. If you look at where people are moving, almost every fast-growing state is a Republican state with low taxes and low housing regulations. So people are moving to Tennessee, to Texas, to Florida, to South Carolina, because they create a positive business climate.\n\nNew York has spent all of our lifetimes -- and I grew up there like you; we were in the same housing project -- it's had the rent control. It's had horrible zoning regulations. It's just super hard to build. I think the vacancy rate in New York apartments is like minus zero, so there's just not enough housing.\n\nThis is something I think about all the time. I love a book called \"The Death and Life of Great American Cities\" by Jane Jacobs. Growing up, we were all told she was a hero. She saved the West Village, and that guy Robert Moses, who was putting in all these highways, he was the villain. But now it's looking like Jane Jacobs taught everybody that if you block the government, you can stop them from doing anything.\n\nSiegel: This is to block the Lower Manhattan Expressway from going through.\n\nBrooks: Suddenly, the story looks a little more complicated, because we've had 50 years of blocking all development. And this is the point our colleague Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson make in their book \"Abundance,\" or Yoni Appelbaum in a book named \"Stuck.\"\n\nThe abundance movement is an effort to get some of the zoning regulations reduced, not out of some Reaganite policy, but just because we need to be able to build things anymore. And I have my doubts that somebody that ideological is going to reduce the grip that the government has on the housing market.\n\nSiegel: E.J.?\n\nDionne: What's ironic is that Mamdani actually did an interview with Derek Thompson where he endorsed some of the core principles of abundance, and argued that you judge a government by whether it can deliver, and that he thinks that abundance raises questions that people who want government to work and want government to work on behalf of working people need to address.\n\nSiegel: OK, one other question about Election Day coming up, which is about the California referendum. My question to each of you is: Is gerrymandering OK if the other guy did it first?\n\nDionne: Well, I think the answer is -- the logic of what I'm going to say is yes.\n\nSiegel: Yes is what you'll say.\n\nDionne: I'll give you the answer straight up and then get there. I am, like a lot of people who are for the commissions like the one California cast, I think it would be better -- --\n\nSiegel: You're against politicians selecting their voters rather than voters selecting their politicians.\n\nDionne: Yes. And so, if you had a commission system or some sort of nonpartisan plan of making districts in every state of the country, that would be great. That's what I'm for.\n\nIn the absence of that, when one party -- on the order of the president or the request of the president -- goes and redraws its district lines in Texas to say \"We're going to arbitrarily create five more congressional districts\" and then other states start following and say, \"Well, we'll create more Republican districts,\" then the other side can either say, \"Gee, this is terrible, but we're still for commissions,\" or they can do what the Democrats and Governor Newsom did in California, which is say, \"We're still for commissions, but we're going to draw lines to offset those five so we have a fighting chance in the election.\"\n\nAnd Barack Obama -- who is somebody who's been fighting partisan redistricting and is one of the most effective advocates out for Prop 50 in California precisely because he liked nonpartisan redistricting -- in this circumstance, he regards it as an emergency.\n\nBrooks: You know, there was an essay written by Daniel Patrick Moynihan years ago -- I'm hitting all your sweet spots -- that was called \"Defining Deviancy Down.\"\n\nThis is what it looks like: Donald Trump defines deviancy down. We're redistricting. We're just going to pick our voters. And then Gavin Newsom matches them.\n\nAnd the people who should be offended, by the way, are the voters of California and Texas. If you live in those two states, you are basically being disenfranchised because you will be living in a district where the election outcome is predetermined.\n\nThere should be outrage about this. People fought for their vote, to have the right to vote, and now people don't care. To me, the worst example of defining deviancy down is what we've come to tolerate, just in how our politicians speak and in the crooked ways they rig the map, and suddenly nobody's bothered by this. Where's your dignity, people?\n\nThen the question I would ask E.J. is: Who was right, Obama or Newsom? And I mean Michelle Obama.\n\nShe had this famous comment years and years ago: \"When they go low, we go high.\" Gavin Newsom, maybe it's unfair to him, but the other alternative is: When they go low, we go lower. Put aside morality. What's the smart thing for Democrats to do? It's not obvious to me that sinking to the moral level of MAGA is the right answer here.\n\nIt seems to me, if people want to turn the page on this moment, they're going to want to turn the page in the way -- and this is not a great example -- of Jimmy Carter after Watergate. They're going to want to say: I want somebody so clean, somebody who respects government, somebody who plays by the rules, who will uphold the norms that I remember. And it seems to me that's actually a smarter play for Democrats.\n\nNow, I understand the temptation. You can't hand away the House in 2026. So I understand the temptation. But it seems to me the long-term play here is to go high when they go low.\n\nDionne: Just for the record -- in Texas, the State Legislature is imposing those districts on the people of Texas. In California, they are going to the voters. The voters of California themselves are going to decide in this referendum whether they think this is a necessary thing to do now or not.\n\nMy friend here, of course, always quotes Moynihan for his purposes, but I think that what Moynihan counseled very much throughout his career was political realism. This is not about some abstract argument of who goes lower or higher.\n\nOf course, there's stuff Trump does that no one should do. But in a straight-up political fight where power is at stake and where the authoritarianism we talked about earlier in our conversation really needs somebody to check it, winning that next fight really matters.\n\nAnd again, this proposal they put in California acknowledges that this is not the ideal way to do it. It's a temporary expedient.\n\nBrooks: If I could just say, I've heard this argument that in California the voters get to decide -- and I just don't understand it. There are multiple forms of democracy. We happen to live in a republic, where we elect people to make decisions for us.\n\nCalifornia has this system of referendum where it's a direct democracy. I happen to think that's an inferior form of democracy than electing people who get to make decisions. But it strikes me that Texas is not undemocratic. They're both versions of democracy.\n\nDionne: You started talking about the people, and the people here -- individual voters in California -- will have a say on this question in a way they didn't in Texas. I agree we need a mixed system.\n\nBrooks: We elect congressmen; do I have no say in what my congressman does? No, we elect people.\n\nSiegel: Well, I think we'll just have to accept you guys differ.\n\nDionne: Would you vote for Prop 50?\n\nBrooks: No comment. [Laughs] I would be sorely tempted, to be honest, just in this one case.\n\nSiegel: A great many people cast their votes, not on the basis of either foreign policy or culture war battles but on kitchen table issues -- what's happening with the price of food, price of groceries, with the price of gasoline at the pump.\n\nLife is pretty rough for a lot of Americans right now, and yet the stock market stays in record territory. It keeps setting records. Is the U.S. riding for a fall, and if not, why not?\n\nDionne: It's funny, we were talking this weekend -- transparency for our listeners and viewers -- about the fact that we wanted to talk about this. And right after I hung up the phone, I looked at my email and I had an email from Adam Roberts, an editor at The Economist. It was a newsletter which begins with the words \"You are probably more exposed to a looming market crash than you think.\"\n\nI think there are a lot of people who are extremely nervous. I don't know what's going to happen in the market. I'm a congenital bear who's predicted 10 of the last two downturns. But I do know that there is a real disconnect between what the market has been telling us and the experience of Americans.\n\nTwo really good stories in The Times this week, Sydney Ember wrote a story with the headline \"Lower-Income Americans Are Missing Car Payments,\" and she points out that this is one of the clearest indications that low- and middle-income families -- the economy's foundation -- could be starting to buckle.\n\nThe day before that, Ben Casselman and Colby Smith had a really good piece about how wealthier Americans, buoyed by the stock market, have continued to spend freely, while lower-income households are hit by inflation and weakening of the job market are pulling back.\n\nSo I don't think you can have a successful economy if the middle and the bottom are falling out. The wealthy alone cannot prop up an economy.\n\nCall me nervous, not just about the economy itself. I, again, don't know what's going to happen in the stock market, but this is a very unhealthy situation that explains why so many Americans are discontent.\n\nBrooks: I don't believe in timing the market, but I have been tempted for the past year to call my broker -- --\n\nSiegel: Go to cash [laughs] -- --\n\nBrooks: And pull the vast Brooks fortune out of the market. It'll hurt the market when you lose that much money [laughs]. But I haven't done it, and I'm glad I haven't done it because I've been wrong.\n\nThere are some really solid fundamentals. G.D.P. growth is about 3, unemployment around 4, wage growth around 4, rent inflation is going down. So, there's some good things in the economy. And yet, partly for the reasons E.J. said, and then the economic numbers, and then you look at consumer sentiment -- consumer sentiment is in the basement because people feel rotten about the country.\n\nThen the big issue here, which is that everybody is suddenly talking about if we're on the verge of an A.I. bubble. The reason for thinking we're on the verge of an A.I. bubble are pretty damn obvious: the combined bill. All these big companies, Meta and OpenAI, they're spending on the order of $400 billion or $500 billion a year. The total consumer spending on A.I. is $12 billion.\n\nWhat? You're spending $500 billion next year. And where's the revenue? Then you add the fact that you can't just build a chip plant the way you built a Ford plant, where you can use the machinery for 10 years. It's obsolete in 10 months.\n\nSo you think: Wow, they're just vastly overspending, as they did in the railways, as they did in the early car. We're going to have a big crash, and then A.I. will be fine.\n\nThe counterargument to that is that A.I. revenues, while small, are really going up fast. The second thing is, A.I. is not like any other technology. It's not like the railroads. It's like inventing omniscience. And maybe this is a remarkable opportunity. They all think so, because they're all investing zillions of dollars, but it feels a little bubble-ish to me.\n\nSiegel: Well, I've heard comparisons to the 2000s and the dot-com crash, the bubble. In an article in The Economist, the Harvard professor Gita Gopinath writes that a stock market decline comparable to the 2000 dot-com crash would wipe out, she estimates, $20 trillion in wealth for American households. That's the equivalent of about 70 percent of last year's gross domestic product, and there's just a lot of money out.\n\nBrooks: I am going to call my broker after. [Laughs.]\n\nDionne: Tell him Robert told you to.\n\nSiegel: Well, look, I think we should wrap up, as we did last time, by finding in the midst of all of this angst some joy, some experience that each of us has had recently, that might be a good antidote to stuff we follow in the news. David?\n\nBrooks: Because my wife likes people, we entertain a lot. I've actually found not as many people have people over anymore. We'll have three or four dinner parties a week sometimes, and I'm exhausted by it. I do a lot of dishes. But I found hospitality is maybe my hobby.\n\nIt's certainly a great pleasure to me, and one of the things we do is -- she has a lot of friends who are musicians. And one of my golden rules of life is never turn up the opportunity to hang around with musicians. So we've had a ton of music in the house, and it's been great -- and exhausting. [Laughs.]\n\nSiegel: E.J.?\n\nDionne: I agree with David on all of that.\n\nTwo things. One, this a great time of year for sports fans. You've got the World Series, the N.B.A. starts, middle of football season. That's fun.\n\nBut this weekend I'm going up to New York, and our youngest daughter -- not the one I mentioned the last time -- I'm going to go up to celebrate her birthday, and also walk with her when she early votes in that election in New York that we talked about. And when you can bring together love and democracy, that's utopia for me.\n\nSiegel: I spent Saturday in New York at my grandson's bar mitzvah. I am, to use a technical term, still kvelling. And what added to the joy, actually, were other things that happened to be happening at that synagogue that same morning: the welcoming of two people who just converted to Judaism, and the naming of a newborn. I thought it was a celebration of life at some of its richest moments, and I felt very enriched.\n\nDionne: Mazel tov, that's great.\n\nSiegel: I also feel enriched by hearing from you guys again. E.J. Dionne, David Brooks, Thanks so much.\n\nDionne: Thank you.\n\nBrooks: Thank you.\n\nThoughts?

        "title": "Video: Opinion | Trump Has a Religion. What Do Democrats Have?",
        "description": "Mamdani might be working in Democrats' favor. But what about \"No Kings\"?\n\nHi, I'm Robert Siegel. Now a contributor to Times Opinion. And I'm in conversation with two old friends, both of the New York Times. The columnist David Brooks. How are you? And the contributing opinion writer E.J. Dionne. Great to be with you always. Once again, we're together to talk about politics, and there is no shortage of things to talk about. Last month, we started off with the question of authoritarianism. Do all the various claims of new presidential powers amount to a loss of fundamental liberties. Well, it seems that several million Americans think so. They turned out all around the country to protest against Kings. So let's start there. E.J. what did you make of the No Kings protest? What did you see in it? And what did you make of the reactions to it? Well, I went down to the one here in D.C. and what I saw was patriotism, the symbol that was most on offer everywhere along the march route was the American flag. There was even one part of the march, there were a bunch of people who held respectfully held out a very large American flag, and little kids were running underneath the flag because there were a lot of kids there with their parents. It was a very, if I may say so, of a march in D.C., a middle American march. And I think you saw that in a lot of parts of the country. And I think it put the light as something that I found really disturbing from Speaker Mike Johnson and others on the Republican side said this. They referred to it as the hate America rally. It couldn't have been more different than that. And I think since we are on authoritarian watch here, I think it was such a disturbing thing for him to say, because if you are opposed to his party or opposed to his president, a president he supports, that means you hate America and one party, one leader, one country is something that our soldiers fought against in many wars. That's not a conception of Americanism. And I think a lot of those people who were marching were very aware of the acceleration of the move toward authoritarianism. You think of the prosecution, the indictments of James Commey, Letitia James, John Bolton, the first two utterly without reason, except that the president hates them. And so I think the people at this March weren't ideological. They were just deeply concerned about the direction of the country. Well, David, you've called for a national movement. You say, is what we need first in a column back in the spring and most recently in the longer piece in The Atlantic. Is there no No King's movement? The movement you had in mind, does it fit the bill? It's getting there. It's weird for me. I'm not a movement guy. I'm more conservative than not. And now I find myself reading Saul Alinsky and all these lefties, and I'm going Yeah Yeah, power to the people. So I'm going total revolutionary here. It's about time, David. And what I liked about the King's rallies was just what EJ mentioned, that people like E.J. who were kind of center right, would feel completely at home there. If it starts looking like Occupy Wall Street, then I think oh, good for you people. But it's not for me I'm hanging around occupy and my hair starts falling out, but around no Kings. I just feel it's pro-American. It's basically in line with the cultural DNA of this country. And so I'm very impressed by it. I think a couple reservations I would have, but I think not criticisms, but things that are not yet there. If you look back at social movements that have succeeded, they are decentralized. They happen all over. But there are always central collaborating committees. You look at the Civil Rights movement. They had the N.A.A.C.P., all these acronyms of all these organizations who are leading second. I do think you need leaders. And I think sometimes like occupy, people were averse to having one person at the top. But without that can't control your message, you can't really conduct a strategy. The civil rights movement conducted a soap opera every day. They told the story every day about segregation. And through that repeated storytelling, you really built the movement and you made the segregation laws. You gave them an unwinnable proposition. When you control the streets, either they see the streets to you, or they crack down on you and look like monsters, and that's a way to achieve civic power. The final thing that I think No Kings is so far not making is a vision. Donald Trump has a vision. Trump is a culture. It's a he has a core story. The elites have betrayed you. But he doesn't only have that story, he has a culture of MAGA, a culture of what a man looks like, what a woman looks like. He has a religion. Basically, if you looked at the Charlie Kirk Memorial service, he gives you identity, he gives you belonging. It takes a counterculture to best the culture that Donald Trump is leading. And so far, the Democrats don't have that. They have a bunch of tax credits. And so far, the No Kings movement doesn't have that E.J., there was a bunch a lot of stuff in your piece, I appreciate it. I particularly liked the line where you said Trumpism is seeking to amputate the higher elements of the human spirit, learning compassion, science and the pursuit of justice and supplant those virtues with greed, retribution, ego, and appetite. And there's some very good stuff here, but I'll tell you where I take issue with you. You talked about a miasma of passivity seems to have swept over the anti-Trump ranks. I don't think that's true at all. I think that you've seen this movement grow. I think that what is making things difficult is in our history. I think it's fair to say that we have never confronted a government that was willing to break the law as freely, not just break norms, which they are. They haven't cared about for a long time. But break the law is freely. We haven't seen the situation where all of the institutions of government are behaving in a partisan way. The Congress is behaving in a partisan way. And I think on many of these cases, most so far, the Supreme Court is behaving in a partisan way. So people are trying to find purchase here, where we probably agree is on this need for a strong movement across the country. I read a very good book this week by Suzanne Mettler and Trevor Brown called \"Rural vs. Urban.\" I think that you need to revisit organizing all the way down in the country, and you need to put pressure on Republicans, because until some of the Republicans who clearly know better are willing to say so, it's going to be very hard to break this power that Trump is amassing. Well, he has the core story that people believe in. The elites have betrayed you. The passivity I was talking about was not so much at the bottom, though I do think it's there. It's at the top and they're angry and they're like, the head of the company is the head of universities, the head of law firms. They're just laying low. And it's part because they're intimidated and part just because the collective action problem. Who's going to step out first. And I had a friend, a business leader who went to Europe. And he said, we've lost faith in the United States forever. And I said it's Taylor Swift, we are never getting back together. And the European said something interesting to me. It's not because you elected Trump. We all have Trumps in our country. So any country could do that. It's because you didn't rise up. And so he's looking at his business leaders and he's seeing them say something in private about how awful things are going. And then in public speaking a very different language. And you can measure the amount of authoritarianism in a country by how high the price is to oppose. And I totally agree about a lot of business leaders, but let's look at some real pushback. Some law firms went over to Trump, but a whole lot of law firms said, we're not going there. They went after Jimmy Kimmel and a whole lot of people protested and Jimmy Kimmel was put back on the air. A lot of universities are saying no to what Trump is doing. So I totally agree with you that I want more pushback from people at the very top of the economy. But I think you're seeing seeds of revolt that are very useful. But let me ask you both this. David, your article made me think back to the Civil Rights movement and a my extremely minute role as a one time member of the Stuyvesant High School friends of the Student nonviolent Coordinating. Bless you. And the Civil Rights movement achieved a major civil Rights Act, the Voting Rights Act, a constitutional amendment against poll taxes. I don't even know. After the restoration of the Medicaid tax break, I don't know what the agenda of the No King's movement is. I assume they can't enact it now, but I don't even know what would be on the wish list. Yeah, I think that's the wrong way to think about it. With all due respect to my friend from. I went to Stuyvesant town. You went to Stuyvesant High School. That shows you're smarter. But I don't think the anti-Trump forces understand the nature of the fight, which is that Trumpism didn't emerge overnight. It started back in some ways in the 19th century with know nothing. But it really started with people like Sam Francis, who may be unfamiliar names to Christopher Lasch. His book \"The Revolt of the Elites.\" There was a big intellectual movement, and Trump just picked up everything Christopher Lasch wrote in that book in 1995. And so what you need is a whole movement and a vision, and it has to be intellectual first. What I think Democrats need to do is understand that they can't go back to their narratives, their core narratives. Democrats have had some great narratives. The New Deal, we're going to soften capitalism and make it more humane in the 1960s. We're going to take people who have been marginalized and we're going to give them respect. Those are great narratives, but they're not narratives right now. The final thing I'd say is there's a Bulgarian political scientists who made the observation that once the revolution happened, everybody changes. So it's not just the Republican Party. He makes the point that the Democratic Party is going to change just as much as the Republican Party. And then he makes the point. Once the revolution happens, you can't go back to who you were. And he phrases it this way you can have Kerensky before Lenin, but you can't have Kerensky after Lenin and Kerensky. For those who didn't go to City College in the 1930s was a Democrat before the Russian Revolution. Once Lenin comes along and creates the revolution, you're not going to go back to the moderate Kerensky. And so I just emphasize how radically different people have to think about where we're going to be in five years. Well, on that note, let's turn to the races that are on the ballot in November. The odd numbered year after the presidential election always draws our attention to New Jersey and Virginia, which elect a governor in that year. And, of course, New York City, which elects a mayor in that year. And this year, there's special interest in California, a referendum on congressional redistricting. David, which of these races do you find especially interesting? I'm going to go to where E.J. wants to go because I am a good friend. Mamdani and so I'm profoundly impressed by how much the Democrats want to be the party of rich people. If you looked at how Mamdani did against Cuomo in the primary, Cuomo did very well among working class voters, and Romney did very well among workers making $200,000 a year or whatever. And he is a perfect candidate for educated elites. His dad was a professor. His mom's a filmmaker. Nothing wrong with that. My dad was a professor, and he has the cultural values and the progressive politics that go over well in Prospect Heights or in Park Slope. These are neighborhoods in New York and would go over well in Santa Monica and would go over well in various affluent places. But to me, the core problem for the Democrats is they need to win the working class back. And if he's their face, which he is about to be. I just think that's a setback to the core problem for the Democratic Party. But isn't he running against the high cost of living. No one can afford an apartment at the rate things are going. And yeah, but he's doing things that I think are outside the mainstream. Our colleagues on the editorial page produced a data strewn editorial, and it was basically about something called the centrist voter theory that you run to the center and you win by running to the center. And that may not be true in New York, because New York has a lot of rich progressives, but it's generally true. And so running to the center is probably a smart thing to do. Does Mandani - are his ideas, do they appeal to me? No, no, I don't think government knows how to run a grocery store. New York already has a lot of great family grocery stores. That's one of the beauties of New York. There are bodegas everywhere. And so his ideas, I think they sound good. If you haven't lived through socialism. But socialism is still socialism. I find it amazing, David, that you're saying that the richest people in New York support Mamdani? I wish I could do a really good Bernie, but the millionaires and billionaires are all supporting Andrew Cuomo over Mamdani. I looked at the great map the New York Times had of the primary. Every precinct facing Central Park except one little, one way up in the corner in the North. I didn't say the millionaires and billionaires. I said 200,000. That's his sweet spot. No, it's 50 to 200,000. And I think that what's interesting about Mamdani. Two things. One, let's celebrate the paperback of your book, your new book how to know a person. And Mamdani acts like he read your book. How did he start his campaign. He went to the Bronx when he was at 1 percent in the polls, and went to precincts where Donald Trump did well or better than a Republican had done in a long time. And he asked people, why did you vote for Trump? Or why didn't you not vote at all? What did they tell him? They said they were worried about the cost of living. How did he orient his campaign. You can argue with this or that proposal, but the entire campaign has been oriented around not cultural issues. He's a cultural progressive, but that's not what he talks about. He talks about the high cost of housing. He talks about the high cost of childcare, the high cost of groceries, the high cost of transportation. He has run an economically based campaign to say New York should be affordable to everybody. And I wrote a column in the times saying that he was a sewer socialist, which to many people might sound like I'm running them down, but I was actually building him up because the kinds of socialists who have succeeded in American history, there was a big movement for municipal socialism. Dan Hoan was mayor of Milwaukee for 24 years. As a socialist, they focused on fixing problems, fixing the sewers, which were making people sick in working class neighborhoods. Bernie Sanders, who was a mayor, talked about making sure the snow was picked up in working class neighborhoods. So its snow socialism to sewer socialism. So I think he is very grounded and down to earth and he is running, in an odd way, a campaign that's quite related to that New York Times editorial that you referenced, even though its message, underlying message was rather different from mamdani's look, I would love I love pragmatic leaders. Mike Bloomberg, he was my version. I think New York worked a lot better after Mike Bloomberg. There was a guy in New York, maybe in Detroit. You can help me. Duggan I think it was his name, Mayor Duggan. And he was like the least charismatic guy on Earth. But he said, if you want your street lights to work, I'm your guy. He was like, just a boring administrator. I love those guys. And so if Mamdani was like that, I'd be all for it. And I should say he's a great campaigner. He's one the more interesting people in American politics right now. So I don't take that away from him. But he is an ideological person. There's a reason he's a member of the Democratic Socialists of America, which has gone further left. So a lot of the people I liked who were in the D.S.A. have all quit. And so. And then the final thing to be said is he's got to explain why New York is so unaffordable. Houston doesn't have this problem. If you look at where people are moving, almost every fast growing state is a Republican State with low taxes and low housing regulations. And so people are moving to Tennessee, to Texas, to Florida, to South Carolina, because they create a positive business climate. New York has spent all of our lifetimes, and I grew up there. Like you, we were in the same housing project and has had rent control. It's had horrible zoning regulations. It's just super hard to build. And therefore, I think the vacancy rate in New York apartments is like negative 0. And so there's just not enough housing. And then finally, this one, this is something I think about all the time. I love a book called \"The Death and Life of Great American Cities\" by Jane Jacobs. Jane Jacobs and I grew up and we were all told she was a hero. She saved the West Village and that guy, Robert Moses, who was putting in all these highways. He was the villain. But now it's looking like Jane Jacobs taught everybody. If you sue the government can stop them from doing anything. And so, citizens, to block the Lower Manhattan Expressway from going through. And so suddenly the story looks a little more complicated because we've had 50 years of blocking all development. And this is the point our colleague makes. And Derek Thompson, in their book \"Abundance,\" or Yoni Appelbaum in a book named \"Stuck.\" And so the abundance movement is an effort to get some of the zoning regulations reduced, not out of some Reaganite policy, but just because we need to be able to build things anymore. And I have my doubt that some of that ideological is going to reduce the grip that government has on the housing market. What's ironic is that Mamdani actually did an interview with Derek Thompson where he endorsed some of the core principles of abundance and argued that you judge a government by whether it can deliver, and that he thinks that abundance raises questions, that people who want government to work and want government to work on behalf of working people need to address. O.K, I have one other question about election day coming up. Just one, which is about the California referendum. My question to each of you is gerrymandering O.K. if the other guy did it first. Well, I think the answer is, I guess the logic of what I'm going to say is yes. So I'll give you the answer straight up and then get there. I am like a lot of people who are for the commissions the one California cast, I think. And you're against politicians selecting their voters rather than voters selecting their politicians. And so if you had a commission system or some non-partisan plan of making districts in every state of the country, that would be great. That's what I'm for. In the absence of that, when one party on the order of the president or the request of the president goes and redraws its district lines. In Texas, we're talking about to say we're going to arbitrarily create five more congressional districts, and then other states start following and say, well, we'll create more Republican districts. Then the other side can either say, gee, this is terrible, but we're still for commissions, or they can do what the Democrats and Gavin Newsom did in California, which is say, we're still for commissions, but we're going to draw lines to offset those five. So we have a fighting chance in the election. And Barack Obama, who is somebody who's been fighting partisan redistricting, is one of the most effective advocates out for prop 50 inches California, precisely because he'd like nonpartisan redistricting. But in this circumstance, he regards it as an emergency. There was an essay written by Daniel Patrick Moynihan years ago called I'm hitting all your sweet spots that called \"Defining Deviancy Down.\" Yes. And so this is what it looks like that Donald Trump defines deviancy down with redistricting. And we're going to pick our voters. And then Gavin Newsom matches them. And the people who should be offended, by the way, are the voters of California and Texas. They are you are basically, if you live in those two states, you are basically being disenfranchised because you will be living in a district where the election outcome is predetermined. And so there should be outrage about this. People fought for their vote to have the right to vote, and now people don't care. And to me, the worst example of \"Defining Deviancy Down\" is what we've come to tolerate just in how our politicians speak and the crooked ways they rig the map. And suddenly nobody's bothered by this. And where's your dignity, people. Then the question I would ask for E.J. is who was right, Obama or Newsom. And I mean Michelle Obama - she had this famous comment years and years ago. When they go low, we go high. Gavin Newsom maybe it's unfair to him, but the other alternative is when they go low, we go lower. And so put aside morality. What's the smart thing for Democrats to do. It's not obvious to me that sinking to the moral level of MAGA is the right answer here. It seems to me if people want to turn the page on this moment, they're going to want to turn the page in a little the way they turn the page. And this is not a great example of Jimmy Carter after Watergate. They're going to want to say, I want somebody so clean, somebody who respects government, somebody who plays by the rules, who will uphold the norms that I remember. And it seems to me that's actually a smarter play for Democrats. Now, I understand the temptation. You can't hand away the house in 2026. So I understand the temptation. But it seems to me the long term play here is to go high when they go low. Just for the record, Texas, the state legislature is imposing those districts on the people of Texas. See, California. They are going to the voters, the voters of California themselves are going to decide in this referendum whether they think this is a necessary thing to do now or not. And my friend here, of course, always quotes Moynihan for his purposes. But I think that what Moynihan counseled very much throughout his career was political realism. And this is not about some abstract argument of whether who goes lower or higher. Of course, there's stuff. Trump does that No one should do. But in a straight up political fight where power is at stake and where the authoritarianism we talked about earlier in our conversation really needs somebody to check it. Winning that next fight really matters. And again, this proposal they put in California acknowledges that this is not the ideal way to do it. It's a temporary expedient. If I could just say I've heard this argument before, I just don't understand it, that California, the voters get to decide there are multiple forms of democracy. We happen to live in a Republic where we elect people to make decisions for us. California has this system of referendum where it's direct democracy. I happen to think that's an inferior form of democracy than to electing people who get to make decisions. But it strikes me that Texas is not undemocratic. And so they're both versions of democracy. They started talking about the people and the people here. Individual voters in California will have a say on this question in a way they didn't in Texas. And so I agree, we need people. Do I have no say in what my Congressman does. No we elect people. Well, I think we'll have to just accept that you guys differ about the. Would you vote for prop 50. No comment. No O.K. I would be sorely tempted, to be honest. Just in this one case. In this one case, a great many people cast their votes not on the basis of either foreign policy or culture war battles, but on kitchen table issues, what's happening with the price of food, with price of groceries, with the price of gasoline at the pump. Life is pretty rough for a lot of Americans right now. And yet the stock market stays in record territory, keeps setting records. Is the U.S. riding for a fall. And if not, why not E.J., it's funny, we were talking this weekend and transparency for our listeners and viewers about the fact that we wanted to talk about this. And right after I hung up the phone and I looked at my email and I had an email from Adam Roberts, an editor at The Economist, a newsletter, which begins with the words you are probably more exposed to a looming market crash than you think. I think there are a lot of people who are extremely nervous. I don't know what's going to happen in the market. I'm a kind of congenital bear who's predicted 10 of the last two downturns. But I do know that there is a real disconnect between what the market has been telling us and the experience of Americans. Two really good stories in The times this week. Sydney ember wrote a story, the headline lower income Americans are missing car payments, and she points out that this is one of the clearest indications that low and middle income families, the economy's foundation could be starting to buckle. Day before that, Ben Casselman and Colby Smith, they had a really good piece about how wealthier Americans, buoyed by the stock market, have continued to spend freely while lower income households are hit by inflation, a weakening of the job market or pulling back. And so I don't think you can have a successful economy if the middle and the bottom are falling out. The wealthy alone cannot prop up an economy. So call me nervous, not just about the economy itself. Again, I don't know what's going to happen in this stock market, but this is a very unhealthy situation that explains why so many Americans are discontent. I'm I don't believe in timing the market, but I've been tempted for the past year to call my broker, go to cash -- and pull the vast Brooks fortune out of the market. It will hurt the market when you lose that much money. But I haven't done it. And I'm glad I haven't done it because I've been wrong. And there are some really solid fundamentals G.D.P. growth is about three. Unemployment is around four. Wage growth is around four. Rent inflation is going down. And so there are some good things in the economy. And yet for part of the reasons E.J. said. And then you look at the economic numbers and then you look at consumer sentiment. Consumer sentiment is in the basement. And so people you look at the numbers seems O.K., but consumer sentiment is in the basement because people feel rotten about the country. And then the big issue here, which is what everybody is suddenly talking about are we on the verge of an A.I. bubble. And the reason for thinking we're on the verge of an A.I. bubble are pretty damn obvious. The combined all these big companies, Meta and OpenAI, they're spending on the order of four or $500 billion a year. We have the total consumer spending on A.I. is $12 billion. What, you're spending $500 billion next year and where's the revenue. And now they're obviously. And then you add the fact is you can't just build a chip plant the way you build a Ford plant where you can use the machinery for 10 years, it's obsolete in 10 months. And so you think, wow, they're just vastly overspending as they did in the railways as they did in the early car. We're going to have a big crash and then I will be fine. The counterargument to that is that A.I. revenues, while small, are really going up fast. And the second thing is A.I. is not like any other technology. It's not like the railroads. It's like inventing omniscience. And maybe this is a remarkable opportunity. They all think so because they're all investing zillions of dollars, but it feels a little bubblicious to me. Well, I've heard comparisons to 2000 and dotcom crash. The bubble in an article in The Economist, the Harvard professor Gita Gopinath writes that a stock market decline comparable to the 2000 dotcom crash would wipe out. She estimates, $20 trillion in wealth for American households. That's the equivalent of about 70 percent of last year's gross domestic product. And there's just a lot of money out there. I am going to call my broker after I tell him Robert told you to. Well, look, I think we should wrap up, as we did last time, by finding in the midst of all of this angst, some joy, some joy, some experience that you've had recently that each of US has had recently, that might be a good antidote to the stuff we follow in the news. David, you go first. Because my wife likes people we entertain a lot. And so I've actually found hospitality. Not as many people have people over anymore. And we'll have three or four dinner parties a week sometimes, and I'm exhausted by it. But I do a lot of dishes. But I found hospitality is like, maybe that is my hobby. It's certainly a great pleasure to me. And one of the things we do is she has a lot of friends who are musicians, and one of my golden rules of life is never turn up the opportunity to hang around with musicians. And so we've had a lot ton of music in the house. And it's been great and exhausting. I agree with David on all of that. Two things. One, this is a great time of year for sports fans. You got the World Series. The N.B.A. starts middle of the football season. That's fun. But this weekend I'm going up to New York and our youngest daughter, not the one I mentioned last time. I'm going to go up to celebrate her birthday and also walk with her when she early votes in that election in New York that we talked about. And when you can bring together love and democracy, that's utopia for me. I spent Saturday in New York at my grandson's bar mitzvah. I am, to use a technical term, still kvelling. And what added to the joy, actually, were other things that happened to be happening at that synagogue that same morning. The welcoming of two people who just converted to Judaism and the naming of a newborn. And I thought it was a celebration of life at some of its richest moments. And I felt very enriched. Mazel tov. Mazel tov. That's great. I also feel enriched by hearing from you guys again. E.J. Dionne, David Brooks, Thanks so much. Thank you. Thank you.",

        "title": "Federal agents sent to San Francisco area and mayor says it's meant to incite 'chaos and violence'",
        "description": "SAN FRANCISCO -- SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The U.S. Coast Guard said Wednesday it is providing a base of operations for U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents in the San Francisco area as part of its effort to support federal efforts to track down immigrants in the country illegally and provide border and maritime security.\n\nThe San Francisco Chronicle, citing an anonymous source with knowledge of the operation, reported more than 100 CBP and other federal agents will begin arriving Thursday at the base in Alameda, a move immediately condemned by San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie and California Gov. Gavin Newsom. The two Democrats said the surge is meant to provoke violent protests.\n\nCBP did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press. A statement provided to media by the Coast Guard said in part that \"through a whole of government approach, we are leveraging our unique authorities and capabilities to detect, deter, and interdict illegal aliens, narco-terrorists, and individuals intent on terrorism or other hostile activity before they reach our border.\"\n\nSoon after the deployment was first reported, Lurie livestreamed a nine-minute statement from City Hall, flanked by other elected officials, and cautioned against giving federal officials working from \"a playbook\" any excuse to crack down. President Donald Trump has repeatedly said he plans to deploy National Guard troops to the city to quell crime, but his administration hasn't offered a timeline for doing so.\n\n\"In cities across the country, masked immigration officials are deployed to use aggressive enforcement tactics that instill fear so people don't feel safe going about their daily lives,\" Lurie said. \"These tactics are designed to incite backlash, chaos and violence, which are then used as an excuse to deploy military personnel.\"\n\nAs is his custom, Lurie did not refer to the president or address him by name.\n\nTrump has deployed the Guard to Washington, D.C., and Memphis, Tennessee, to help fight what he says is rampant crime. Los Angeles was the first city where Trump deployed the Guard, arguing it was necessary to protect federal buildings and federal agents as protesters fought back against mass immigration arrests.\n\nHe has since said they are needed in Chicago and Portland, Oregon, as well, although lawsuits by Democratic officials in both cities have so far blocked troops from going out on city streets.\n\nTrump recently renewed his musings about sending the Guard to San Francisco, saying in a Fox News interview Sunday that the city \"was truly one of the great cities of the world\" before it went \"wrong\" and \"woke.\"\n\nHis assertions of out-of-control crime in the city of roughly 830,000 has baffled local and state leaders who point to statistics showing that many crimes are at record lows.\n\nNewsom's administration said it would push back forcefully on any deployment, as it did when Trump first ordered the guard into Los Angeles against the governor's wishes. California Attorney General Rob Bonta vowed to \"be in court within hours, if not minutes\" if there is a federal deployment, and San Francisco City Attorney David Chiu has promised the same.\n\nAt a news conference Wednesday, Newsom held up what he said was a lawsuit the state would file if Trump sends troops to San Francisco.\n\n\"We're going to be fierce in terms of our response,\" said Newsom, a former mayor of San Francisco. \"This is the lawsuit that I will file within a nanosecond of any efforts to send the military to one of America's great cities.\"\n\nThe Coast Guard base in Alameda that is hosting the CBP agents is between Oakland and San Francisco, both sanctuary cities that do not cooperate with the federal government on civil immigration operations. A Homeland Security statement said the agency is \"targeting the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens -- including murderers, rapists, gang members, pedophiles, and terrorists.\"\n\nLurie urged the public to protest peacefully. He said he had just signed an executive directive to coordinate the city's response to a potential federal deployment and provide support for immigrants.\n\nOakland Mayor Barbara Lee issued a statement saying: \"Real public safety comes from Oakland-based solutions, not federal military occupation.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Sophie Austin contributed from Sacramento, California",

        "title": "Vacaville leaders, neighbors draft city ordinance for controversial battery storage plants in charged debate",
        "description": "The community was charged on Wednesday night at a meeting hosted by the City of Vacaville concerning battery energy storage systems (BESS) and the local restrictions city leaders are working to put on them.\n\nRight now, the city has no regulations on the books for these types of facilities.\n\nIt comes as they are becoming more common under a statewide push to meet renewable energy goals. These battery energy storage facilities are a huge part of meeting Gov. Gavin Newsom's plan for all electricity sold in California to be renewable by 2045, with a 60 percent benchmark to be met by 2030.\n\n\"So many people were not aware these were even coming to Vacaville,\" said Deanna Cole, a Vacaville resident and organizer of the \"Keep Vacaville Safe\" community movement in response to the proposed battery plants.\n\nCole would neighbor a proposed battery plant near Kilkenny Road by NextEra Energy called the Corby Energy Project, which is seeking state approval from the California Energy Commission right now.\n\nThe company hosted a community meeting on the project in July.\n\nThe project sits just outside of the Vacaville city limits. The Solano County Board of Supervisors in August voted to end their moratorium on BESS facilities, updating an ordinance that now allows BESS proposals as long as they follow outlined safety regulations and if they sit on land zoned for manufacturing or industrial use.\n\n\"We're not just concerned about that project. We are worried about anything that is gonna pop up from here on out,\" said Cole.\n\nCole says the message of \"Keep Vacaville Safe\" is that these lithium-ion battery facilities, when too close to homes or hospitals, bring fire danger and an environmental nightmare.\n\nThe City of Vacaville, which has no current regulations for these types of facilities, laid out its plan Wednesday night for a new ordinance and asked neighbors for their input.\n\nCole and dozens of other neighbors showed up to the meeting to share their thoughts.\n\n\"We are taking all the risk by having this in our community. There is no benefit,\" said one neighbor in public comment.\n\nProject Planner Albert Enault with the city of Vacaville outlined restrictions they want in place for battery plants before more potentially come to town under state approval.\n\n\"I think we have an obligation to make sure Vacaville is not the next Moss Landing. That's a critical point right now,\" said another neighbor who was met with a roar of applause from neighbors in the audience.\n\nIn January, a massive fire erupted at the Moss Landing Vistra Power lithium-ion battery facility in Monterey County, prompting local evacuations.\n\nThe same facility caught fire again a month later.\n\nNeighbors worry that with these plants proposed for Vacaville and Solano County, it's only a matter of time before they cause a wind-fueled, challenging-to-extinguish fire.\n\n\"From every incident that happens across the country, we are learning from every one of those, poring over the after-action reports,\" said Chief Kris Concepcion of the Vacaville Fire Department.\n\nConcepcion says safety is their top priority, but it's not yet possible for them to put together an emergency plan until they know exactly what is coming to Vacaville and when.\n\n\"Before any project comes in here we are gonna monitor very closely and take a look at it and make sure we have a good emergency response plan,\" said Concepcion.\n\nNeighbors fear their home values will go down and their cost of living will go up.\n\n\"I don't want to breathe it, I don't want to see fires, and I don't want to pay triple my home insurance,\" said one neighbor in public comment.\n\nSome neighbors say projects like this could drive them from Vacaville altogether.\n\n\"If things like this pass, we absolutely would sell our home and move,\" a young mother commented, who loves near the proposed Corby Project.\n\nSome suggestions from neighbors on Wednesday night for the ordinance included that these plants should be at least a mile from homes. Right now, the city is suggesting a 300-foot buffer.\n\nOthers said the city should ban lithium-ion batteries altogether, forcing the companies to use what they say are safer energy alternatives. Many also want the sites to sit only in industrial parks, not on farmland.\n\nThe city expects to publish a draft of its ordinance in November.\n\nFor updates on upcoming meetings and proposed facilities, visit the city's web page on BESS projects.",

        "title": "Plans underway for Border Patrol immigration crackdown in San Francisco area, sources say",
        "description": "Camilo Montoya-Galvez is the immigration reporter at CBS News. Based in Washington, he covers immigration policy and politics.\n\nThe Trump administration has made preparations to expand its nationwide crackdown on illegal immigration in the San Francisco area with a team of Border Patrol agents, two U.S. officials familiar with the internal plans told CBS News on Wednesday.\n\nThe officials, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the media, said Border Patrol's operations in the Northern California area could start as early as later this week, but that the timing could shift.\n\nOne of the U.S. officials said the Border Patrol agents would stage at the U.S. Coast Guard base in Alameda, roughly 15 miles from San Francisco. That plan was reported earlier Wednesday by The San Francisco Chronicle. The Department of Homeland Security oversees Border Patrol, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the U.S. Coast Guard.\n\nThe U.S. officials said Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino, one of the most visible faces of the Trump administration's immigration crackdown, is expected to be involved in the operation. Bovino is currently leading Border Patrol arrests in Chicago, where a judge on Monday ordered him to answer questions about agents' use of force during those operations. He also oversaw the agency's controversial immigration raids in the Los Angeles area this summer.\n\nIn a response to CBS News' request for comment, a spokesperson for DHS said, \"DHS is targeting the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens-including murderers, rapists, gang members, pedophiles, and terrorists-in cities such as Portland, Chicago, Memphis and San Francisco. As it does every day, DHS law enforcement will enforce the laws of our nation.\"\n\nIn a video posted on social media Wednesday, California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, denounced the Trump administration's plans, accusing the president of seeking to create \"conditions for anxiety\" in American cities.\n\n\"He sends out masked men, he sends out Border Patrol. He sends out ICE, creates anxiety and fear in the community, so that he can lay claim to solving for that by sending in the Guard in the first place,\" Newsom said.\n\nPresident Trump has recently floated the idea of dispatching federal agents to San Francisco.\n\n\"We're going to go to San Francisco. The difference is I think they want us in San Francisco,\" Mr. Trump said in a Fox News interview that aired over the weekend.\n\nOn Wednesday, San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie said local residents would protest peacefully if the Trump administration uses \"un-American tactics to target immigrant communities\" in the area.\n\n\"This federal administration wants to divide us, but we know San Francisco is strongest when we come together to stand up for each other and our values,\" Lurie added.\n\nAs part of an aggressive expansion in deportation efforts across the country, the Trump administration has deployed teams of Border Patrol agents to large, Democratic-led American cities far away from a U.S. border.\n\nAs federal immigration officers, Border Patrol agents have the legal authority to arrest individuals suspected of being in the U.S. illegally anywhere in the country. However, they have expanded search powers in areas close to a coastal or land border.\n\nIn recent weeks, Border Patrol has been carrying out immigration arrests throughout the Chicago area, sometimes as part of operations at worksites and public places that have garnered local backlash. Earlier in the year, Border Patrol launched a similar campaign in the Los Angeles area, arresting suspected unauthorized immigrants in Home Depot parking lots, car washes and other locations.",

        "title": "San Francisco mayor says city is preparing for a possible ICE surge",
        "description": "San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie (D) speaks during a Domestic Violence Awareness Month rally on Oct. 21. (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)\n\nSan Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie on Wednesday announced emergency actions ahead of an anticipated escalation in federal immigration enforcement, warning that the Trump administration aims to provoke \"backlash, chaos and violence\" in American cities.\n\nIn a live video address, Lurie (D) said he had signed an executive directive to ensure that local police abide by \"sanctuary city\" policies that prohibit them from assisting in civil immigration and respect the free speech of residents who protest the Trump administration's actions.\n\nThe mayor's remarks came as President Donald Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi L. Noem have vowed in recent weeks to make San Francisco the next target in the administration's immigration crackdown, following major operations in other Democratic-led cities, including Los Angeles, Washington, Boston and Chicago.\n\nThe San Francisco Chronicle reported that more than 100 federal agents, including from U.S. Customs and Border Protection, will begin arriving Thursday to Coast Guard Base Alameda, a move viewed as a prelude to the possible deployment of National Guard troops.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) said this week that the state would sue the Trump administration if the president attempts to direct National Guard troops into San Francisco.\n\nSkip to end of carousel\n\nICE increasingly targets undocumented migrants with no criminal record\n\nThe Trump administration is increasingly targeting unauthorized immigrants with no criminal record as it ramps up arrests, a Washington Post analysis of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement data shows.\n\nEnd of carousel\n\n\"We don't exactly know what the federal government is planning. But we do know this federal administration has a playbook, in cities across the country: Masked immigration officials are deployed to use aggressive enforcement tactics that instill fear,\" Lurie said.\n\nThe Trump administration, he said, aims to provoke a violent reaction from local communities that is \"then used as an excuse to deploy military personnel.\"\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security did not respond directly when asked for comment about potential immigration enforcement actions in San Francisco. The agency issued a statement that it is \"targeting the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens -- including murderers, rapists, gang members, pedophiles, and terrorists -- in cities such as Portland, Chicago, Memphis and San Francisco. As it does every day, DHS law enforcement will enforce the laws of our nation.\"\n\nSan Francisco is one of the nation's longest-standing sanctuary jurisdictions, having approved policies in 1989 that limit local cooperation with civil immigration enforcement. Former city leaders, including Newsom, who served as mayor, and Kamala Harris, a onetime San Francisco city attorney, have used their positions to vault into national prominence, with both of them viewed as potential 2028 presidential candidates.\n\nLurie, flanked by City Attorney David Chiu, interim police chief Paul Yep and other officials, sought to portray San Francisco as a city that has made significant strides in reducing violent crime and homeless encampments, mitigating the need for federal intervention.\n\nRather, he said, a surge of federal law enforcement would make residents feel unsafe and \"hinder our progress and let chaos get in the way of our recovery. This doesn't make our city safer. It terrorizes our community.\"\n\nLurie did not mention Trump by name during his remarks. Since taking office, he has sought to avoid directly antagonizing the president, a strategy that has engendered criticism from some civil rights groups who say he has not been forceful enough.\n\nThe mayor met with several dozen civic leaders after his video address to personally brief them on his plans.\n\n\"I was excited that the mayor continues to bring everyone together and there was palpable energy to resist the unlawful military actions of the federal administration,\" said Vincent Pan, co-executive director for Chinese for Affirmative Action, a San Francisco-based social justice organization. Pan called on residents, government officials and local business leaders \"to be more courageous and creative in our leadership than we ever have before.\"\n\nIn his public remarks, Lurie encouraged residents to protest the administration's actions but cautioned them to do so nonviolently.\n\n\"I want to be crystal clear: Violent behavior toward officers or destructive behavior toward local businesses will not be tolerated,\" Lurie said. \"If federal officials come to incite chaos on the streets of San Francisco, the way to support our communities and keep everyone in our city safe is to make our voices heard peacefully. Violence and destruction will only open the door to a more aggressive response and that puts our communities at greater risk.\"",

        "title": "San Francisco mayor announces executive order to coordinate city response to CBP deployment",
        "description": "Carlos E. Casta\u00f1eda is a senior editor of news and social media for CBS Bay Area.\n\nSan Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie announced Wednesday he has directed city officials and departments to coordinate the city's response to any federal law enforcement action in the city.\n\nThe executive directive is designed to coordinate public safety and communication procedures, and support the city's immigrant communities, while maintaining trust between residents and city government, Lurie said. He announced the directive following word on Wednesday that more than 100 U.S. Customs and Border Patrol agents were being deployed to Coast Guard Base Alameda in an apparent escalation of federal immigration enforcement in the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\nLurie's directive includes the activation of an Incident Coordination Call by the city's Department of Emergency Management to coordinate response and information sharing among city departments. In addition, the order directs the City Attorney's Office to monitor developments and pursue legal action against the Trump administration when necessary, and to include the San Francisco Unified School District in interdepartmental coordination to support immigrant students and families.\n\n\"We have longstanding sanctuary policies in our city that prohibit local law enforcement from assisting federal immigration enforcement,\" said Lurie. \"Those policies help build trust between police and communities, and they help keep people comfortable reporting crimes ... We can't prevent federal officials from enforcing immigration laws, but we're going to keep our local law enforcement focused on ensuring your safety.\"\n\nThere was no immediate word on what type of operations the CBP agents would be carrying out. CBS News Bay Area has reached out to CBP for more information on the mission. Two U.S. officials told CBS News that Border Patrol official Gregory Bovino is expected to be involved in the operation. He's currently leading Border Patrol arrests in Chicago, and oversaw the agency's controversial raids in Southern California this summer.\n\nCBP is the largest federal law enforcement agency of the Department of Homeland Security and is the country's primary border control organization.\n\nThe Alameda Police Department released a statement on Wednesday saying it was not a part of the operation, and that the department does not enforce federal immigration laws or related civil warrants. Alameda police also urged people to avoid interaction with federal law enforcement and referred residents to the city's website for resources and information on immigrants' rights.\n\nOakland Mayor Barbara Lee issued a statement Wednesday, saying the city was actively monitoring the situation.\n\n\"Oakland remains a proud sanctuary city committed to standing with our immigrant families, \" said Lee. \"We will notify our community with as much information as possible about any federal deployment. Real public safety comes from Oakland-based solutions, not federal military occupation.\"\n\nThe developments come on the same day Gov. Gavin Newsom announced he would deploy the state National Guard to help staff food banks amid the ongoing government shutdown. Newsom said the National Guard would not be acting as law enforcement during the mission, mirroring his deployment of the Guard in the early days of the COVID pandemic, also in support of food banks.\n\nOn Sunday, President Trump reiterated his pledge to send National Guard troops to San Francisco, on the heels of his deployments of Guard troops to Portland, Chicago and Los Angeles. Newsom and California Attorney General Rob Bonta have vowed to immediately file suit against the Trump administration should Mr. Trump send federalized National Guard troops into the city.\n\nTrump has argued that troop deployments to U.S. cities are necessary because of what he characterizes as high levels of crime and unrest, as well as shielding federal agents from attacks during immigration enforcement operations. California, Illinois and Oregon have sued the Trump administration over the deployments, arguing they are politically motivated and violate state sovereignty, that there is no insurrection to justify them, and they violate the Posse Comitatus Act, which prohibits using the U.S. military to enforce domestic laws except where expressly authorized by Congress.",

        "title": "Democrats' shutdown shakedown harms air-traffic controllers  --  and...",
        "description": "Democrats on Capitol Hill continue to hold the federal government hostage, bowing to the demands of their leftist base.\n\nSince Oct. 1, Senate Democrats have voted 12 times to thwart a budget extension that would reopen the government, demanding a $1.5 trillion ransom for their pet projects.\n\nTo keep their allies in line, George Soros-backed radicals staged a nationwide block party Saturday, protesting against a supposed \"king.\"\n\nTheir Hate America rallies had everything -- a teacher mocking Charlie Kirk's assassination, overt references to murdering President Donald Trump, demands for ICE agents to be \"shot and wiped out,\" even a topless purple-haired woman brandishing a \"Free Luigi, Jail Trump\" sign.\n\nWhile Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries scramble to placate their base, our air traffic controllers are now in their fourth week of paycheck anxiety.\n\nIf the Schumer-Jefferies shakedown continues past Tuesday, controllers will miss their full paychecks next week, after getting partial ones on Oct. 14.\n\nAs Transportation secretary, nothing is more abhorrent to me than messing with the livelihoods of these patriotic men and women -- all for the sake of health care for illegal immigrants.\n\nI've visited with controllers over the last few weeks at Newark Liberty and Baltimore International, and the stress this shakedown is putting on them is real.\n\nThey're already working overtime, managing the most complex airspace in America with outdated, dilapidated equipment -- and now Democrats are forcing them to worry whether they can pay their bills on time.\n\nMany are furious: Why are legislators putting illegal immigrants' needs before their own?\n\nOthers tell me they're on the brink of taking on odd jobs -- driving for Uber, delivering for DoorDash -- just to make sure they can put food on the table.\n\nLet me be clear: American air travel is safe, even as the government remains shut down.\n\nThe vast majority of our dedicated air traffic controllers continue to come to work six days a week, despite the uncertainty of their next paycheck.\n\nWhile we've recently seen a slight increase in the number of controllers calling out sick, the Federal Aviation Administration will not permit planes to fly if the airspace is unsafe.\n\nBut the position Democrats are putting them is wrong, and it will exacerbate the challenges facing our airspace today.\n\nMore controller shortages will mean long airport lines, delayed flights, cancelled trips and increasing disruptions for the flying public.\n\nWorse yet, the shakedown isn't just hurting staffing today in our towers -- it discourages the next generation of controllers from pursuing this critical but demanding career.\n\nAt our FAA Academy, I'm hearing of candidates who are hesitant to attend, worried that future government shutdowns will threaten pay stability once they begin their careers.\n\nAdditionally, some current students are reluctant to complete their training, knowing that if they're assigned to a facility, they'll have to begin work without pay.\n\nThe longer this limbo drags on, the less attractive this career path and compensation will appear to future recruits.\n\nThis threatens to destroy months of hard-fought progress we've made to erase a nationwide shortage of controllers.\n\nThe FAA was previously on track to hire 8,900 new controllers through 2028, and my agency exceeded its goal of 2,000 new recruits for the 2025 fiscal year, bringing 2,026 into the Academy.\n\nThat's 20% higher than Pete Buttigieg's total for the same period in 2024 -- but every day the shakedown continues is another day of discouragement for the American patriots who we'll need to keep our skies safe.\n\nSchumer and Jefferies see no problem with any of this.\n\n\"Every day gets better for us,\" the senator said weeks ago, as top Democrats pledged to keep the government closed until there are \"planes falling out of the sky.\"\n\nDemocratic Govs. Wes Moore of Maryland and Gavin Newsom of California even had the audacity to blame the president and me for the budget impasse -- ignoring that their own party is the one rejecting the clean funding bill Republicans have already approved.\n\nHere's the bottom line: Our runway to fixing our skies and launching a golden age of air travel is being blocked by Congressional Democrats' refusal to fund the government.\n\nAnd more planes will be grounded as Democrats continue their reckless, risky taxpayer shakedown.",

        "title": "California National Guard to support food banks due to expected food assistance delays",
        "description": "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- California Gov. Gavin Newsom said Wednesday he will deploy National Guard troops to support food banks in November, a move that comes in light of anticipated delays to federal food assistance amid the government shutdown.\n\nAbout 40 million low-income people across the U.S., including roughly 5.5 million in California, receive federal food assistance through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, formerly known as food stamps. But Newsom, a Democrat, warned families should expect an interruption to those benefits next month.\n\n\"This is serious, this is urgent - and requires immediate action,\" he said.\n\nThat's a starkly different mission from President Donald Trump's deployment of California National Guard troops to guard federal buildings and immigration agents in Southern California as part of his mass deportation agenda. He's also deployed or tried to send guard troops to Chicago, Washington, D.C., and Portland, Oregon.\n\nNewsom, Trump's longtime political rival, has fought the president's deployment of troops to Democrat-run cities, saying last month that Trump can't \"trample a state's power to protect its people.\" A federal appeals court heard arguments Wednesday on Trump's deployment of troops to Los Angeles. A lower court judge ruled that the federal government violated federal law.\n\nNewsom said he's fast-tracking $80 million for food banks in nearly every county in the state.\n\nThe governor's office said he's building off of his efforts to combat food insecurity during the COVID-19 pandemic. Newsom ordered the National Guard and volunteers from a state-run program in 2020 to work with food banks across the state to identify needs. Troops helped pack and deliver 800 million meals to people, Newsom's office said. The governor will share additional details on the new effort as Nov. 1 approaches.\n\nTrump's big tax breaks and spending cuts law also set new rules for the federal program also known as SNAP, requiring more people to work to receive food assistance.\n\nThe California Immigrant Policy Center is concerned that Newsom's plan could inadvertently have a chilling effect due to Trump's National Guard deployments, said Josh Stehlik, the advocacy group's policy director. But Stehlik was pleased to see the governor say that guard would not be acting as law enforcement.\n\n\"It makes sense to mobilize the National Guard for the humanitarian purpose of delivering much needed and critical food assistance to people during an emergency that's been caused by the federal government shutdown,\" Stehlik said.\n\nVolunteers through a state-run program will also provide support to food banks.\n\n\"During this critical time as DC strips communities of vital resources, Californians are doing what we always do - which is step up for each other,\" said Josh Fryday, director of the Governor's Office of Service and Community Engagement, which oversees the program.",

        "title": "With Supreme Court decision still pending, judge extends block on Guard in Chicago indefinitely",
        "description": "CHICAGO -- National Guard troops won't be deploying in the Chicago area anytime soon unless the U.S. Supreme Court intervenes because a judge on Wednesday extended her temporary restraining order indefinitely.\n\nElsewhere around the country, it will be at least days before the Guard could be deployed in Portland, Oregon, and federal appeals judges are weighing whether hundreds of California National Guard members should remain under federal control.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's push to send the military into Democratic-run cities despite fierce resistance from mayors and governors has unleashed a whirlwind of lawsuits and overlapping court rulings.\n\nHere's what to know about legal efforts to block or deploy the National Guard in various cities:\n\nU.S. District Judge April Perry on Wednesday blocked the deployment of Guard troops to the Chicago area until the case has been decided either in her court or the U.S. Supreme Court intervenes. Perry had already blocked the deployment for two weeks through a temporary restraining order, or TRO.\n\nAttorneys representing the federal government said they would agree to extend the order but emphasized that they would continue pressing for an emergency order from the Supreme Court that would allow for the deployment.\n\nPHOTOS: With Supreme Court decision still pending, judge extends block on Guard in Chicago indefinitely\n\n\"Every day this improper TRO remains in effect imposes grievous and irreparable harm on the Executive,\" Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in a Supreme Court filing Tuesday.\n\nLawyers representing Chicago and Illinois have asked the Supreme Court to continue to block the deployment, calling it a \"dramatic step.\"\n\nAn appeals court said Monday that Trump could take command of 200 Oregon National Guard troops, but a separate court order still blocks him from actually deploying them.\n\nU.S. District Judge Karin Immergut, a Trump appointee, issued two temporary restraining orders earlier this month. One prohibited Trump from calling up Oregon troops so he could send them to Portland. The other prohibited him from sending any Guard members to Oregon at all after he tried to evade the first order by deploying California troops instead.\n\nThe Justice Department appealed the first order and - in a 2-1 ruling Monday - a 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel sided with the administration.\n\nHowever, Immergut's second order remains in effect, so no troops may immediately be deployed. She has scheduled a hearing for Friday on the administration's request to dissolve that order. Meanwhile, the state is asking the 9th Circuit to reconsider Monday's ruling.\n\nA 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel in Pasadena heard arguments Wednesday related to Trump's deployment of Guard troops to Los Angeles.\n\nA district court found the administration violated federal law when it sent troops to Los Angeles in June after protests over Trump's immigration crackdown.\n\nJudge Charles Breyer handed California Gov. Gavin Newsom a victory on June 13 when he ordered control of California's Guard members back to the state. But in an emergency ruling, an appeals court panel sided with the Trump administration, putting Breyer's decision on hold and allowing the troops to remain in federal hands as the lawsuit unfolds.\n\nThe appeals court is now weighing whether to vacate Breyer's June order.\n\nThe same three-judge panel is also handling the Trump administration's appeal of Breyer's Sept. 2 ruling, which found the president violated the Posse Comitatus Act, an 1878 law prohibiting military enforcement of domestic laws.\n\nIn Charleston, West Virginia, a state court hearing is set for Friday in a lawsuit filed by two groups seeking to block deployment of the state National Guard to Washington, D.C. More than 300 Guard members have been in the nation's capital supporting Trump's initiative since late August.\n\nA separate federal court hearing centers on a request by District of Columbia Attorney General Brian Scwalb for a temporary injunction to stop the deployments of more than 2,000 guardsmen.\n\nForty-five states have entered filings in that case, with 23 supporting the administration's actions in D.C. and 22 supporting the attorney general's lawsuit.\n\nRepublican governors from several states also sent units to D.C. Although the emergency period ended in September, more than 2,200 troops remain. Several states told The Associated Press they would bring their units home by Nov. 30, unless extended.\n\nIn Tennessee, Democratic elected officials sued last Friday to stop the ongoing Guard deployment in Memphis. They said Republican Gov. Bill Lee, acting on a request from Trump, violated the state constitution, which says the Guard can be called up during \"rebellion or invasion\" - but only with state lawmakers' blessing.\n\nSince their arrival on Oct. 10, troops have been patrolling downtown Memphis, including near the iconic Pyramid, wearing fatigues and protective vests that say \"military police,\" with guns in holsters. Guard members have no arrest power, officials have said.\n\n___\n\nJohnson reported from Seattle. Associated Press writers Mark Sherman in Washington, D.C., Olga R. Rodr\u00edguez in San Francisco, Adrian Sainz in Memphis, and John Raby in Charleston, West Virginia contributed to this report.",

Each week, Jen dives into the key players, emerging issues and strategic movements shaping the future of the Democratic Party. Subscribe now to get her insights delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nA few months ago, it looked like Republicans' attempts to gerrymander their way into a House majority might not be as successful as they had hoped.\n\nAfter Texas Republicans passed their own maps to squeeze out more GOP seats in a controversial mid-decade redistricting effort, California Gov. Gavin Newsom proposed Prop. 50, a ballot measure to redraw its districts.\n\nIt looked like the two maps would cancel each other out. But Republicans have since ramped up their redistricting efforts.\n\nThe Republican House and Senate in North Carolina have approved new maps that dismantle the state's only competitive district, currently held by Democratic Rep. Don Davis -- one of three Black members of Congress from the state. The maps could formally pass at any time.\n\nThe maps are likely to be challenged in court as a violation of the Voting Rights Act but the Supreme Court appears to be leaning toward limiting the ability of lawmakers to use race as a factor in redistricting, even when it is done to prevent discrimination.\n\nThat's just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nEach of these gerrymanders gives Republicans one or two more seats, potentially giving them a lock on the House majority even if more Americans vote for a Democratic candidate.\n\nHouse Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries knows this. And he has recently stepped up his own push with recent meetings in both Illinois and Maryland with leaders about possible redistricting efforts.\n\nEven if Californians approve their counter-gerrymander this November, that won't be enough.\n\nMore blue states will need to take action -- and soon. Where Democratic governors have the option to redraw their maps, they will need to start moving forward now.\n\nNo one likes gerrymandering, but Republicans have chosen to play by a different set of rules. Democrats can't afford to take the high road here.\n\n\"I feel so helpless as a senior who recently retired. How can I find hope in a world that feels hopeless?\"\n\nI get it! Some days I flip through the news and it feels pretty downright depressing. But what gives me hope is when I see neighbors standing up for each other in the face of immigration raids, when I see millions of Americans marching peacefully at last weekend's No Kings protests and when I see candidates put their hat in the ring to run for office who have never been involved in politics before. Moments like this can feel overwhelming. But every action you take inspires others to stand up, and when enough people join together, anything is possible. So no matter how dispirited you feel, take the time to write five letters to members of Congress or spend 5 minutes talking to a neighbor about what's going on with the government shutdown. Do what you can, and know that whatever you do will play a part in making change happen.\n\nEvery week, Jen selects a question to answer from a newsletter subscriber.

        "title": "Fight over new US House districts in California could turn on advertising edge in closing days",
        "description": "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Less than two weeks from Election Day, the fight over new California U.S. House maps that could erase up to five Republican seats is starting to look like a lopsided match-up, with opponents running low on campaign ads and options.\n\nThe dynamics of the race can still change, and ballot questions have a history of quirky outcomes in California. But industry data show TV advertising spending -- the main pipeline to voters in the vast state -- dropping off dramatically by Republicans and other critics of the proposal.\n\nThe map pushed by Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom aims to bolster his party's chances of regaining a House majority in 2026 and counter Republican efforts to add more seats in Texas and other states.\n\nVoting began earlier this month and concludes Nov. 4.\n\nOver 1.5 million Democratic mail ballots have been returned so far, outpacing about 853,000 Republican ballots, though that's not surprising in a state where registered Democrats outnumber GOP voters by nearly 2-to-1.\n\nData compiled by advertising tracker AdImpact show Democrats and other supporters have nearly $9 million in ad buys booked on broadcast TV, cable and radio. But opponents have virtually no time reserved, though the data don't include some popular streaming services like Hulu and YouTube or mail advertising.\n\nAccording to AdImpact, supporters have aired nearly $70 million in ads so far, compared to about $31 million from opponents.\n\nThe outcome of the fight over so-called Proposition 50 will have national implications. A Democratic House would menace President Donald Trump's agenda for the remainder of his term, while Newsom is widely seen as a likely 2028 presidential contender who would get a publicity boost within his party for spearheading a plan to sidetrack Trump's conservative playbook.\n\n\"If we lose this election in California it means Democrats have virtually no chance of taking back the House,\" Newsom warned in a recent fundraising pitch to supporters.\n\nEarlier in the campaign the Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC tied to House Speaker Mike Johnson, kicked in a $5 million donation to opponents. But conspicuously, a hoped-for late surge in national Republican dollars has yet to materialize.\n\nInvesting in heavily Democratic California is often seen as a dicey bet for GOP donors, and Republicans are fighting across the country to hold their slim majorities in the House and Senate next year. Trump has mostly kept a distance from the contest in a state he lost in landslides in three presidential elections, but where he also has a loyal conservative base and received more votes than any previous Republican presidential candidate.\n\nCalifornia is home to some of the nation's most expensive media markets. When it comes to money, it's not just a matter of fighting off Newsom's new House map for the GOP -- tens of millions of dollars more will be needed to defend the dwindling number of Republican House incumbents in the state, whether Proposition 50 passes or not.\n\nWith the 2026 midterms approaching and House control on the line, national Republican donors \"are looking at those dollars and thinking where are they needed the most,\" said Tim Lineberger, who was communications director for Trump's 2016 campaign in Michigan and also worked in the former president's administration. With critical House races emerging around the country, those dollars might go elsewhere \"rather than fight what might be inevitable here.\"\n\nBut with millions of Trump voters in California \"it's still an important fight to have in this state,\" Lineberger added.\n\nLongtime Republican strategist Jon Fleishman, a former executive director of the California Republican Party, asked, \"Does the road to the White House or the Senate or the House really run through California?\"\n\n\"If we are not seeing a lot of national money coming in, we may be getting an unfortunate answer to that question,\" Fleishman said.\n\nHow much California's political maneuvering will matter in House control -- even if the new map is approved next month -- is not yet known.\n\nThe proposed California House districts -- crafted by Democrats behind closed doors -- have been designed to add five Democratic U.S. House seats to offset Trump's moves in Texas to gain five Republican districts before the 2026 midterm elections. That could boost the Democratic margin to 48 of California's 52 congressional seats, up from the 43 seats the party now holds.\n\nBut Republicans in Missouri, North Carolina and Indiana are making moves that could add GOP House seats as well -- districts are crafted state by state. Republicans hold a 219-213 majority in the U.S. House, with three vacancies.\n\nThe framework of the race is set, with Newsom depicting the contest as a battle against Trump to save democracy, while Republicans and their supporters decry the proposal as a blatant power grab intended to make the state's dominant Democrats even more powerful while discarding House maps developed by an independent commission.\n\nA handful of Republican congressmen who could see their districts dramatically reshaped have mostly stayed away from the campaign spotlight.\n\nThe single largest donor in the campaign could probably walk through downtown Los Angeles in the middle of the day without getting recognized. Charles Munger Jr. -- son of the late billionaire Charlie Munger, who helped Warren Buffett build Berkshire Hathaway into an investment powerhouse -- has funneled over $30 million into the effort to block Newsom's plan.\n\nMunger, a longtime Republican donor who was instrumental in establishing independent redistricting in the state, says voters need to put aside talk of Trump and look at how Newsom's map would upend representation by carving up districts for political gain.\n\nVoters should ask, \"Is this good for you?\" Munger told reporters recently. \"Do you want to trust these people who drew these maps this way?\"\n\nThe campaign has lured some marquee names -- former Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger has appeared in ads opposing the change, while former Democratic President Barack Obama has endorsed Newsom's proposal. But without a candidate on the ballot, the race has lacked for gripping drama.\n\nTo surpass the 50% mark and win, Newsom and his supporters are hoping to keep the focus on Trump, with the intent of driving up a large turnout of Democratic and other left-leaning voters. Because Republicans make up only 1-in-4 voters in the state, opponents will need to get a heroic GOP turnout while peeling off a slice of Democrats as well as getting an edge with independent voters.\n\nAt a rally last week in suburban Los Angeles opposing the proposal, Republican retiree Anne White lamented that the plan would in some cases create oddly shaped districts that would combine rural and farming areas than tend to lean Republican with liberal coastal cities.\n\n\"Those people have nothing in common with one another,\" White said. While the current districts were established by an independent commission in public hearings, Newsom \"wants to undo all of that.\"",

        "description": "Ron Gochez, a teacher at a local high school, criticized ICE raids in and around the city.\n\nA Los Angeles high school history teacher who serves as a spokesperson for a local anti-ICE activist group appeared to welcome armed resistance against immigration authorities after a federal agent and an illegal immigrant were shot hours earlier.\n\nRon Gochez, a teacher at Dr. Maya Angelou Community High School and a spokesperson for Union Del Barrio, spoke during a news conference Tuesday night where he criticized U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents.\n\n\"Don't forget where you're standing -- this is South Central Los Angeles,\" he said. \"They [ICE] are not the only ones with guns in this city. Don't forget that. And I don't say that because I'm calling for violence; I'm saying that because the people have every right to defend themselves against masked, unidentified gunmen.\"\n\nMSNBC REPORTER SUGGESTS ICE CREATED FEAR, DIVISION BY MASKING UP AND USING UNMARKED CARS PRIOR TO SHOOTING\n\n\"The people have every right to defend themselves,\" he added. \"That's not violent, that's intelligent.\"\n\nFox News Digital has reached out to Gochez, the Los Angeles Unified School District, Union Del Barrio, the Department of Homeland Security, and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\nCalifornia officials have pushed to block authorities from wearing masks during immigration enforcement operations. In September, Gov. Gavin Newsom signed legislation to ban state and federal law enforcement from wearing masks on the job, a move that the Trump administration decried as illegal and vowed to ignore.\n\nThe bill is set to take effect in January.\n\nGochez's remarks came hours after a U.S. marshal and an illegal immigrant were shot during an enforcement operation.\n\nThe suspect, identified as Carlitos Ricardo Parias, 44, of Mexico, allegedly rammed his vehicle into federal vehicles before agents opened fire. One federal agent was struck in the hand, and Parias was hit in the elbow. Both were struck by bullets fired by a federal agent, authorities said.\n\n5 TIMES DEMOCRATS BLASTED ICE WITH HARSH RHETORIC\n\nFederal prosecutors said Parias used a Toyota Camry to strike law enforcement vehicles in front of and behind him, spinning his tires and fishtailing in an attempt to escape, prompting concerns for officer safety. Parias is also known as \"Richard L.A.,\" a TikTok influencer, Fox Los Angeles reported.\n\nHe and the injured law enforcement officer were taken to a hospital. Protesters were seen shouting at hospital staffers as both were being treated for their injuries.\n\nDHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin blamed officials in sanctuary jurisdictions for brazen attacks against immigration authorities in recent months.\n\n\"These are the consequences of conduct and rhetoric by sanctuary politicians and activists who urge illegal aliens to resist arrest. Resisting arrest puts the safety of illegal aliens, law enforcement, and the public at risk,\" she said in a statement to Fox News Digital.\n\n\"Our law enforcement officers are facing a more than 1,000% increase in assaults against them, including vehicle rammings by illegal aliens,\" she added. \"We are once again calling on sanctuary politicians, agitators, and the media to turn the temperature down and stop calling for violence and resistance against ICE law enforcement.\"\n\nDuring Tuesday's news conference, Gochez accused federal authorities of using \"brutal violence\" and \"repression\" against immigrant communities in Los Angeles.\n\n\"It's not enough for them to kidnap our people, now we are seeing on multiple occasions... that they are shooing us with live rounds,\" he said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIn March, Gochez was named the winner of the Cesar E. Chavez and Dolores Huerta \"Si Se Puede\" Human Rights Award by the California Teachers Association.\n\n\"He has been a steadfast advocate of immigrant families, taking bold steps to shield his community from the threat of ICE raids,\" the CTA said in a news release at the time. \"Gochez excels in promoting solidarity among Black and brown communities, recognizing their shared struggles. Through community engagement initiatives, he cultivates understanding and respect, empowering students to celebrate differences while uniting for common goals.\"",

        "title": "Trump-backed North Carolina House map approved by lawmakers as Republicans aim to pick up seat",
        "description": "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.\n\nNorth Carolina Republican legislative leaders completed their remapping of the state's U.S. House districts on Wednesday, intent on picking up one more seat to help President Donald Trump's efforts to retain GOP control of Congress in next year's midterm elections.\n\nThe new boundaries approved by the state House could thwart the reelection of Democratic U.S. Rep. Don Davis, who currently represents more than 20 northeastern counties. The state Senate already approved the plan in a party-line vote on Tuesday.\n\nRepublicans hold majorities in both General Assembly chambers, and Democratic Gov. Josh Stein is unable under state law to use his veto stamp on redistricting maps. So the GOP's proposal can now be implemented unless likely litigation by Democrats or voting rights advocates stops it. Candidate filing for 2026 is scheduled to begin Dec. 1.\n\nRepublican lawmakers made the intent of their proposed changes crystal clear -- it's an attempt to satisfy Trump's call for GOP-led states to secure more seats for the party nationwide, so that Congress can continue advancing his agenda. Democrats have responded with rival moves in blue states. A president's party historically loses seats in midterm elections, and Democrats currently need just three more seats to flip House control.\n\nTRUMP'S REDISTRICTING PUSH GAINS STEAM IN ANOTHER KEY STATE: 'WE WILL STAND WITH THE PRESIDENT'\n\n\"The new congressional map improves Republican political strength in eastern North Carolina and will bring in an additional Republican seat to North Carolina's congressional delegation,\" GOP Rep. Brenden Jones said during a debate that Republicans cut off after an hour.\n\nDemocratic state Rep. Gloristine Brown, an African American who represents an eastern North Carolina county, made an impassioned floor speech in opposition, saying \"You are silencing Black voices and are going against the will of your constituents.\"\n\n\"North Carolina is a testing ground for the new era of Jim Crow laws,\" Brown said.\n\nTRUMP-BACKED CONGRESSIONAL MAP PASSES SENATE IN CRUCIAL MIDWESTERN STATE: 'COMMONSENSE VALUES'\n\nRepublican-led Texas and Missouri already have revised their U.S. House districts to try to help Republicans win additional seats. Democratic-led California reciprocated by asking the state's voters to approve a map revised to elect more Democrats, and Jones accused California Gov. Gavin Newsom of ramping up the redistricting fight.\n\n\"We will not let outsiders tell us how to govern, and we will never apologize for doing exactly what the people of this state has elected us to do,\" Jones said.\n\nNorth Carolina's replacement map would exchange several counties in Davis' current 1st District with another coastal district. Statewide election data suggests this would favor Republicans winning 11 of 14 House seats, up from the 10 they now hold, in a state where Trump got 51% of the popular vote in 2024.\n\nTRUMP-BACKED REDISTRICTING PUSH TURNS MIDWESTERN STATE INTO NEXT POLITICAL BATTLEGROUND\n\nDavis is one of North Carolina's three Black representatives. Map critics suggested this latest GOP map could be challenged as an illegal racial gerrymander in a district that has included several majority Black counties, electing African Americans to the U.S. House continuously since 1992.\n\nDavis is already vulnerable -- he won his second term by less than 2 percentage points, and the 1st District was one of 13 nationwide where both Trump and a Democratic House member was elected last year, according to the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia.\n\nDavis on Tuesday called the proposed map \"beyond the pale.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHundreds of Democratic and liberal activists swarmed the legislative complex this week, blasting GOP legislators for doing Trump's bidding with what they called a power grab through a speedy and unfair redistricting process.\n\n\"If you pass this, your legacy will be shredding the Constitution, destroying democracy,\" Karen Ziegler with the grassroots group Democracy Out Loud, told senators this week. She accused the state GOP of \"letting Donald Trump decide who represents the people of North Carolina.\"\n\nDemocrats said this map is a racial gerrymander that will dismantle decades of voting rights progress in North Carolina's \"Black Belt\" region. Republicans counter that no racial data was used in forming the districts, and the redrawing was based on political parties, not race.\n\nBased on last week's arguments before the U.S. Supreme Court in a Louisiana redistricting case, the Democrats may lose this line of attack. A majority of justices appears willing to neuter a key tool of the Voting Rights Act that has protected political boundaries created to help Black and Latino residents elect favored candidates, who have tended to be Democrats.\n\nState GOP leaders say Trump won North Carolina all three times that he's run for president -- albeit narrowly last year -- and thus merits more GOP support in Congress. Senate leader Phil Berger called it appropriate \"under the law and in conjunction with basically listening to the will of the people.\"",

        "title": "CBS News poll finds California Prop 50 support motivated by national focus, opposition to Trump",
        "description": "Kabir Khanna, Ph.D., is Director, Election Analytics & Technical Systems at CBS News. He analyzes elections and public opinion through survey research and data science tools. On election nights, he manages the team of experts responsible for projecting winners at the network Data Desk.\n\nIt's a state ballot measure about redistricting, but Proposition 50 has many California voters thinking nationally -- and a lot about President Trump.\n\nThose voting for it overwhelmingly say one reason is for them to oppose the Trump administration -- which they also feel generally treats California worse than other states -- and oppose national Republicans.\n\nOverall, those who see their Prop 50 vote as a national issue are backing it, and that rationale is in turn helping push the \"yes\" side of the measure into the lead.\n\nBy contrast, those who see it more as a state issue are opposed: Those voting \"no\" are driven by a concern that redistricting would shift power away from the state's rural areas and toward the cities and cost the state money. But their views are outnumbered at the moment.\n\nSome of Californians' views on President Trump are in turn driven by their widespread feeling that the administration treats California worse than other states. Only about a third say they're generally treated the same. (Even a quarter of Republicans, who overwhelmingly backed Trump in 2024, feel he treats the state worse than others.)\n\nIn all, and given those national dynamics voters express, it may be little surprise the measure has majority backing overall for the moment in the heavily-Democratic state.\n\nCalifornia's statewide debate on redistricting provides a unique look at a public perspective on the matter, while in many other states where it is being implemented or discussed, it is in the hands of legislatures and governors.\n\nIn sum, those who see it as a national issue are overwhelmingly backing it. Those seeing it more in state terms tend to be opposed.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom has a positive overall job approval from California voters, and is a net-positive for those who consider him a factor and are voting \"yes\" on Prop 50.\n\nHowever, he's even more of a motivating force for the \"no\" side, many of whom are Republicans, and half of whom say he's a reason for them to oppose it.\n\nThe potential dynamics of the proposed redistricting are seen to favor cities over both suburbs and rural areas -- perhaps a function of voters' views on proposed maps, or simply that more of California's Democrats live in and around its cities.\n\nThe argument made by opponents that it would cost the state money has gained some traction in the sense that four in 10 think it will, and it's a prevailing view on the \"no\" side. But that's not enough to sway the overall vote right now. A sizable number of those who think it'll cost money are still voting \"yes\" nonetheless.\n\nFinances, the deportation program, and President Trump\n\nOne reason Donald Trump may be drawing opposition -- besides a low statewide approval rating -- is that California's voters tend to feel his policies are making them financially worse off.\n\nAnd there is majority opposition to his deportation program, even more so than has been the case of late in the nation at large.\n\nThat said, Californians do see the administration's policies reducing the number of border crossings, specifically at California's section of the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nOn the deportation program, there are at least two reasons behind the sentiment: one, most California voters -- and especially those who disapprove of the program -- feel the administration is trying to deport more people than they'd expected.\n\nThe Californians who feel this way overwhelmingly voice opposition to the program. This connection has also been the case in recent months nationally. Hispanic voters, in particular, think the administration is deporting more than they'd expected and are slightly more disapproving of the program than White voters.\n\nThere is also opposition to the administration sending the National Guard to L.A.\n\nThe other factor is the prevailing view that the deportation program is making their local economies weaker. These views are often shaped by partisanship, but they also span areas from people living in both cities and smaller towns.\n\nThis is strongly connected to views of the program overall: those who see it weakening the local economy almost universally disapprove.\n\nMost of California's voters don't think the program is making their own communities safer. It's often a matter of partisanship behind that perception. Republicans say it is making their communities safer, but independents and Democrats do not.\n\nThis CBS News/YouGov survey was conducted with a representative sample of 1,504 registered voters in California interviewed between October 16-21, 2025. The sample was weighted according to gender, age, race, education, and geographic region based on the voter file and U.S. Census data, as well as to 2024 presidential vote. The margin of error is \u00b1 3.8 points for registered voters and \u00b1 3.6 points for likely voters.",

        "description": "The \"Inception\" star signs a petition that includes politicians, religious leaders and tech experts: \"Does anybody really want this?\"\n\nJoseph Gordon-Levitt has signed a growing petition calling for development of AI-powered superintelligence to cease until more is known about the technology and proper safeguards have been put in place to protect humanity.\n\nGordon-Levitt is one of the petition's 1,500-and-counting signatories, which also include numerous politicians, religious leaders and tech experts. Other entertainment figures, like Sir Stephen Fry, Will.I.am, Kate Bush, \"Everything Everywhere All At Once\" co-director Daniel Kwan and Elon Musk's former partner, Grimes, have all signed the petition as well.\n\nMusk himself is not one of the petition's signatories but he is quoted, along with other non-signatories like OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei, on the petition's list of statements proving why superintelligence poses a real threat to humanity.\n\n\"Why would you want to build an AI that's smarter than humans?\" Gordon-Levitt remarked in an X video announcing his involvement in the petition. \"You could say AI is going to cure diseases or AI is going to help strengthen our national security, and, yeah, I want those things, too. But why couldn't we just build an AI tool to help cure diseases or build an AI tool to help with national security? Why does it have to all be one big product that does everything?\"\n\n\"The answer is, of course, that's what will make more money,\" Gordon-Levitt continued. \"They want to build the product that will imitate a person, make you feel like it's your friend or your lover, seduce your kids, turn us all into slop junkies and make it hard to tell what's true or what's false and undermine democracy and, yeah, give rise to authoritarianism and make gajillions of dollars.\"\n\n\"Is that what we want?\" he mused. \"Because that's what these big tech companies are talking about when they talk about building superintelligence.\"\n\nGordon-Levitt has become an outspoken opponent of AI in recent months. He created a video op-ed in late September for the New York Times calling out Mark Zuckerberg, Meta's AI chatbots and the \"synthetic intimacy\" that said chatbots have created with unsuspecting minors online. \"It's hard to describe how angry this makes me,\" Gordon-Levitt said in the op-ed.\n\nIn October, Gordon-Levitt also publicly called out California Governor Gavin Newsom, accusing the politician of being \"too scared\" to sign a bill into law that would have created necessary regulations against AI.\n\nIt was additionally announced this month that Rachel McAdams had signed on to star in Gordon-Levitt's next directorial project, a thriller said to focus heavily on AI. Plot details about the film are being kept under wraps for the time being, but Gordon-Levitt co-wrote its script with Kieran Fitzgerald. Both share a \"story by\" credit on the project with Natasha Lyonne.\n\n\"Let's not build superintelligence until, No. 1, we can prove it's safe, and No. 2, the public actually wants it,\" Gordon-Levitt argued in his X video, in which he urged others who are concerned about the future of AI to sign the new petition, too. \"If you are concerned about the future these big tech companies are bringing to us, without permission, signing this petition is at least one small thing you could do.\"\n\nThe petition, titled a \"Statement on Superintelligence,\" states that AI companies' recent tech breakthroughs have \"raised concerns ranging from human economic obsolescence and disempowerment, losses of freedom, civil liberties, dignity, and control, to national security risks and even potential human extinction.\"",

        "title": "Judge agrees to extend block on Guard deployment in Chicago while awaiting Supreme Court ruling",
        "description": "CHICAGO -- CHICAGO (AP) -- President Donald Trump's attempts to deploy the military in Democratic-led cities -- over the objections of mayors and governors -- have brought a head-spinning array of court challenges and overlapping rulings.\n\nAs the U.S. Supreme Court ponders whether to clear the way for the National Guard in Chicago, a federal appeals court is hearing arguments in California Gov. Gavin Newsom's challenge to the deployment of troops in Los Angeles. Guard troops could also soon be on the ground in Portland, Oregon, pending legal developments there.\n\nHere's what to know about legal efforts to block or deploy the National Guard in various cities.\n\nA federal judge in Chicago already blocked deployment of Guard troops to the Chicago area for two weeks. On Wednesday, Judge April Perry agreed to extend that order by 30 days. But she said each party could discuss the extension further before meeting again at 3 p.m. local time, noting they would not be able to issue another one.\n\nStill, anything she does could be moot if the U.S. Supreme Court rules in the meantime.\n\nAttorneys representing the Trump administration said in court filings Tuesday that they would agree to possibly extend the block on deployment for 30 days. However, they are continuing to ask the U.S. Supreme Court to intervene. The Trump administration is pressing for an emergency order that would let Guard troops be deployed.\n\n\"Every day this improper TRO remains in effect imposes grievous and irreparable harm on the Executive,\" Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in a Supreme Court filing Tuesday.\n\nLawyers representing Chicago and Illinois have asked the Supreme Court to continue to block the deployment, calling it a \"dramatic step.\"\n\nAn appeals court said Monday that Trump could take command of 200 Oregon National Guard troops, but a separate court order still blocks him from actually deploying them.\n\nU.S. District Judge Karin Immergut, a Trump appointee, issued two temporary restraining orders earlier this month. One prohibited Trump from calling up the Oregon troops so he could send them to Portland. The other prohibited him from sending any Guard members to Oregon at all after he tried to evade the first order by deploying California troops instead.\n\nThe Justice Department appealed the first order, and in a 2-1 ruling Monday, a 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel sided with the administration.\n\nHowever, Immergut's second order remains in effect, so no troops may immediately be deployed.\n\nThe case is still before the courts.\n\nA 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel in Pasadena is set to hear arguments Wednesday related to Trump's deployment of Guard troops to Los Angeles.\n\nA district court found the administration violated federal law when it sent troops to Los Angeles in early June after protests over Trump's immigration crackdown.\n\nJudge Charles Breyer handed Newsom an early victory in the case on June 13 when he ordered control of California's Guard members back to the state. But in an emergency ruling, an appeals court panel sided with the Trump administration, allowing the troops to remain in federal hands as the lawsuit unfolds.\n\nThe appeals court will weigh whether to vacate Breyer's June order.\n\nThe same three-judge panel is also handling the Trump administration's appeal of a Sept. 2 ruling by Breyer, who found the president violated the Posse Comitatus Act, an 1878 law prohibiting military enforcement of domestic laws.\n\nIn Charleston, West Virginia, a state court hearing is set for Friday in a lawsuit filed by two groups seeking to block deployment of the state National Guard to Washington, D.C. More than 300 Guard members have been in the nation's capital supporting Trump's initiative since late August.\n\nA separate federal court hearing centers on a request by District of Columbia Attorney General Brian Scwalb for a temporary injunction to stop the deployments of more than 2,000 guardsmen.\n\nForty-five states have entered filings in that case, with 23 supporting the administration's actions in D.C. and 22 supporting the attorney general's lawsuit.\n\nRepublican governors from several states also sent units to D.C. Although the emergency period ended in September, more than 2,200 troops remain in the city. Several states told The Associated Press they would bring their units home by Nov. 30, unless extended.\n\nIn Tennessee, Democratic elected officials sued last Friday to stop the ongoing Guard deployment in Memphis. They said Republican Gov. Bill Lee, acting on a request from Trump, violated the state constitution, which says the Guard can be called up during \"rebellion or invasion\" -- but only with the blessing of state lawmakers.\n\nSince their arrival on Oct. 10, troops have been patrolling areas of downtown Memphis, including near the iconic Pyramid, wearing fatigues and protective vests that say \"military police,\" with guns in holsters. Guard members have no arrest power, officials have said.\n\n___\n\nJohnson reported from Seattle. Associated Press writers Mark Sherman in Washington, D.C., Olga R.

Gavin Newsom announced Wednesday that he will be deploying state National Guard members as well as California Volunteers to help staff food banks amid the ongoing government shutdown.\n\nNewsom said the action mirrors a step he took early in the COVID-19 pandemic when he also dispatched California National Guard members, again to support food banks.\n\nThe governor stated that the Guard troops won't be acting as law enforcement during the deployment.\n\n\"I'm expediting state funds for food banks and directing the California National Guard and California Volunteers to help distribute this food to families,\" Newsom stated.\n\nNewsom has been warning that the continued government shutdown could disrupt the CalFresh program, known federally as SNAP, which provides food benefits to around 5.5 million California residents.

        "description": "There are many stresses that come with being an LGBTQ+ youth: fear, isolation, bullying, feeling as if the world hates you, loved ones pressuring you to change.\n\nThose realities come into sharper view in the first release of findings from an ongoing study by the Trevor Project to track the mental health of about 1,700 youth across the U.S. over an extended period of time.\n\nResearchers from the West Hollywood, California-based nonprofit saw a sharp increase in mental distress among the participants. Over the course of one year, the proportion of participants who reported anxiety symptoms rose from 57% to 68%.\n\nAs political rhetoric in the last couple of years has boiled over on issues such as teaching about LGBTQ+ identity in schools, transgender students playing on sports teams and whether to allow gender-affirming care, the share of youth who said they'd experienced symptoms of depression rose from 48% to 54%. Those reporting having suicidal thoughts went from 41% to 47%.\n\nTransgender and nonbinary youth were nearly twice as likely to say they'd struggled with anxiety and suicidal thoughts than their cisgender peers -- a pattern that held steady throughout the first year of data collection on participants in this group.\n\n\"This allows us to clearly and unequivocally document what we know to be true: The manner in which LGBTQ+ youth are treated in this country harms their health and risks their lives, and it is only getting worse,\" Trevor Project CEO Jaymes Black said in a statement.\n\nEven in California, a state that's considered a haven for trans people, the climate seems to be shifting. In a surprising move for an elected official who has proclaimed support for the trans community, Gov. Gavin Newsom recently vetoed a bill that would have required 12 months of hormone therapy coverage for transgender patients in California, citing cost concerns.\n\nAnother striking finding in the study: an increase in the proportion of youth who said they've faced pressure to undergo \"conversion therapy,\" a controversial and scientifically dubious counseling process that its advocates claim can suppress or erase same-sex desire, change the gender identity of youth who identify as trans and discourage those are questioning.\n\nThe National Alliance on Mental Illness calls conversion therapy \"discredited, discriminatory, and harmful,\" and supports bans on a practice it says can damage, not improve, the mental health of those who undergo it. California became the first state to ban the practice in 2012.\n\nBut reports of being threatened with conversion therapy doubled in the first year of tracking, with 22% of respondents saying they experienced this intimidation, up from 11% at the start of the study. The percentage of those who said they'd been exposed to conversion therapy in some way climbed from 9% to 15%.\n\nThe findings come as the Supreme Court hears arguments in one of the most closely watched cases of its current term. In Chiles vs. Salazar, a Christian counselor has argued that Colorado's ban on conversion therapy for LGBTQ+ youth violates her free speech rights in voluntary therapy sessions with questioning minors. Members of the court's conservative majority, who prevailed earlier this year in a decision upholding a Tennessee ban on gender-affirming care for minors, openly voiced skepticism about the Colorado ban in hearings this week. The court's decision is expected to rule in case by the end of its session in June.\n\n\"Many people believe it to be a relic of the past, but the data indicate that these dangerous practices are still happening,\" said Dr. Ronita Nath, Trevor Project's vice president of research. She added that threats of and exposure to conversion therapy contributed to future depression and suicidal thoughts among study participants.\n\nThe researchers started recruiting in September 2023. Each participant filled out mental health surveys every six months after joining the study.\n\nThis is the first time that the Trevor Project has monitored changes in queer youth mental health over such a long period. Nath said this type of sophisticated, long-range study is important for public health providers and policymakers alike because it provides fresh evidence of a cause-and-effect link between societal risk factors -- such as pressure to undergo conversion therapy and a lack of access to affordable mental health services -- and future crises.\n\n\"Societal and structural conditions are driving these mental health outcomes, not just coinciding with them,\" Nath said.\n\nThe study did identify some positives: The percentage of LGBTQ+ youth who reported feeling supported at school rose from 53% to 58% over the course of the first year. Also, 73% of participants said they sought help from friends, up from 45% at the beginning of the first year.\n\nMany who took part in the study, however, said they avoided seeking care either because they couldn't afford it or because they worried they'd be stigmatized for having a mental health crisis.\n\nOnly 60% of respondents said they had access to mental health services by the end of their first year in the study, down from the 80% at the start of their tracking.\n\nOn the other hand, 75% of those who did get counseling over the course of their first year in the study said they benefited from it, up from 61% at the start.\n\nThe proportion of youths who said they sought help during suicidal episodes doubled to 64% in that time frame, though, which points to the increased level of distress youths experienced in that span, Nath said.\n\n\u00a92025 Los Angeles Times.

        "title": "Nancy Pelosi Hasn't Announced Her 2026 Plans. Scott Wiener Is Running Anyway.",
        "description": "For years, Scott Wiener, a Democratic state senator, has eyed San Francisco's main congressional seat after building significant clout on housing policy and L.G.B.T.Q. rights in California. But there was always a seemingly insurmountable roadblock, and her name was Nancy Pelosi.\n\nMr. Wiener, 55, had long vowed not to run for the seat until Ms. Pelosi announced her retirement. It was partly deferential, as the party establishment has frowned upon challenging a sitting member of Congress. And it was partly practical, as Ms. Pelosi has been revered in San Francisco, especially after she rose to the speakership.\n\nMs. Pelosi, 85, has not yet said whether she will run for a 21st term next year. But Mr. Wiener told The New York Times that he was done waiting, old promises be damned. On Wednesday, he will enter the race.\n\nIt was the clearest sign yet that younger generations of Democrats were prepared to buck convention as their party struggles to reinvent itself after losing control of Congress and the White House last year.\n\n\"The world changes,\" Mr. Wiener said in an interview at a cafe in the Castro District, the San Francisco gay neighborhood where he owns a small condo. \"I made a decision that it makes sense for me to get into the race now because I'm passionate about San Francisco having the best possible representation.\"\n\nThe talk in San Francisco has increased over the past year about whether Ms. Pelosi would retire after representing the city for nearly four decades.\n\nShe wields power, but quietly in the background more than before, as has been the case with California's gerrymandering effort to counter Republicans this year. She remains healthy, but a fall last December on a marble staircase in Luxembourg forced her to get emergency hip replacement surgery. The longer she goes without announcing her 2026 plans, the more speculation rises.\n\nYet Ms. Pelosi remains a political icon in a city known for its powerhouse Democrats, from former Vice President Kamala Harris to Gov. Gavin Newsom and former Senator Dianne Feinstein.\n\nIan Krager, a spokesman for Ms. Pelosi, said she had no comment about her future plans and that she was fully focused on passing Proposition 50, the November state ballot measure that would redraw California's congressional districts. He said Ms. Pelosi also had no comment about Mr. Wiener's decision to enter the race.\n\nMr. Wiener praised Ms. Pelosi and declined to answer most questions about her. He would not say whether she was too old to serve effectively or whether he had told her personally that he would enter the race.\n\nBut he did not hold back when it came to Saikat Chakrabarti, a wealthy, progressive firebrand who filed to run for the seat in February. And Mr. Wiener justified his entrance as a matter of ensuring that the upstart would not become Ms. Pelosi's successor.\n\nMr. Chakrabarti, 39, may be best known for having helped Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez leap from New York City bartender to congresswoman and serving as her first chief of staff. He has hundreds of millions of dollars in personal wealth after being the third employee at Stripe, a tech company that focuses on payment processing.\n\nMr. Wiener said it was clear that Mr. Chakrabarti had the campaign skills and money to be a threat. What he doesn't have, Mr. Wiener said pointedly, is a deep understanding of San Francisco.\n\n\"He has so little connection to San Francisco and really never did anything in San Francisco before he started running for Congress,\" Mr. Wiener said. \"He is trying to buy the seat.\"\n\nMr. Chakrabarti countered on Tuesday that he had lived in the city since 2009 and was running to save democracy. He said the best way to beat back President Trump's \"authoritarian coup\" was to prove that Democrats could address the cost-of-living crisis and win back the support of working people.\n\n\"He's right that, politically, I've done way more in Congress, but that is why I'm applying for a job in Congress,\" Mr. Chakrabarti said.\n\nMs. Pelosi's daughter, Christine Pelosi, has long been considered a possible successor. On Tuesday, the younger Ms. Pelosi texted a photo of herself from the Democratic National Committee's women's leadership forum in Washington. She wore a cream-colored scarf with the Bill of Rights sewn onto it.\n\n\"I'm 100% devoted to passing Prop. 50,\" she texted. \"And being deluged with requests for my scarf.\"\n\nEric Jaye, a longtime San Francisco political consultant, said Mr. Wiener's decision made perfect sense.\n\nHe said that American voters were \"very restive\" and were interested in electing younger, more progressive candidates, such as Zohran Mamdani, the front-runner for New York City mayor. Mr. Chakrabarti could benefit from that tide, he said, so Mr. Wiener needed to jump into the race or risk losing his window forever.\n\n\"He deferred and demurred a long, long time, and I think it got to the point where that was no longer politically sustainable,\" Mr. Jaye said.\n\nMr. Wiener grew up in New Jersey and attended Duke University and Harvard Law School before moving to San Francisco in 1997. He said he was drawn to the city by the promise of living freely as a gay man, though he was also devastated by the deaths from AIDS that he saw all around him and how the federal government had done little about it.\n\nHe said discrimination against gay men back then had parallels today in Mr. Trump's attacks on transgender people, drag queens, immigrants and others.\n\n\"These are people who are just trying to live their lives and be who they are, and they're being treated like human garbage,\" he said. \"We have a responsibility to stick up for them.\"\n\nAfter serving on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, Mr. Wiener was elected to the State Legislature in 2016. He has played a pivotal role in the advancement of bills to accelerate housing construction in California, including legislation enacted this year to allow tall apartment buildings near transit stops over the objections of local officials.\n\nIf Mr. Wiener wins his race, he would become the first gay person to represent San Francisco in federal elected office.\n\nAlmost anywhere else, Mr. Wiener would be considered liberal. But in San Francisco, some progressives have dismissed him as a corporate-friendly Democrat because his laserlike focus on building more housing has benefited developers.\n\nNationally, he has been called by Breitbart News \"California's most radical legislator\" for writing laws that include making California a sanctuary state for transgender people and banning Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents from wearing masks. He said he had regularly received death threats.\n\nHe has not shied away from scrapping with Fox News reporters and conservatives such as Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, Republican of Georgia. He sometimes posts images of himself in skimpy clothing from the Folsom Street Fair, an annual San Francisco festival that celebrates the kink and leather communities. He said he would not stop living authentically if he were elected to Congress.\n\n\"I'm going to be me,\" he said.",

        "title": "Can the White House's flood-the-zone social strategy win the shutdown?",
        "description": "Nicolle Wallace reacts to Donald Trump's vile social media post over No Kings protest\n\nWhite House digital staffers have unleashed a social media strategy full of taunting memes and fake videos, following President Donald Trump's lead in a bid to bolster his base as the government shutdown drags on.\n\nThe amped-up tactics are meant to mock Democrats for their proposal to reverse recently passed restrictions on Medicaid, which the GOP falsely claims pays for health care for undocumented immigrants. The memes include a recurring stunt of placing animated sombreros atop images of Democratic leaders.\n\nDemocrats, for their part, have not responded in kind on social media. Instead, they have mostly stuck to sharing their segments on cable news, and posting explainer videos on the health care tax credits they're pushing to extend in negotiations. They've also continued to criticize the president's social media activity.\n\nWhich approach wins out in the minds of voters and vulnerable lawmakers could help determine how long the shutdown continues and which party ultimately gets more of what it wants.\n\nThe online attacks underscore a social media apparatus surrounding Trump that reflects his own personal digital habits and brazen approach to politics. His aides are \"very much in tune with President Trump's style, which is 'controversy enhances message,' and social media helps enhance that controversy,\" said Bryan Lanza, a former Trump campaign senior adviser.\n\nThat was \"a theory in Trump 1.0,\" Lanza added, a reference to the president's first term. \"It's just become a proven fact in Trump 2.0,\" he said.\n\nCase in point: In a late-night post on his preferred platform, Truth Social, Trump shared a video showing House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries -- the first Black person to hold that job -- wearing a fake sombrero and curled mustache outside the West Wing. It was also artificially manipulated to depict Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer delivering remarks and using profanities degrading his own party that Schumer never said.\n\nThat post came hours after an unfruitful meeting between party leaders in the Oval Office about the budget standoff, and it instantly caught heat from Democrats. \"It's disgraceful. It's racist,\" Rep. Madeleine Dean, D-Pa., said in a confrontational exchange caught on camera with Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson, who replied saying it was \"not my style.\"\n\nIn a news conference the following day, a defiant Jeffries dared the president, \"The next time you have something to say about me, don't cop out through a racist and fake AI video. When I'm back in the Oval Office, say it to my face.\"\n\nIt's unclear who created the video. Trump is known to repost content from his supporters online, but MSNBC could not identify whether the video was originally shared by another user before it was posted to the president's personal account. Regardless, after it generated headlines and provoked Democrats, the White House seized on the imagery on its own official social platforms.\n\nThe sizes of the sombreros have gotten progressively larger in subsequent posts, an intentional choice by Trump's team. One Instagram post featured Sesame Street's Elmo screaming with bright-red flames behind him and donning a sombrero. \"We are doubling down,\" a slide on the same post reads, with a smiley face.\n\nOn Friday, the White House and a handful of other agencies joined Bluesky, an alternative platform to X, where users tend to lean progressive. The trolling continued over the weekend, with the White House posting images of Trump and Vice President JD Vance wearing crowns -- above more images of Jeffries and Schumer in sombreros -- while large crowds protested Trump's agenda across the country in a demonstration dubbed \"No Kings.\"\n\nAfter Trump's account posted a fake video of him flying a plane dumping a substance that appeared to be excrement or sewage on demonstrators, Democratic influencer Harry Sisson asked on X: \"Can a reporter please ask Trump why he posted an AI video of himself dropping poop on me from a fighter jet? That would be great thanks.\"\n\nThe memes come against the backdrop of the administration pursuing a widespread mass deportation effort of undocumented immigrants in major cities, a campaign that detractors argue disproportionately targets Latino communities.\n\nIn its first posts on Bluesky, the State Department wrote, \"We also heard this is a great place to research visa revocations.\"\n\nElected Democrats have largely refused to take the bait. California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who scored attention a few weeks ago with a series of social posts mimicking Trump's exclamation point-laden and all-caps postings, has had a few viral shutdown clips. But his peers have mostly preferred not to hit back sharply online.\n\nEric Wilson, a Republican digital strategist who worked on Marco Rubio's presidential campaign, said Democrats \"come off looking like a scold\" by complaining \"about something that's clearly meant to be funny.\" Still, Wilson acknowledged, the Democratic Party's base \"would be very upset with them if they weren't out there saying, 'This is wrong.'\"\n\nThe Democratic National Committee did share a video of kittens explaining the shutdown on TikTok, with 4.4 million views as of Monday, showing a cat crying over higher health care bills.\n\nThere are signs that the staid approach is resonating: A CNBC survey of Americans conducted between Oct. 8 and Oct. 12 found 53% said they would blame Trump and Republicans if the shutdown \"were to cause significant economic damage.\"\n\n\"When you have people like Mike Johnson and Donald Trump saying the words 'Affordable Care Act,' or saying the words 'health care,' then you know that Democrats are the ones driving the narrative,\" said Parker Butler, a digital strategist for Democratic campaigns. \"I think this is one of the few examples in this past year where I think we've seen that.\"\n\nThe key question is whether the White House's shutdown social strategy is catered to Trump's core or meant to win over the broader public. The answer matters, given the president faces an uphill battle to convince voters that Democrats are responsible for the lapse in government funding that has caused air-travel disruptions, museum closures and missed paychecks for thousands.\n\nButler says the White House is \"basically preaching to the choir,\" suggesting that the sombrero memes, for example, don't resonate with \"persuadable voters.\"\n\n\"You can see that with the polling,\" he added.\n\nThe White House account's recent tone resembles that of a campaign. Trump outperformed his rivals on social platforms like TikTok in 2024. Previous administrations, including former President Joe Biden's staff, have also made eye-catching social-media posts that are typically unusual for official accounts, where posts tend to be more informational and generic, though still fawning. But Trump's staff is taking bigger swings online, more often.\n\n\"They understand that flooding the zone is what works,\" Wilson said of Trump's White House. \"I still communicate with my friends with memes, and funny YouTube videos, and so the fact that the White House is doing that as well just shows that they understand how conversations happen.\"\n\nSometimes the president's social media activity complicates his communication team's messaging. Trump posted an ominous AI-generated video portraying his Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought -- who is spearheading mass layoffs of federal employees -- as the grim reaper. That ran starkly counter to his press secretary describing the firings as \"an unfortunate consequence,\" and his chief economist saying the administration doesn't \"want anyone to lose their job.\"\n\nHumor and memes \"can be an effective strategy, but there has to be a little bit of tact behind it,\" Butler said. \"I don't think that they've shown that in this shutdown battle.\"\n\nIt doesn't seem like the president's social team is slowing down any time soon. As Vance told reporters Oct. 1 in a comment addressed to Jeffries: \"If you help us reopen the government, the sombrero memes will stop.\"",

        "title": "Analysis | We tested the tech industry's fake-video warning system. It's broken.",
        "description": "(Illustration by Kat Rudell Brooks/The Washington Post; iStock)\n\nAs new artificial intelligence tools generated a cascade of increasingly realistic fake videos and images online, tech companies developed a plan to prevent mass confusion.\n\nCompanies such as ChatGPT maker OpenAI pledged to imbue each fake video with a tamperproof marker to signal it was AI-generated. Social media platforms including Facebook and TikTok said they would make those markers visible to users, allowing viewers to know when content was fake and experts to trace its origins.\n\nThe system was supposed to provide a digital ground-truth to help guard against deepfakes disrupting elections or inciting turmoil. Tech companies made it part of their response to government regulators asking for safeguards on AI's power.\n\nBut tests by The Washington Post on eight major social platforms found that only one of them added a warning to an uploaded AI video. That disclosure, by Google's YouTube, was hidden from view inside a description attached to the clip.\n\nMoreover, all of the platforms tested stripped the digital marker from the clip that disclosed it was synthetic, preventing anyone from inspecting its provenance.\n\nAI-generated video now has more disruptive power than ever due to technical advances that allow fake clips to be indistinguishable from real footage and the widespread availability of the technology. Yet none of the platforms tested fully supported the standard for marking AI content that tech companies have touted for years, The Post found.\n\nRecent advances in AI leave online audiences \"beyond the point of being able to cope with the scale and the realism\" of AI content, said Arosha Bandara, a researcher at Britain's Open University who has studied labeling of AI-generated content. A robust system for disclosure is important, he added. A law signed by California Gov. Gavin Newsom last week will from next year require large online platforms to make \"conspicuously available\" any information about a piece of content that could indicate whether it was altered or generated with AI.\n\nThe Post tested the platforms using a video generated with Sora, the powerful new video app launched by OpenAI.\n\nChrista Muldoon, a spokesperson for Google, said the Content Credentials standard for marking media files that The Post tested is one piece of its strategy for giving people access to information on how content was made. \"We recognize adoption will take time and this work is ongoing,\" she said.\n\nMeta, OpenAI, TikTok, Snapchat and X did not respond to requests for comment. LinkedIn and Pinterest declined to comment on the record. The Post has a content partnership with OpenAI.\n\nThe rise of AI has heightened concerns about manipulated or misleading content. In 2021, six companies including Microsoft, Adobe and the BBC partnered to develop Content Credentials, a technical standard for adding metadata to media files disclosing how their content was made.\n\nFiles tagged with Content Credentials have tamperproof metadata, which contains details like the camera model that captured the footage, the software used to edit it or the AI system that generated it.\n\nThe data aims to give \"a peek at the content's history available for anyone to access, at any time,\" according to the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity, the group that oversees the standard. The group lists hundreds of members including chipmakers like Intel, camera manufacturers like Sony and Nikon, news organizations like the Associated Press, tech giants such as Google and Meta and their upstart rivals like OpenAI and TikTok.\n\nBut Content Credentials is a voluntary system, and if social media platforms don't implement the standard, it is effectively useless.\n\nTo test which social media sites fully implement the standard, The Post generated a video with Sora and confirmed that it included the Content Credentials data, which mentioned Sora and included the phrases \"Created using Generative AI\" and \"Issued by OpenAI.\" The same clip was posted to eight social platforms using the default settings for a new post.\n\nNo platform that The Post tested kept the Content Credentials data on the video or let users access it. Only YouTube displayed any indication that the video was not real, but the platform's disclosure was added to the description attached to a video, which is only visible to users who click through. It described the clip as \"Altered or synthetic content\" and did not mention AI.\n\nGoogle, which owns YouTube; Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram; and Microsoft, which owns LinkedIn and OpenAI, are steering committee members of the coalition behind Content Credentials. TikTok is a general member and so was Twitter, until Elon Musk acquired the company and renamed it to X.\n\nTikTok and LinkedIn said last year that they would implement Content Credentials to label AI-generated video. Meta said last year it would use the standard to label AI-generated images, and Pinterest said the same in April this year, but neither said they would add markers to video. Snapchat does not appear to have ties to Content Credentials.\n\nAndrew Jenks, executive chair of the coalition behind Content Credentials, said in a statement that users must have access to \"how content was made, including which tools were used.\" The industry \"must continue evolving our approaches to ensure this level of transparency is both possible and effective,\" he said.\n\nGoogle, OpenAI and other AI firms committed during the Biden administration to developing systems like Content Credentials to \"ensure that users know when content is AI generated.\"\n\nSora, released by OpenAI this month, represents a huge test for the creative and commercial potential of highly realistic AI video -- but also its potential downsides. The app can generate short clips that insert a real person's likeness into just about any scenario. Users can opt to share their likeness for others to include in their creations.\n\nOn a webpage titled \"Launching Sora responsibly,\" OpenAI said it adds Content Credentials metadata to all videos, calling it an \"industry standard signature.\" The Post's tests demonstrate that the industry is not using that standard.\n\nOpenAI also listed other mitigations, which have their own flaws.\n\nThe company adds a transparent logo or watermark to all Sora clips, but suggested it may be eliminated in the future. Services that strip out the watermark have sprung up online, and a version of Sora that software developers can use does not add either the watermark or Content Credentials metadata. Users on the \"pro\" plan can download some Sora-generated videos without watermarks, according to company documentation.\n\nOpenAI also said it embeds invisible authenticity markers into Sora videos and has developed a system that can detect them \"with high accuracy,\" but the tool is for internal use only. Google's SynthID project does something similar, but like Sora's detector, the tool is not available to the general public.\n\nOther companies sell tools that aim to detect manipulated content from patterns in an image or video. These have proved unreliable, and social media platforms have not widely deployed them.\n\nAll the while, the tech industry continues building and releasing products that let anyone generate increasingly convincing video clips in seconds.\n\nResearch by Bandara of the Open University, with Dilrukshi Gamage of the University of Colombo in Sri Lanka, found that labeling content as AI-generated was effective at informing people it was fake.\n\nBut finding a way to reliably provide such labels is proving tricky. \"The potential dystopia is that all content, all video, photography, has to be mistrusted until it can be positively authenticated as being real,\" Bandara said.",

        "title": "How Obama maneuvered behind the scenes to fight Trump on redistricting",
        "description": "Former president Barack Obama has launched an urgent behind-the-scenes effort to rally support for California's redistricting ballot measure. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)\n\nIn late July, Barack Obama spoke with his former attorney general, Eric Holder, about how Democrats should respond to President Donald Trump's unprecedented mid-decade push to add five favorable U.S. House seats to protect the Republican majority. They had each spent days conflicted about what to do.\n\nBoth had previously championed nonpartisan redistricting. But they agreed that letting Trump's effort in Texas go unanswered wasn't an option. They kept coming back to a plan from California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) that would offset the move with five new Democratic-leaning seats. Within days, Holder drafted a statement endorsing the proposal and ran it by the former president, who quickly signed off. It marked a stark shift that, in their view, was a sign of the emergency measures they believed were required.\n\n\"We're doing things that kind of go against what we talked about,\" Holder said. But they decided, \"we have to preserve our democracy if ultimately we're going to heal it.\"\n\nThat phone call set in motion an urgent behind-the-scenes effort by the former president to rally support for California's Proposition 50, which is on the ballot in a Nov. 4 special election. If successful, it would mark a concrete countermeasure against Trump's agenda less than a year into his second term -- the kind that Obama has increasingly come to believe is necessary.\n\nObama's involvement in the redistricting fight is a reflection of the deep anxieties he harbors about Trump's second term, according to multiple people familiar with his thinking. It has propelled the ex-president into a more political and public-facing role than he once envisioned. With his enduring popularity and the party still struggling to unite behind new leaders after losing the White House and Congress, no other Democrat commands his level of authority or reach.\n\n\"I think it's really clear that President Obama left office fully intending to play the role that traditionally had been played by former presidents, and that is to go about their interests, professional and otherwise, and leaving the governance up to their successors,\" said Rep. James E. Clyburn (D-South Carolina), a longtime Obama ally. But, he added, \"we are not living in ordinary times. And extraordinary times require extraordinary action.\"\n\nThis article is based on interviews with 19 people, including those close to Obama and Newsom, as well as Democratic strategists and outside advisers, many of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private conversations. Obama declined to be interviewed.\n\nThe ex-president has grown especially worried that some lawmakers and voters are not confronting Trump with the same urgency they showed during his first term -- and that major institutions, including universities and law firms, have too often capitulated to Trump's demands, according to a person familiar with his thinking.\n\n\"We can stand up to this. We can call it like we see it,\" Obama said on a recent podcast. \"We need people who have whatever platforms they have to be able to say, 'no, that's not who we are.'\"\n\nHe has been more pointed in his attacks on Trump in recent weeks and has stepped up his political activity in the run-up to this year's elections on Nov. 4. He filmed an ad for Prop 50 and is scheduled to campaign for Democratic gubernatorial candidates Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey and Abigail Spanberger in Virginia on Nov. 1. And he has been in touch with Newsom's team on additional ways he can help on Prop 50 during the campaign's final push.\n\nTrump, whose political rise was powered by conspiracy theories about Obama's birth certificate, has continued to frequently attack his predecessor. During his second term, Trump has baselessly repeated his assertion that there was \"no doubt\" Obama had committed criminal acts. The White House spent days trying to portray Obama and members of his administration as part of a vast \"treasonous conspiracy\" that tried to thwart Trump's chances in the 2016 election -- prompting a rare rebuke from Obama's office.\n\nObama's goal since leaving office more than eight years ago has been to elevate new leaders and help build a Democratic Party that can survive without him, according to those close to him -- which some Democrats have accused him of failing to achieve when he was president.\n\nThe 44th president has served as a sounding board for several governors, including Newsom, Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania and Wes Moore in Maryland; spoken with candidates such as Zohran Mamdani, who is running for New York mayor, and James Talarico, who is seeking a U.S. Senate seat in Texas; and conferred with several Democrats eyeing a 2028 presidential run. Those conversations have included tactical political advice and candid guidance on the toll a presidential campaign -- and weeks of fundraising on the road -- can take on a family.\n\nBut few tasks have occupied Obama's attention like the redistricting fight, a raw partisan battle he is engaging in after years of loftier, more hopeful rhetoric about bridging divisions. What started in Texas with Trump pressuring Republicans to redraw the map years before it was due for an update has become a national partisan fight pitting red and blue states against each other -- 21 years after Obama gave a speech at the Democratic National Convention declaring, \"There is not a liberal America and a conservative America, there is the United States of America.\"\n\nNow, some Democrats think he should set a more combative tone for the party on other fronts.\n\n\"Beyond redistricting, Obama has been hitting singles when he should be hitting home runs -- making ad hoc statements with no long-term value or more generally staying silent as Rome burns,\" said Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee.\n\nObama's aides say he is choosing carefully when and where to reenter the political arena.\n\n\"Since leaving the White House, President Obama has not hesitated to use his voice when he can drive impact, but he has dedicated his post-presidency to championing the next generation of leaders,\" Eric Schultz, a senior adviser to Obama, said in a statement.\n\nA standard-bearer in a party with a leadership vacuum\n\nObama's plunge into redistricting has no modern precedent, according to presidential historians, who noted that former presidents have largely stayed out of big political battles after leaving office. Obama, who was quieter publicly at the start of Trump's first term, has said he'd speak up whenever a line was crossed -- something he believes has happened far more often in the second term.\n\n\"The redistricting in California was a big step because that was really concrete. It wasn't simply making a speech to rally Democrats or attack the president, when [Obama has] done that before,\" said Julian Zelizer, a presidential historian at Princeton University. \"A lot of Democrats weren't sure where they landed on this, and he made a pretty affirmative statement.\"\n\nBetween July and August, Obama spoke with key architects of the effort, including Newsom and former House speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-California), helping shape the public case for the measure and strategizing how to line up support among California Democrats.\n\nObama's endorsement helped swiftly unite Democrats behind the measure and speed its passage through the California legislature.\n\nMany Democrats say they wish Obama would speak out more often and more forcefully as Trump consolidates power and weakens democratic institutions. The party -- still reeling from sweeping losses in last year's elections -- has at times struggled to regroup or mount a cohesive, effective response to Trump, who polls show is unpopular.\n\n\"He's the closest thing currently to a Democratic standard-bearer because there hasn't been somebody to emerge in the party as the natural leader,\" said Mark Updegrove, a presidential historian and president of the LBJ Foundation.\n\nOn redistricting, some of Obama's most consequential moves happened behind the scenes. As Trump began publicly pressuring Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) to redraw the congressional map for his state -- an idea that initially made some Republicans uneasy -- Newsom and his aides quickly convened attorneys and legal experts to explore California's options.\n\nOne possibility was for the legislature to redraw the map itself, a move that would almost certainly face legal challenges because the state constitution requires nonpartisan redistricting. The other was to put the measure before voters to temporarily change the maps. Newsom and his team concluded that was the more defensible route -- especially because California voters approved a nonpartisan redistricting process in 2008 and 2010.\n\nThat was key to getting Obama and Holder on board. Endorsing Newsom's proposal ran counter to what the National Democratic Redistricting Committee -- the Holder-founded group backed by Obama, which is focused on drawing nonpartisan maps -- stood for. But they felt the response was measured because it was temporary and required a stamp of approval from Californians.\n\n\"Our enduring commitment to fairness does not blind us to reality,\" Holder said in a July 30 statement. \"In this moment steps must be taken to respond to the authoritarian measures being considered in certain states and now so brazenly taken in Texas.\"\n\nQuiet conversations with Newsom\n\nAs Democrats debated publicly whether Newsom's plan went too far -- and risked setting an irreversible precedent -- Obama and his team quietly coordinated with Newsom's office to build support.\n\nPelosi, who was helping Newsom rally California Democrats and raise millions of dollars, spoke several times with Obama, urging an all-hands-on-deck response from the party, according to a person familiar with their conversations.\n\nDemocrats knew selling their voters on a bare-knuckled redistricting power play could be difficult, given that their leaders -- including Obama -- had been preaching the benefits of nonpartisan redistricting for years. Newsom's team polled voters to identify the most effective messengers. The results showed Obama was the most popular political figure among California Democrats and independents by a wide margin.\n\nIn early August, Newsom and Obama spoke on the phone for more than an hour, according to Holder and three other people familiar with the call. The two had little personal history -- Newsom, now seen as a likely 2028 presidential candidate, served as San Francisco mayor and lieutenant governor during Obama's presidency -- but Newsom viewed Obama's support as critical.\n\nThey strategized on how to shepherd the measure through the legislature and communicate it to the public. Newsom and Pelosi thought Obama would have unmatched impact. Obama made clear he intended to back the plan but was waiting for the right moment.\n\nObama's eventual endorsement and ad, said a person close to Newsom, was considered \"a huge step in their relationship.\"\n\nBy mid-August, Obama began lending his voice to the redistricting fight to ensure it received national attention. When Texas Democrats left the state for two weeks to temporarily block a GOP vote on the new map -- prompting threats from Republicans, civil arrest and removal from office -- Obama called in to one of their meetings at a secret location in Illinois to commend their stance.\n\nHe knew the Democratic legislators would have to return to Texas and that Republicans would ultimately pass the map. But he later released a portion of the call to make sure their protest \"would make an imprint on the national conversation,\" according to a person familiar with Obama's thinking.\n\n\"I want all of you to be returning feeling invigorated and know that you have helped to lead what is going to be a long struggle,\" Obama told the lawmakers during a virtual meeting.\n\nFive days later, at a Martha's Vineyard fundraiser for the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, Obama publicly threw his weight behind the California proposal.\n\n\"I want to see as a long-term goal that we do not have political gerrymandering in America. That would be my preference,\" Obama said. \"But I want to be very clear: Given that Texas is taking direction from a partisan White House ... I have tremendous respect for how Governor Newsom has approached this.\"\n\nAlmost overnight, Democrats across the country lined up behind Newsom's plan. Within days, the Democratic-dominated California legislature voted to place the new map on the ballot.\n\nTwo weeks ago, Obama filmed an ad aimed at motivating Democrats and independents to back Prop 50.\n\n\"California, the whole nation is counting on you. Democracy is on the ballot November 4th,\" Obama says in the ad, as a video shows a shadow of Trump and images of the National Guard and Immigration and Customs Enforcement in U.S. cities. \"Republicans want to steal enough seats in Congress to rig the next election and wield unchecked power for two more years. With Prop 50, you can stop Republicans in their tracks.\"\n\nHe sent it to Newsom's team, which added music and other edits and released it last week. The spot is now the most used across California, even as other prominent Democrats have joined the campaign, according to internal metrics obtained by The Post.",

        "title": "San Francisco leaders push back against Trump's National Guard threat",
        "description": "SAN FRANCISCO -- SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- President Donald Trump keeps threatening to send National Guard troops to San Francisco next, blasting the California city as crime-ridden and saying its residents are clamoring for federal help.\n\nBut local and state leaders say that couldn't be farther from the truth, noting overall crime is down and the city has started to turn around its downtrodden pandemic image. Residents and workers out downtown this week said they're puzzled and concerned by Trump's threat.\n\n\"This is a safe American city,\" Mayor Daniel Lurie told The Associated Press last week. \"We got this in San Francisco.\"\n\nThe Republican president has referenced crime as his justification for possibly sending troops to the city of roughly 830,000. He's deployed the Guard over crime concerns to Washington, D.C., where he has direct control of the National Guard, and Memphis, where the Republican governor supports their presence. Los Angeles was the first city where Trump deployed the Guard, arguing it was necessary to protect federal buildings and agents as protesters fought back against mass immigration arrests. He's since said they're needed in Chicago and Portland, Oregon, as well.\n\nResidents and leaders in Portland were surprised by Trump's attention when he described the city as besieged by violent protests. In reality, nightly protests were small and limited to the area outside a federal immigration building. While there were some arrests for violence, the demonstrations were far less intense than those that roiled the downtown in 2020 following the death of George Floyd.\n\nIn San Francisco, too, Trump seems to be relying on an outdated picture of a city often targeted by conservatives.\n\n\"The difference is, I think they want us in San Francisco,\" Trump said Sunday on Fox News. \"San Francisco was truly one of the great cities of the world. And then, 15 years ago, it went wrong. It went woke.\"\n\nHis comments angered and baffled Kate Freudenberger, who works in retail.\n\n\"You've been walking around the city, it's peaceful, there is no insurrection,\" she said Tuesday morning, adding that immigration authorities have not been as active in San Francisco as in other cities, \"so there's really been nothing for us to coalesce around.\"\n\nMarc Benioff, the chief executive of San Francisco-based software giant Salesforce, caused a stir when he told the New York Times earlier this month that he'd welcome Guard troops ito help quell crime ahead of his major annual business conference. He has since apologized for his remarks, saying the conference was the \"largest and safest\" in its history and the Guard is not needed.\n\nSan Francisco is still recovering from the coronavirus pandemic, which emptied its downtown and brought renewed attention to street homelessness and open drug dealing. But signs indicate a city on the upswing. Artificial intelligence startups are snapping up office space, and home rental prices are rising. San Francisco saw a 21% increase from last year in office visits, according to location analytics platform Placer.ai, and public transit ridership is at its highest levels since the pandemic.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal this week declared the city was emerging from its \"doom loop,\" an article the mayor eagerly shared on social media.\n\nSidewalks are cleaner and tent encampments have largely disappeared from view. In the Tenderloin, one of the most troubled neighborhoods, teams of city and nonprofit workers on Monday helped school children cross the street, walked around picking up trash or counseled homeless people. It was a different image than during the pandemic, when hundreds of people camped on sidewalks.\n\nStill, the Tenderloin is a problem spot for public drug use and dealing, as are the Mid-Market and Mission neighborhoods. But overall crime is down more than 26% this year compared to the same period last year, according to the San Francisco Police Department. Vehicle break-ins -- which have vexed tourists and residents alike -- are at a 22-year low, Lurie said.\n\nLurie, a centrist Democrat who has tried to avoid confrontations with Trump by ignoring many of the president's comments, said Monday he'd welcome more federal help to arrest drug dealers and disrupt drug markets. But sending in the Guard wouldn't achieve that, he said.\n\n\"The National Guard does not have the authority to arrest drug dealers -- and sending them to San Francisco will do nothing to get fentanyl off the streets or make our city safer,\" Lurie said in a statement.\n\nSan Francisco voters in 2024 gave police the authority to use drones, surveillance cameras and other technology to fight crime. They also ousted politically progressive District Attorney Chesa Boudin in a 2022 recall election and installed Brooke Jenkins, considered to be much tougher on crime than her predecessor. Lurie has pushed to hire and retain police officers, and entry-level police applications are up 40% over last year.\n\nMeanwhile, Gov. Gavin Newsom's administration has said it would push back forcefully on any deployment, as it did when Trump first ordered the California National Guard into Los Angeles against Newsom's wishes. California Attorney General Rob Bonta vowed to \"be in court within hours, if not minutes\" if there is a federal deployment.\n\nLawsuits by Democratic officials in Chicago and Portland have so far blocked troops from going out on city streets.\n\nLibby Baxter, a retired nurse, said Trump has sent the National Guard to Democratic cities to create \"chaos and unrest\" and she fears the same could happen in San Francisco.\n\n\"I believe that that may happen if they come to San Francisco because we are a very tolerant community, but we don't do well with somebody coming in and trying to dictate or take over certain parts of our city,\" she said.",

        "title": "What to know about efforts to block National Guard deployments in Chicago, Portland, other US cities",
        "description": "CHICAGO -- CHICAGO (AP) -- President Donald Trump's attempts to deploy the military in Democratic-led cities -- over the objections of mayors and governors -- has brought a head-spinning array of court challenges and overlapping rulings.\n\nAs the U.S. Supreme Court ponders whether to clear the way for the National Guard in Chicago, a federal appeals court is hearing arguments in California Gov. Gavin Newsom's challenge to the deployment of troops in Los Angeles. Guard troops could also soon be on the ground in Portland, Oregon, pending legal developments there.\n\nHere are some things to know about legal efforts to block, or deploy, National Guard troops in various cities.\n\nA federal judge in Chicago already blocked deployment of National Guard troops to the Chicago area for two weeks. On Wednesday, she'll hold a hearing to consider whether to extend that order -- but anything she does could be moot if the U.S. Supreme Court rules in the meantime.\n\nAttorneys representing the Trump administration said in court filings Tuesday that they would agree to possibly extend the block on deployment of troops for 30 days. However, they are also continuing to ask the U.S. Supreme Court to intervene. The Trump administration is pressing for an emergency order from the U.S. Supreme Court that would allow Guard troops to be deployed.\n\n\"Every day this improper TRO remains in effect imposes grievous and irreparable harm on the Executive,\" Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in a Supreme Court filing Tuesday.\n\nLawyers representing Chicago and Illinois have asked that the Supreme Court continue to block the deployment to the Chicago area, calling it a \"dramatic step.\"\n\nAn appeals court said Monday that Trump could take command of 200 Oregon National Guard troops, but for now a separate court order blocks him from actually deploying them.\n\nU.S. District Judge Karin Immergut, a Trump appointee, issued two temporary restraining orders early this month. One prohibited Trump from calling up the Oregon troops so he could send them to Portland. The other prohibited him from sending any National Guard members to Oregon at all, after he tried to evade the first order by deploying California troops instead.\n\nThe Justice Department appealed the first order, and in a 2-1 ruling Monday, a panel from the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals sided with the administration.\n\nHowever, Immergut's second order remains in effect, so no troops may immediately be deployed.\n\nThe case is still before the courts.\n\nA panel of judges with the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Pasadena is set to hear arguments Wednesday related to Trump's deployment of National Guard troops to Los Angeles.\n\nA district court found the Trump administration violated federal law when he sent the troops to Los Angeles in early June after protests to his immigration crackdown.\n\nJudge Charles Breyer handed Newsom an early victory in the case on June 13 when he ordered control of National Guard troops back to California. But in an emergency ruling, an appeals court panel sided with the Trump administration, allowing the troops to remain in federal hands as the lawsuit unfolds.\n\nThe appeals court will weigh whether to vacate Breyer's June order.\n\nThe same three-judge panel is also handling the Trump administration's appeal to a Sept. 2 ruling by Breyer who found the president violated the Posse Comitatus Act, an 1878 law that prohibits military enforcement of domestic laws.\n\nIn Charleston, West Virginia, a state court hearing is set for Friday in a lawsuit filed by two groups who want to block the deployment of the state National Guard to Washington, D.C. More than 300 Guard members have been in the nation's capital supporting Trump's initiative since late August.\n\nIn Tennessee, Democratic elected officials sued last Friday to try to stop the ongoing Guard deployment in Memphis. They said Republican Gov. Bill Lee, acting on a request from Trump, violated the state constitution, which says the Guard can be called up during \"rebellion or invasion\" but only with the blessing of state lawmakers.\n\nSince their arrival on Oct. 10, troops have been patrolling areas of downtown Memphis, including near the iconic Pyramid, wearing fatigues and protective vests that say \"military police,\" with guns in holsters. Officials have said Guard members have no arrest power.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Gene Johnson in Seattle, Mark Sherman in Washington, D.C., Olga R.

        "title": "Government shutdown will delay millions of Californians' CalFresh payments, Newsom says",
        "description": "On the 21st day of the federal government shutdown, Gov. Gavin Newsom is blaming the Trump administration and Republican lawmakers for what his office announced will soon be disruptions to millions of Californians' CalFresh food benefits, known federally as SNAP.\n\n\"Trump's failure to open the federal government is now endangering people's lives and making basic needs like food more expensive -- just as the holidays arrive,\" Newsom said in a statement.\n\nNewsom said that more than five million Californians who utilize CalFresh's food assistance could see no money loaded onto their benefit cards in November if the government does not reopen by Thursday.\n\nLocal agencies and food banks are bracing for a potential increase in need due to the delays in food assistance.\n\n\"We are preparing for thousands of additional households coming into our services,\" said Genevieve Pyeatt, director of programs for the Yolo Food Bank.\n\nPyeatt told CBS Sacramento that the Yolo Food Band and the Yolo County Health and Human Services office have teamed up to be proactive, planning right now to host emergency food distributions at CalFresh offices in Davis, Woodland and West Sacramento starting the first week of November to help families if the government does not open back up.\n\n\"Our mission is to provide food to those that are food insecure and to our neighbors. So we take it very seriously,\" Pyeatt said.\n\nPyeatt said the food bank has kept a close eye on the ongoing government shutdown and is preparing for an increase in need for their assistance. They are working to be ready to answer the call of community members, but it comes at a tough time for the agency.\n\n\"We experienced a huge loss in federal cuts already as a food bank, and so we had to adapt to that,\" Pyeatt said. \"Unfortunately, with less food resources, less funds, but still the need increasing, we're always kind of battling with this balance.\"\n\nYolo is one of the most food-insecure counties in California. Pyeatt said the local need is up about 20% over the past three years, and they serve around 30,000 households each month.\n\n\"Thanks to Donald Trump and his MAGA lapdogs in Congress, the government shutdown is going to deprive millions of Californians in need of their November food benefits,\" Newsom wrote on X. \"It is long past time for the GOP to grow a spine, stand up to Trump, and stop endangering people's lives.\"\n\nPresident Trump pushed back on the implication that Republicans are to be blamed for the government shutdown on Tuesday at the White House.\n\n\"From the beginning, our message has been very simple. We will not be extorted on this crazy plot of theirs,\" Mr. Trump said.\n\nRepublican lawmakers like Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R) also point the finger at the other party.\n\n\"We are going to keep voting to open the government and eventually, the Democrats, hopefully sooner or later, will come around,\" said Sen. Thune.\n\nMeanwhile, some California seniors living on a fixed income, like Shari Horne, feel caught off guard with their CalFresh payments in jeopardy.\n\nHorne receives a few hundred dollars a month on her CalFresh card. She cares for her husband with disabilities.\n\n\"We're very concerned. There's a lot of people here that depend on that,\" Horne said. \"It's very challenging. I hadn't thought about what we would do because I didn't know this was going to happen.\"\n\nThe Yolo Food Bank is working to add those emergency food distribution events to their calendar, with dates and times still to be determined.\n\nThe hope is that in the days to come, they will not be needed if the government reopens.\n\nFind food resources near you on their website.

        "title": "Nobel winners and celebrities challenge Silicon Valley's vision for the future",
        "description": "Prince Harry, the Duke of Sussex, speaks at a Project Healthy Minds event on Oct. 10 in New York. (Evan Agostini/Invision/AP)\n\nSAN FRANCISCO -- The tech industry is spending billions of dollars in a drive to upgrade today's artificial intelligence tools into so-called superintelligence, a fuzzy term used by companies like Meta and OpenAI to invoke future software they hope will outperform humans in every way. On Wednesday, a loose coalition of Nobel laureates, policymakers, celebrities and British royalty said that work on the hypothetical technology must be halted.\n\n\"We call for a prohibition on the development of superintelligence,\" said a public statement with more than 700 signatories, including prominent AI researchers, Prince Harry, former Trump adviser Stephen K. Bannon and the Obama administration's national security adviser Susan Rice. The ban should be lifted only after \"strong public buy-in\" and scientific consensus that the technology can be made safe, the statement said, without specifying how either could be measured.\n\nMost AI experts in industry and academia do not think such technology is imminent, despite moves like Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg spending about $15 billion to launch a new \"superintelligence lab\" this summer. Tech firms and national governments are competing to speed up AI development, making any ban unlikely.\n\nBut the statement, coordinated by the nonprofit Future of Life Institute, comes at a time of renewed debate in Washington, Silicon Valley and across the nation about whether the potentially disruptive effects of existing AI technology require new regulations.\n\nHalf of Americans are more concerned about AI than they are excited about it, according to a spring survey by the Pew Research Center. A Gallup poll from around the same time found that 80 percent of Americans supported rules for AI even if they slowed down its technological development.\n\nThe Trump administration has aligned itself with tech figures who favor minimal regulation, rolling back AI rules introduced by President Joe Biden and supporting a proposed federal moratorium on state AI regulation.\n\nBut federal and state lawmakers have launched dozens of efforts to regulate AI technology. More than half of U.S. states have passed AI-related laws, creating a patchwork of regulations across the country.\n\nIn response, Meta and venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz in recent months set up political action committees to support candidates that oppose strict AI regulation.\n\n\"The state of AI regulation is rapidly evolving. As public use of AI tools surges, policymakers are digging in,\" said Katy Milner, a partner at law firm Hogan Lovells who works with technology companies. \"Congress and the states have introduced hundreds of AI-related bills on issues such as data privacy and government use, with a few already enacted and many more bills likely to follow.\"\n\nFew of those bills are likely to focus on the kind of speculative AI technology targeted in Wednesday's statement released by the Future of Life Institute.\n\nThe nonprofit organized an open letter in 2023 in which some business leaders and AI researchers called for a six-month \"pause\" on the training of more capable AI, but that did not appear to slow down the tech industry.\n\n\"Many people want powerful AI tools for science, medicine, productivity and other benefits. But the path AI corporations are taking, of racing toward smarter-than-human AI that is designed to replace people, is wildly out of step with what the public wants,\" said Anthony Aguirre, co-founder and executive director of the Future of Life Institute.\n\nWednesday's statement was also signed by actor Joseph Gordon-Levitt and several Nobel laureates in physics, including Geoffrey Hinton, an AI researcher widely seen as laying the groundwork for today's AI tools. Hinton left Google in 2023 to speak more freely about his concerns about AI technology.\n\nStates like California have focused on regulations on potential harms of AI tools in daily use such as chatbots or requiring more transparency from companies developing AI.\n\nIn September, California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) signed a law that requires AI companies to publish safety reports detailing potential \"catastrophic risks\" of their technology -- such as enabling hackers to break encryption software or terrorists to make new bioweapons.\n\nThis month, Newsom signed the nation's first law regulating how AI chatbots can interact with minors, after three U.S. families alleged in separate lawsuits that an AI chatbot had contributed to a teen's death by suicide.\n\nIn Washington, some Republican politicians continue to fight against AI regulation at both the federal and state level. Proponents of unfettered AI development nearly passed a 10-year moratorium on most state-level AI laws as part of Republicans' sweeping tax and immigration bill earlier this year.\n\nIt ultimately failed in the Senate after opponents of the measure including labor and children's safety advocates joined state lawmakers and attorneys general from both major parties in criticizing the moratorium. They alleged it was an infringement on states' rights and a giveaway to Big Tech.\n\nIn a bid to resurrect the idea of a federal shield for AI firms, President Donald Trump in July released an \"AI Action Plan\" that called for blocking certain federal funding from states that pass AI laws deemed \"burdensome.\" Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) has introduced a bill that would allow AI companies to apply for two-year exemptions from external regulations.",

        "title": "US Marshal and undocumented immigrant shot during ICE stop in Los Angeles, DHS says",
        "description": "A month into 'Operation Midway Blitz,' protesters in Chicago are taking to the streets to fight against the Trump administration's immigration policies.\n\nA man was shot in the elbow, and a deputy U.S. Marshal was hit in the hand by a ricochet bullet during an immigration enforcement operation in Los Angeles on the morning of Oct. 21, the Department of Homeland Security said.\n\nThe shooting occurred in downtown Los Angeles during what the DHS described as a \"targeted traffic enforcement stop.\" Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary for public affairs at the DHS, said the U.S. Marshals Service was assisting Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents conducting a traffic stop of a man who had entered the country illegally.\n\nMcLaughlin, who noted that the investigation remains ongoing and information was preliminary, said federal immigration agents and the U.S. Marshals Service had pulled the man over using a \"standard law enforcement procedure.\" The man then \"weaponized his vehicle and began ramming the law enforcement vehicle in an attempt to flee,\" according to McLaughlin.\n\n\"Fearing for the safety of the public and law enforcement, our officers followed their training and fired defensive shots,\" McLaughlin said in a statement on X.\n\nThe man was shot in the elbow while attempting to flee from the scene, and the deputy U.S. Marshal was injured by a ricochet bullet, McLaughlin said. Both the deputy marshal and the suspect were transported to the hospital.\n\nThe DHS did not provide further details on what procedure ICE agents used or when the man entered the United States, but McLaughlin said he had previously escaped from custody and had attempted to evade arrest before.\n\nFederal, local agencies investigating incident\n\nThe U.S. Marshals Service said in a statement that its Central District of California office was involved in a \"line-of-duty shooting\" on Oct. 21, in which a deputy marshal sustained non-life-threatening injuries. The deputy marshal was in stable condition, according to the agency.\n\nThe agency said it will not release the identities of the deputy marshals involved in shooting incidents \"until the conclusion of all investigations surrounding the incident.\" The Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Los Angeles Police Department are investigating the incident.\n\nThe FBI said in a statement that its Evidence Response Team was processing the scene. It added that it was working with the U.S. Marshals Service, Department of Homeland Security, and the LAPD.\n\nFBI agents were not involved in the incident, according to the agency. Los Angeles police officers were providing outer perimeter traffic control, the FBI said.\n\nShooting comes amid tensions over federal immigration crackdown\n\nThe incident comes amid growing tensions in major U.S. cities over President Donald Trump's aggressive immigration crackdown. McLaughlin attributed the shooting to the \"conduct and rhetoric by sanctuary politicians and activists who urge illegal aliens to resist arrest.\"\n\nBut activists and protesters have decried what they call heavy-handed policing in Democratic-run cities, including Los Angeles, New York, Washington, D.C., and Portland, Oregon.\n\nLos Angeles County has been at the epicenter of the Trump administration's immigration crackdown. In June, Trump sent the National Guard and U.S. Marines into the city to protect federal buildings and protect ICE agents as they carried out raids, prompting widespread protests.\n\nThe protests in Los Angeles County began as a reaction to a handful of immigration raids, including one outside a Home Depot and another at a clothing manufacturer in the city's garment district. The raids and subsequent outrage came as the Trump administration stepped up its detention and deportation of immigrants, including at workplaces, traffic stops, and routine legal check-ins.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom, one of the leading critics of Trump's immigration crackdown, signed legislation in September that would prevent ICE officers from wearing masks to hide their identities. Critics of mask-wearing say it stifles accountability.\n\nWhite House officials previously said ICE agents have experienced an increase in assaults. Over the summer, videos circulating on social media showed increasingly violent confrontations between masked federal agents and civilians seeking to document or prevent arrests.\n\nFollowing recent ICE attacks, including a deadly shooting at a facility in Dallas in September, the Department of Homeland Security announced plans to strengthen security at ICE facilities. The incidents have also raised security concerns for ICE agents, attorneys, judges, and migrants, USA TODAY previously reported.\n\nContributing: Christopher Cann and Lauren Villagran, USA TODAY; Reuters",

        "title": "US Marines investigating firing of live artillery over major California highway",
        "description": "Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of War Pete Hegseth attended an event at Camp Pendleton, commemorating the Marines' 250th anniversary.\n\nLOS ANGELES -- The U.S. Marines are investigating the firing of live artillery over a major California highway during a ceremony attended by Vice President JD Vance in which one shell blew up in the air and rained shrapnel onto police vehicles parked nearby, officials said on Oct. 20.\n\nNobody was injured in the mishap, which occurred on Oct. 18 during a demonstration of the military's M777 Howitzer heavy artillery pieces at a Camp Pendleton event celebrating the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Marine Corps.\n\nBut the incident along Interstate 5, about 40 miles north of San Diego, drew sharp criticism from California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who blamed the Trump administration for what he called a \"reckless\" and \"profoundly absurd show of force.\"\n\nThe California Highway Patrol's border division chief, Tony Coronado, a Marine veteran, labeled the mishap \"an unusual and concerning situation,\" adding that \"it is highly uncommon for any live-fire or explosive training activity to occur over an active freeway.\"\n\nThe Highway Patrol had temporarily closed down a 17-mile stretch of the I-5 freeway to traffic as a precaution in advance of the M777 exercise.\n\nBut a CHP patrol cruiser and a motorcycle that had been assigned to Vance's security detail for his arrival and were parked at a freeway on-ramp near the base during the event were showered by metal shrapnel when the first of 60 artillery shells that the Marines had planned to shoot over the freeway prematurely exploded in flight, according to a California Highway Patrol incident report shared with Reuters.\n\nA 2-inch-wide chunk of shrapnel dented the patrol car's hood, and smaller pieces rained onto and around a motorcycle, but no serious damage was detected, the report said.\n\n\"After the failed round, the exercise was terminated and no additional rounds were fired,\" the report said.\n\nCamp Pendleton did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe relatively brief closure of the I-5, which connects the Los Angeles area with San Diego County, caused traffic gridlock across the region, the Los Angeles Times reported.\n\nThe White House said on X that the Marines \"repeatedly said there are no public safety concerns with today's exercises.\"\n\nA U.S. official familiar with the situation said an investigation was underway and that Saturday's aborted Howitzer demonstration followed a \"test\" firing of 30 155-millimeter artillery shells the day before, though it was not made clear whether the Oct. 17 rounds were shot over the freeway. The Los Angeles Times reported some were.\n\nThe official said safety measures were in place on Oct. 18, and that when an artillery spotter noticed that one shell did not land where it was supposed to, a \"cease-fire was called.\"\n\n(Reporting by Steve Gorman in Los Angeles; Additional reporting by Idrees Ali in Washington; Editing by Jamie Freed)",

        "description": "Matthew Rodriguez is a digital producer for CBS Los Angeles. He's previously reported for local outlets like the Argonaut and Pasadena Weekly. Matt typically covers breaking news and crime.\n\nThe Los Angeles City Council approved a reward program on Tuesday aimed at curbing precious metal theft.\n\nIf signed by Mayor Karen Bass, the ordinance will allow the city to offer a $5,000 reward for information in felony grand theft cases and a $1,000 reward for information in misdemeanor theft investigations.\n\nIn addition to light fixtures and copper wires, the ordinance will provide a reward for information on the theft off city plaques, tombstones, statues and metals linked to the Sixth Street Bridge.\n\nThe Sixth Street Bridge in downtown Los Angeles, originally called the \"Ribbon of Light,\" is a glaring example, as it sits in darkness with seven miles of copper wire stolen and stripped from the 2023-built bridge.\n\nWhile the stolen copper is valued at $11,000, repairs to rewire it for lighting are estimated to cost over $2.5 million - and have yet to be completed.\n\nCBS News California Investigates obtained and analyzed city data and found that there have been more than 37,000 streetlight repair requests made so far in 2025. As of September, more than half are still waiting for service.\n\nThe Bureau of Street Lighting said through an email statement that 15% of the system is affected by outages. The Bureau says nearly half of its service requests are due to wire theft, and the other half are routine maintenance. This leads to a nine to 12-month period before repairs can be made, as there are fewer than 200 field staff to cover the city's quarter of a million streetlights.\n\nA report from the City Attorney's Office stated that the Los Angeles Police Department supported the ordinance, believing that it would help investigators locate suspects.\n\nCouncilman Hugo Soto-Martinez, one of the two council members who voted against the ordinance, previously argued that a lack of regular maintenance caused the outages.\n\n\"In fact, it's just regular maintenance that the city has neglected to do over the years. This should come as no surprise because we haven't assessed our street lighting funds since 1996. We've had to eliminate vacancies and so forth,\" Soto-Martinez previously said.\n\nAs an alternative, Soto-Martinez urged his colleagues to provide the Bureau of Street Lighting with more funding and personnel.\n\nAt the state level, Gov. Gavin Newsom signed Assembly Bill 476, which places greater responsibility on junk dealers when purchasing scrap metal, leaving thieves with fewer options for selling.\n\nBuyers will be required to verify the seller's identity and lawful ownership. Certain scrap metal from streetlights and traffic signals will be illegal to possess, and the bill also increases penalties for recyclers who purchase materials belonging to public entities without ensuring the seller has proper authorization.",

        "description": "More than five million people across California could see delays in their federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits if the federal shutdown continues, according to a warning from the US Department of Agriculture.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom issued a warning Monday that California residents who depend on SNAP might not see their benefits loaded on their CalFresh cards at the start of the month if the shutdown extends past Thursday.\n\nFive and a half million people get some kind of assistance every month in California to buy groceries. The majority are for low-income seniors or households with children.\n\nCBS News Bay Area talked with one recipient who says he didn't want to give us his name because he was worried his benefits might be shut off for speaking out.\n\nHe said he's working full-time and drives Uber, but it's still not enough to make ends meet.\n\n\"Two hundred and ninety-six dollars [in SNAP benefits] doesn't get you very far when you're feeding a couple of people,\" the unidentified man said, specifying that the $296 is for himself, another adult and two children, and without it, they'll have to make some tough decisions.\n\n\"Either skipping meals, or borrowing money or hoping that more money comes through,\" he said, adding he feels lucky he can drive Uber to help make up the difference, but he's frustrated. He says it's not fair that political gamesmanship is impacting real families.\n\n\"What can you do, you know? What can you do?\" he asks.\n\n\"We are absolutely on the precipice of a hunger emergency,\" said Allison Pratt with the Alameda County Community Food Bank, who expects their organization and other food banks will see a surge in people needing help if the benefits are delayed.\n\n\"SNAP is really our nation's first defense against hunger,\" Pratt said. \"So, am I going to pay rent or am I going to buy groceries this month? These are the decisions people are going to be forced to make.\"\n\nFor families already living paycheck to paycheck, recovering from a financial setback isn't easy.\n\n\"The impact is going to be for a long time here,\" said the unidentified SNAP recipient. \"I don't think we're going to recover anytime soon.\"\n\nIt's not just California that will be impacted. It's food stamp programs in every state that rely on those federal funds. Each state has its own cutoff day to reload the food stamp cards, and for California, that's on Thursday.",

A Bay Area native, Tim has been a part of the CBS Bay Area newsroom for more than two decades and joined the digital staff in 2006.\n\nA three-month crackdown on illegal cannabis grows across California has led to the seizure of more than 66 tons of cannabis plants worth more than $200 million, according to state officials.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom's office on Tuesday announced the results of 17 multi-agency operations between July and September that were conducted by the California United Cannabis Enforcement Taskforce (UCETF).\n\nDuring the operations, which took place in 15 counties across the state, 133,372 pounds of illegal cannabis was destroyed, and 234,198 plants were eradicated. The value of the illegal cannabis was estimated at more than $222 million.\n\n\"California remains committed to protecting consumers, public safety, and supporting our legal cannabis market. These enforcement actions send a clear message: Illegal operations will not be tolerated,\" Newsom said in a statement.\n\nThe largest operation of the quarter took place in Monterey County in July, as UCETF partners led by the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department dismantled what was described as a \"major\" cultivation site.\n\nFollowing the operation, the state's Department of Cannabis Control (DCC) along with state and local authorities destroyed more than 38 tons of cannabis worth more than $125 million, which officials said was \"one of the most significant cannabis enforcement efforts in state history.\n\nIn Los Angeles County, officials said an operation involving the state's Department of Fish and Wildlife led to the eradication of nearly 27,000 plants worth $22 million. Agents also arrested 20 suspects and seized toxic pesticides from China.\n\nOther counties that recorded more than 10,000 pounds of cannabis being seized during the quarter include Kern, Shasta and Alameda.\n\n\"The impact from illegal cannabis operators is real,\" said DCC director Nicole Elliott. \"These enforcement actions demonstrate continued dedication to protecting our communities and building a legal and safe cannabis market California consumers can trust.\"\n\nOfficials also noted an operation in Napa County in which California State Parks officers rescued a kidnapped child during an unrelated emergency. A suspect wanted for multiple violent felonies was arrested.\n\nIn addition to the cannabis seizures, 18 arrests were made, and 22 firearms were confiscated. The suspects were not identified.\n\nAccording to the governor's office, the task force has seized more than 325 tons of illicit cannabis products worth more than $913 million and eradicated more than 1 million cannabis plants since it was established in 2022.",

        "description": "GREENSBORO, N.C. -- North Carolina Republicans passed a new congressional map through the state legislature that would likely add one additional GOP seat in the U.S. House.\n\nSpurred on by California Gov. Gavin Newsom's threat to retaliate against Texas' redistricting, state senators on Tuesday approved their fifth redrawn map in six years.\n\nIt is the latest victory in President Trump's push to level the electoral playing field, where Democrats also carved out advantages in blue states.\n\nThus far, GOP-run Texas, Missouri and Ohio have passed redrawn maps, and some 15 additional states, both red and blue, are considering revisions to those passed after the 2020 Census.\n\n\"President Trump has called on Republican-controlled states across the country to redraw congressional districts,\" said state Sen. Ralph Hise, North Carolina Republican, who championed the new redistricting effort. \"This map answers that call.\"\n\nMr. Trump praised North Carolina's legislative initiative in a recent post on Truth Social, saying that he was \"watching, and strongly supporting, very closely.\"\n\nIn North Carolina, the seat currently held by Democrat Rep. Don Davis swung blue by just 1.8% in the last election. The new map is expected to give Republicans an 11-point advantage in that district.\n\nThree other Democrat-occupied seats in the 14-seat congressional delegation are projected to remain solid blue.\n\n\"Clearly, this new congressional map is beyond the pale,\" Mr. Davis said on social media.\n\nOther state Democrats said the redistricting was racially motivated.\n\n\"This proposed map was drawn almost entirely as an attack on Black North Carolinians and it's an attempt to remove Black representation from eastern North Carolina because they can't win in a fair fight,\" said former U.S. Rep. Wiley Nickel. \"Democrats will aggressively defend Don Davis and continue the fight for Fair Maps in federal and state courts.\"\n\nRepublican lawmakers, who hold strong majorities in both chambers of the General Assembly, said the change was long overdue.\n\nState Sen. Phil Berger, the Republican president pro tempore, pointed to the long and contentious redistricting fight with Democrats.\n\n\"We have drawn four Congressional maps in the last six years in redistricting fights with Democrats because of their sue-until-blue strategy,\" Mr. Berger said last month on X. \"If we have to draw one more map this year, we will.\"\n\nIn recent years, the Tarheel State has been ground zero for legal battles related to redistricting.\n\nIn 2019's Rucho v. Common Cause, the U.S. Supreme Court effectively punted the question of partisan gerrymandering back to the state at a time when North Carolina's high court had a slight liberal advantage.\n\nA separate SCOTUS case, 2017's Cooper v. Harris, also sided against the state's GOP legislators, forcing them to redraw maps after allegations of race-based gerrymandering.\n\nHowever, the court may soon reverse course on racial gerrymandering. Democrats fear an unfavorable outcome in the recently heard case Louisiana vs. Callais could yield a net loss of 19 congressional seats nationwide, giving the GOP a near-impenetrable majority in the U.S. House.\n\nEven if the battle is waged in state courts, Democrats could have a more difficult time than in the past because there are fewer liberal justices on the state Supreme Court.\n\nGov. Josh Stein, a Democrat, also has no power to step into the redistricting battle under the state constitution.",

Now, the case will at least proceed to oral arguments, which are likely to take place in January.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM\n\nThe trans athlete, Lindsay Hecox, started the legal battle in 2020. That year, Hecox wanted to join the women's cross-country team at Boise State, and had the state's law to prevent trans athletes from competing in women's sports blocked. Hecox was joined by an anonymous biological female student, Jane Doe, who was concerned about the potential of being subjected to the sex dispute verification process.\n\nHecox's challenge was successful, as a federal judge blocked Idaho's state law. Then a 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel upheld an injunction blocking the state law in 2023, before the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case back in July. The Supreme Court also agreed to hear a similar case in West Virginia involving a trans athlete, West Virginia v. B.P.J.\n\nHecox asked SCOTUS last month to drop the challenge, claiming the athlete \"has therefore decided to permanently withdraw and refrain from playing any women's sports at BSU or in Idaho.\"\n\nINSIDE GAVIN NEWSOM'S TRANSGENDER VOLLEYBALL CRISIS\n\nHecox's attorneys from the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), Cooley, LLP, and Legal Voice, provided a statement to Fox News Digital.\n\n\"Lindsay ended her participation in any women's athletic programs covered by HB 500 to prioritize finishing her degree at Boise State and her personal safety and wellness. Lindsay withdrew her challenge to Idaho's HB 500 and that remains unchanged. In West Virginia v. B.P.J., the U.S. Supreme Court will address a challenge to a nearly identical law. We will continue to advocate for the rights of all women and girls, including transgender women and girls. We look forward to presenting oral argument in accordance with the Court's order,\" the statement read.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nMeanwhile, Labrador previously said he hopes for the Supreme Court to cast a decision with a wider impact than just letting one state carry out its own specific law on the issue. He wants a new national precedent.\n\n\"I believe that that's what they're gonna do,\" Labrador previously told Fox News Digital in an exclusive interview. \"I think they're going to have a big ruling on whether men can participate in women's sports, and more importantly, how to determine whether transgender individuals are protected by the federal constitution and state and federal laws.\"",

        "title": "This man wants to steal your vote  --  and cement GOP minority control",
        "description": "U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice John G. Roberts poses during a group portrait. REUTERS/Evelyn Hockstein\n\nAmerica is at war over partisan gerrymandering. The Republican-controlled Texas legislature has just gerrymandered voting districts to create five more safe Republican US House seats, as demanded by Donald Trump.\n\nThen Missouri Republicans were ordered by Trump to enact a gerrymander to increase the states' disproportionate Republican minority from 6-2 to 7-1 by cutting Democratic-leaning Kansas City districts down the middle. Now Vice President JD Vance is urging Indiana Republicans to gerrymander the only two remaining Democratic House districts out of existence.\n\nIn response, California Governor Gavin Newsom has proposed a ballot measure that would temporarily suspend California's independent redistricting commission until 2030 and let the Democratic legislature redistrict Republicans out of five seats to match what Republicans have done in Texas.\n\nA large majority of voters nationally don't think partisan gerrymandering should be legal. According to a recent YouGov poll, 69 percent of Americans think partisan gerrymandering should be illegal and only 9 percent think it should be legal.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts (and all of his Republican colleagues on the Supreme Court) disagree with this vast majority of Americans. In 2019, Roberts' 5-4 majority opinion in Rucho v Common Cause (the chief joined by the four other Republicans on the Court) held that federal courts do not have the constitutional power to prevent partisan gerrymandering and restored blatantly partisan gerrymanders in North Carolina and Maryland.\n\nSince Roberts' decision, partisan gerrymandering has exploded. According to Michael Li of the Brennan Center, partisan gerrymandering has given Republicans 16 extra seats in the House. Without that, Democrats would have a House majority and Republicans would not have been able to pass the so-called \"big beautiful bill\" which has led to a government shutdown.\n\nAs the Brennan Center states, \"Gerrymandering decided House control.\"\n\nRoberts' opinion conceded that partisan gerrymandering is \"incompatible with democratic institutions\" and \"leads to results that reasonably seem unjust.\" But Roberts then invented a procedural technicality to bar federal courts from doing anything about it or to uphold the Constitutional principle of \"one person, one vote.\"\n\nRoberts claimed that partisan gerrymandering is a so-called \"political question\" that federal courts have no right to answer and must be left to the states.\n\nOf course, when one party controls the state legislature, they have every incentive to draw voting districts to guarantee they never lose political power, no matter what the view of the voters is. Voters don't get to pick their own legislators. Instead, legislators get to pick their voters.\n\nIn her dissent in Rucho -- joined by Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor, and Stephen Breyer -- Justice Eleanor Kagan wrote:\n\n\"For the first time ever, this court refuses to remedy a constitutional violation because [Roberts] thinks the task is beyond judicial capabilities. And not just any constitutional violation. The partisan gerrymanders in these cases deprived citizens of the most fundamental of their constitutional rights: the right participate equally in the political process, to join with others to advance their political beliefs, and to choose their political representatives. In so doing, the partisan gerrymanders here debased and dishonored our democracy ... enabl[ing] politicians to entrench themselves in office as against voters' preferences ... They encouraged a politics of polarization and disfunction.\"\n\nIs it any wonder that a New York Times/Siena poll taken last week found that only 33 percent of voters believe that America's political system can still address the nation's problems, while 64 percent believe the political system is too politically divided to solve the nation's problems?\n\nAs former Senate Judiciary Committee counsel Lisa Graves argues in a new book, \"[I]n the last 20 years the US Supreme Court has radically curtailed voting rights, undermined anti-corruption measures, encouraged extreme political gerrymandering, restricted the regulation of guns, and obliterated the constitutional right to control one's reproductive choices. This transformation was orchestrated by a billionaire-backed reactionary political movement, whose interests Chief Justice John Roberts has been all too willing to serve.\"\n\nCitizens have no power to overturn a US Supreme Court decision. However, California citizens have the ability to equalize Texas Republicans' gerrymander of five House seats.\n\nOn Nov. 4, they can pass Proposition 50 which lets the state legislature temporarily draw new congressional district maps through 2030, at which point the Independent Citizens Redistricting Commission would resume control of redistricting, and supports nonpartisan redistricting commissions nationwide.\n\nIt won't completely block Roberts' 20-year project to undermine democracy and judicially enact the increasingly MAGA Republican agenda. (It wouldn't be an exaggeration to call it a \"judicial coup\".)\n\nIndeed, last week, SCOTUS heard oral arguments in a case where it appears that Roberts will lead the Republican majority to overturn Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act which protects the right of Black voters to have electoral representation. Such a ruling could likely flip as many as 19 House seats from Democratic to Republican, cementing a Republican House majority for the foreseeable future, regardless of the will of the voters.\n\nPassing Proposition 50 is one thing Californians can do to fight back against Justice Roberts' undemocratic judicial campaign, which has helped enable Trump's authoritarianism. Mail-in ballots have already been sent out so California voters can cast \"Yes\" votes for Proposition 50 from now until Nov. 4.\n\nBeyond that, thanks to John Roberts and his Republican colleagues on SCOTUS, other blue states will have to be brought into the gerrymander wars and enact their own partisan gerrymanders, to balance Republican gerrymanders to the extent possible.",

        "title": "New California laws tackle AI, immigration, wildfires and more. Here's what to know about bills signed by Newsom",
        "description": "Dean Fioresi is a web producer for CBS Los Angeles. He covers breaking news throughout Southern California. When he's not writing about local events, he enjoys focusing on sports and entertainment.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom signed hundreds of bills into law this year, taking action on legislation sent to his desk by state lawmakers aimed at addressing some of California's most pressing issues, such as immigration, wildfire recovery and insurance.\n\nHere's what to know about California's new laws and how they could affect you.\n\nIn September, Newsom signed several bills while visiting Los Angeles aimed at enhancing protections for residents affected by ongoing immigration enforcement operations. Among the legislation was Senate Bill 627, called the \"No Secret Police Act,\" which prohibits most local, state and federal law enforcement officers from wearing face coverings while on duty. It also calls for all officers to be identifiable by name and badge number.\n\nA pair of bills, Assembly Bill 49 and Senate Bill 98, provide protections for students amid immigration enforcement operations conducted at schools.\n\nAB 49 prohibits school officials and employees from allowing federal agents conducting immigration enforcement to enter school sites without a warrant, court order or judicial subpoena. SB 98 requires schools to notify parents, teachers, administrators and school personnel of the confirmed presence of immigration enforcement agents and activity on school campuses.\n\nNewsom signed a package of bills on Oct. 10 that he said will \"support the ongoing rebuilding and recovery efforts in Los Angeles after the devastating fires earlier this year.\"\n\nThe legislation signed by Newsom aims to protect homeowners and tenants following a disaster; provide property tax relief for survivors; help workers recover; make insurance work more efficiently for property owners and small business owners; crack down on looting and fire responder impersonation; and reduce further risk of catastrophic wildfire.\n\nThe bipartisan package will also provide additional resources for the state's response and recovery for future disasters. Signed bills include:\n\nThe sale of new Glock handguns will stop in California under Assembly Bill 1127, but the guns won't be illegal to possess or to purchase used.\n\nThe legislation was aimed at addressing the use of \"Glock switches,\" which were already banned in the state but are now easily accessible through 3-D printing. The small switches enable the guns to be modified into fully automatic weapons.\n\nAB 1127 was passed by the California Legislature on a party-line vote, with all Republican assembly members in opposition.\n\nCo-pays on insulin in California will be capped at $35 for 30-day supplies after Newsom signed Senate Bill 40.\n\nAccording to the bill, about 263,000 Californians have type 1 diabetes and rely on daily doses of insulin. Many of the 4 million Californians with type 2 diabetes also need the doses. About one in four insulin users have reported under-usage due to the high costs.\n\nCalRX, the state's program to develop and sell its own prescription medications, will be able to sell the low-cost insulin pens beginning Jan. 1, 2026.\n\nFour bills signed in October are aimed at cracking down on puppy mills and protecting dogs and cats alike.\n\nThree of the bills, AB 506, AB 519 and SB 312, implement new regulations aimed at holding pet sellers accountable by prohibiting third-party pet brokers and requiring dog importers to submit health certificates to the California Department of Food and Agriculture shortly after shipping a pet.\n\nAB 867 bans declawing cats when not medically necessary.\n\n\"Greater transparency in pet purchases will bring to light abusive practices that take advantage of pets in order to exploit hopeful pet owners,\" Newsom said in a statement.\n\nSenate Bill 19 makes it a crime to threaten daycares, schools, universities, workplaces, houses of worship or medical facilities.\n\nThe new law amends existing California law that criminalizes credible threats, clarifying that threats to those facilities are criminal even if a specific person isn't identified.\n\nSenate Bill 576 prohibits streaming services from increasing the volume of commercials above the level of a television show or movie that someone is watching.\n\nFederal law already bans broadcasters from running overly loud commercials, but streaming services were not around when the federal Commercial Advertisement Loudness Mitigation Act was passed in 2010.\n\nSenate Bill 53 targets large artificial intelligence models and implements a number of transparency, reporting and safety requirements that developers must follow in the state.\n\n\"California has proven that we can establish regulations to protect our communities while also ensuring that the growing AI industry continues to thrive,\" Newsom said in a statement after signing the first-in-the-nation bill.\n\nNewsom also signed a package of legislation aimed at protecting children online. New laws include creating protocols for AI chatbots to identify suicidal tendencies in users and requiring companies to clarify that their AI companions are not health care professionals.\n\nApp stores and operating systems must now require age verification for users on products deemed \"inappropriate\" or \"dangerous.\" Under new California law, third parties that knowingly generate or distribute \"deepfake\" pornography may now be held liable in civil court.\n\nAssembly Bill 56 requires warning labels for social media platforms in an effort to warn young users about the downsides of extended usage of those sites.\n\nAssembly Bill 656 forces social media companies to make it straightforward and simple for users to delete their accounts.\n\nAccount cancellations will also delete all personal data from the site's database.\n\nIn an effort to help address California's high housing costs, Newsom signed Senate Bill 79, which allows for more housing construction near major transit stations. Proponents of the bill say that the legislation will also help increase ridership, reduce traffic and pollution, and expand access to jobs and schools.\n\n\"For too long, California has poured billions into transit without building the housing density needed for those systems to reach their potential,\" Newsom said.\n\nAssembly Bill 1264 makes California the first state in the nation to ban ultra-processed food from public school lunches.\n\nLimits on sugars, fats and calories in food items will go into place, as well as bans on certain dyes, including Red 40.\n\n\"For too many students, the meals they receive at school are the only ones they can count on in a day, which makes the quality of that food all the more important,\" First Partner Jennifer Siebel Newsom said. \"By removing the most concerning ultra-processed foods, we're helping children stay nourished, focused, and ready to learn.\"\n\nSenate Bill 518 moves California one step closer toward issuing reparations to descendants of enslaved persons.\n\nThe law establishes the Bureau for Descendants of American Slavery, which is eligible to receive state and federal funding within the Civil Rights Department. The bill states that the bureau's Genealogy Division would then \"verify an individual's status as a descendant.\"\n\nThe law stops short of authorizing the bureau to hand out cash reparations. The state is still determining how to \"address the lasting harms of disenfranchisement, segregation, discrimination, exclusion neglect, and violence impacting both descendants and communities,\" according to the bill's text.\n\nA 19-bill package of bipartisan legislation signed by Newsom is aimed at reducing costs and protecting families by creating stronger consumer protections. The bills signed into law include:\n\nSeveral other bills signed by Newsom specifically aim to protect tenants, including:\n\nAssembly Bill 1340 allows rideshare drivers with services including Lyft and Uber to form a union and negotiate a contract while still being labeled as independent contractors.\n\nIt requires the app-based companies to negotiate with union members in good faith.\n\nProponents of Senate Bill 42 and Senate Bill 398 say the legislation is aimed at protecting California elections against interference from what Newsom called a \"sweepstakes from billionaires seeking to buy elections.\"\n\nSB 42 puts a measure on the November 2026 ballot to repeal a ban on public financing of elections, providing California cities and counties the ability to create publicly financed election programs. Proponents say that it will level the playing field for candidates and reduce the ability to \"buy elections,\" according to the governor's office. SB 398 criminalizes offering payments or valuables to incentivize voters. The crime would be punishable by imprisonment, a fine, or both.\n\nSenate Bill 27 expands the CARE Act, which provides court-ordered services and treatments for those with mental illnesses. The new guidelines force judges to consider CARE Court as a \"frontline option\" for those convicted of misdemeanors who suffer from mental illness as a way to keep them out of the criminal justice system.\n\nA legislative package intended to increase the quality of life for California women includes new regulations on products commonly used by women, such as hair and menstrual products and prenatal vitamins. The legislation signed by Newsom also aims to increase access for women to alternative birth centers.\n\n\"Women in California deserve to have access to quality health care, child care support, and safer products for everyday use,\" Newsom said. \"I'm proud to sign these bills that will continue to address the needs of Californian women and move the needle towards gender equity.\"\n\nUnder Assembly Bill 727, student ID cards at public middle schools, high schools and colleges will be required to display the phone number for The Trevor Project, which provides a 24/7 suicide and crisis hotline for LGBTQ+ youth. This new law expands the state's partnership with The Trevor Project, which has assisted California's own crisis hotline staff with specialized training.\n\nUnder Senate Bill 640, many students can skip the stress of waiting for an acceptance letter to 16 of the 22 California State University campuses.\n\nAs long as high school seniors achieve a 2.0 grade point average and take mandatory \"a-g\" courses, they'll be eligible for admission to the schools under the new law.\n\nThe participating schools are CSU Bakersfield; CSU Channel Islands; Chico State; CSU Dominguez Hills; Cal State East Bay; Fresno State; Cal Poly Humboldt; Cal State LA; Cal State Monterey Bay; CSU Northridge; Sacramento State; Cal State San Bernardino; San Francisco State; Cal State San Marcos; Sonoma State; and Stanislaus State.\n\nStudents who want to attend Cal State Fullerton, CSU Long Beach, Cal Poly Maritime Academy, San Diego State, San Jose State and Cal Poly San Luis Obispo are not automatically accepted with these requirements, and must apply using traditional methods.",

        "title": "Video: Opinion | The Rural Power Behind Trump's Assault on Blue Cities",
        "description": "The political scientist Suzanne Mettler examines the roots of America's urban-rural divide and how Democrats can win back rural voters.\n\nI think there's a particular lens worth using right now as we watch the Trump administration deploying the National Guard from red states into blue cities. We are watching a rural political coalition militarily occupying urban centers. It is moving armed troops in over the objections of the residents, of their mayors and of their governors. This is an attack on neighborhoods, on lawful residents, on U.S. citizens. That's not preventing crime, as Donald Trump claims, that's threatening public safety. The Trump administration is doing this while describing these cities as something like enemy territory. They need to be liberated, taken back. Trump said this to a room of America's top military leaders. What they've done to San Francisco, Chicago, New York, Los Angeles, they're very unsafe places. And we're going to straighten them out one by one. That's a war, too. It's a war from within. Trump also said that the people in these cities resisting this occupation, these deployments, that they should be understood as insurrectionists. We have an Insurrection Act for a reason. If I had to enact it, I'd do that. If people were being killed and courts were holding us up, or governors or mayors were holding us up. Sure, I'd do that. For years, I have been skeptical of warnings that America was at risk of a renewed Civil War. There were all kinds of reasons to not take that particularly seriously. But when I see troops being sent into cities over the objections of the people elected in those cities, of the people elected in those states. When I hear them talked about this way, I think you have to take those warnings more seriously now. And I told Pete we should use some of these dangerous cities as training grounds for our military National Guard. But military. A massive rural urban divide has opened in our country's politics. Urban and rural voters used to vote pretty much in lockstep. But then in the 90s, that split. Urban voters became reliably Democratic, and rural voters became overwhelmingly Republican. We treat this as an inevitability in our politics, but it is only a few decades old, and our political future and stability might rest on reversing it. Certainly, for the Democratic Party, any durable political power rests on reversing it. Reversing it isn't going to be easy, but it begins with understanding it and taking seriously the resentments that fuel it. \"Rural Versus Urban\", a new book by the political scientist Suzanne Mettler and Trevor Brown, is the best place I've found to start. And so I asked Mettler to join me on the show, to walk me through how we got here and whether we can get out. As always, my email. Nytimes.com Suzanne Mettler, welcome to the show. Happy to be here. I think a lot of people who have followed politics over the past 10, 20 years. Assume the big political divide between rural America and urban America is a constant, an inevitability, just a feature of our politics. Is that true. No the rural urban divide did not exist nationwide in the past in the United States. If we look at how people voted in presidential elections through the middle of the 20th century, right up to the early 90s, rural and urban Americans voted, almost in lockstep, just a couple of percentage points dividing them. That's true as recently as 1992. Two percentage point gap. Then it starts growing and growing and growing. And it was in 2020 for a 20 percentage point gap. All regions of the country have moved in this way, have this big gap. Almost all states have a big rural urban divide. And, it's really driving polarization in a particularly pernicious way because it's place based. Rural and urban people don't encounter each other in ways that could soften the divide. And so it's creating an us versus them kind of politics that's really dangerous. Before we get into what created the divide beginning in the 90s, what kept urban and rural America politically United for so long. Well you go back to say that, the late early 20th century, as industrialization is happening, rural areas really feel left behind. There's a big agricultural depression in the 1920s. Then the depression comes, and rural people at that point are really upset and policymakers are worried. There's about to be like a revolution in the countryside, as they call it. But what happens is that Franklin D Roosevelt steps in and he creates this big rural urban Coalition and to an extent that I was unaware of until we wrote this book. He really put rural Americans front and center in his vision of what needed to happen for the country, and created all of these policies that were really designed to lift up rural America. I cannot escape the conclusion that one of the essential parts of a national program of restoration must be to restore purchasing power to the farming half of the country. Without this, the wheels of the railroad and the wheels of the factories will not turn. Rural Americans really appreciated that, and they felt the Democratic Party was there for them, and many of them remembered it for their lifetimes. And then their kids did as well, all the way up until the 1990s. In the 1980s and early 90s, rural places were more likely to send Democrats to Congress and Republicans and to think that a few decades ago, there was still really a coalition where there were rural politicians who were really at the forefront in Congress in brokering compromises on all sorts of important policies. When we study the Affordable Care Act, for example, you have all of these rural lawmakers who were really playing an important role. And influencing the policy right up till the end, and those lawmakers are gone. Bart Stupak, for example, who was a swing vote from the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. And he gets replaced by people who are like Marjorie Taylor Greene going forward. So it moves from being these people who are functionally moderating polarization in America, who are building bridges. Stupak is a pro-life Democrat, very famously Ben Nelson from Nebraska, the same thing to. The most extreme members of the Republican coalition. You have a thing towards the end of the book where you show that if you're looking at Republicans who was likeliest to support the lies about the 2020 election, it is heavily overrepresented by the Republicans who represent rural districts. Yes, that's right. So on January 6, 2021, when Congress reconvenes, there's a large portion of the Republican caucus, about 138 members who vote against accepting the votes from all of the states. And they're heavily rural. It's not just that these folks who are being elected in rural areas now are more conservative on policy issues, is that it's also that they are more willing to go against basic Democratic norms and principles. In 1964, Lyndon Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act into law. And that kicks off this process of ideological polarization where the parties into liberal and conservative. The Dixiecrats die out. And I think the most commonly believed story about what happened in the urban rural divide is that they hated the Civil Rights Act. I think if you look at a lot of Democratic accounts of this, you'll see something like that. You don't buy that account. Yeah, well that's wrong. So, for one thing, just look at when the rural urban divide emerged. It's not until the late 1990s. So the story that you're telling usually then the follow up is that the South left the Democratic Party. Well, in fact, it was a lot of urban Southerners who left the Democratic Party. But rural Southerners stuck with it up until the 1990s. And then they left one of the most striking things that we find is that this rural urban divide is not a function of differences in views about public policy. And so we look exhaustively at public opinion polls and we find that on most issues, if you look at the views of non-Hispanic white Americans, there's no difference, no significant difference in their opinions about how much we should be spending money on things like education, health care, policing. And so on. There are a few issues abortion and gun rights where there's a gap, but the gap is not that large and it hasn't been growing over time. So it doesn't explain this growing rural urban divide. So in other words, while we are divided by place in terms of which party people support, that's not because there's a difference in Americans actual views in those two places on major issues. So then why are people in rural America electing representatives who are so different on policy to the people they used to elect. What we find is that when the rural urban divide began to grow in the 1990s, it was economic factors that were driving it. And so you'd had economic decline that was happening starting in the 1980s. Loss of family farms with agricultural consolidation, loss of jobs in extractive industries like mining and oil and the. And then deindustrialization, which had already been hitting cities pretty hard. Then it hits with NAFTA and change in trade policies. It hits rural areas to an extent. That really surprised me. I wouldn't have realized there was so much industry in rural places. So that's in the late 90s, early 2000. And as all of that's happening, rural people start to feel that this party that they had long thought was there for them or they were at least willing to support, on occasion, vote, split ticket, whatever. They start to feel like it's abandoned them and that it's no longer there for them. I think it's a factor that Bill Clinton is President during that point in time. So even though most Democrats in Congress were opposed to NAFTA and opposed to a lot of deregulation, that was happening, there were just enough Democrats endorsing it and then Bill Clinton signing it into law. And so rural people moved away from the Democratic Party and started supporting the Republican Party. So let me push on some parts of this story. You one thing that your book really did convince me of is that if you look at the timing of different things, the political divergence and the economic divergence really do track each other. But as you say, a lot of the policies people often blame here, not just NAFTA. There were a lot of free trade policies. There was a lot of deregulation. Deregulation is a big focus of your book. They're heavily supported by Republicans to say nothing of taxes that are cut for rich people. And then the spending cuts fall on programs that people in rural America use very heavily. Obamacare, in very important ways, subsidizes a lot of health. And rural America helps hospitals there, helps people who are uninsured there. The thing I was thinking as I was reading your book was that there is what happens, and then there is who is blamed for what happens and where something happened that could plausibly be blamed on Democrats. You see it blamed on them. Why Well, I think you're putting your finger on why this is so puzzling and paradoxical. So I said, it starts with the economic stuff. But then the second phase is the development of resentment. 2008 to 2020. Then at that point, rural Americans are looking at the Democratic Party, and they start to think of it as having a center that is affluent people, wealthy people, people better off than themselves who are running the party and who don't seem to understand them or their communities, but they're creating policies that they're foisting upon them in all sorts of different areas, and they resent it. So that's when grievance begins to grow. So there's this sense of anger, and it has become channeled at the Democratic Party, even though that is in many ways unfair. But I think it is true now that much of the Democratic Party, because it's become so distant from rural voters, doesn't understand their situation and their communities. And so there is a basis in fact, there in 2008, when George W Bush is incredibly unpopular, the Iraq war is understood to be a disaster. The financial crisis is in full swing. Obama and the Democrats do quite well in rural America. I mean, it's one of the last times on some of your charts when you see the cities and the rural areas swing together. Yes but then there's I mean, the first bailout passes under George W Bush, but the Democrats support it. The recovery from the financial crisis is slow, and it is slower in rural America. There is a feeling that the banks got bailed out. The cities ended up doing fine. The stock market comes back, but the devastation in rural America really lingers. How much did you hear about that and how much do you think that soured people in these areas on the Democratic Party in a kind of final fashion. One of the things we did for our research was interviewing political party County chairs, both Democrats and Republicans in several states. I drove thousands of miles and talked to a lot of people. I remember one County chair saying to us, we've been in a recession here for 30 years. So I think in a sense, it's all been kind of a blur from the loss of jobs that was happening in the 1990s and early 2000. As plants closed and and workforces downsized to then what happens in 2008 and beyond with the Great Recession that things went from bad to worse. How much is this just educational polarization that what you're seeing is the cities are much more highly educated, a greater density of college graduates. How much is the urban rural language simply obscuring the main issue being the educational divide. Yeah well, the educational divide certainly plays into it and is very important. It's fascinating. You go back to the 1980s and the average person with a college degree or more in the United States voted for the Republican Party. And then that changes in starting in the 90s, that group starts moving toward the Democratic Party. And these are urbanites with higher education. And it's not until 2008 and beyond that, rural people start to emulate that same pattern. But they're it the average rural person has less education. And then the switch that's happening is from the Democratic Party to the Republican Party. So the educational divide is important. But in all of our analysis, we control for that. And rurality still matters. It matters over and above that there being a coalition that is more urban and a coalition that is more rural, and the rural coalition being particularly more culturally conservative, more religious, more traditionalist. That's a pretty common structure for political systems. We see this same divergence in many countries. Does that imply there's something if not inevitable, then heavily predetermined here. Given that it's happening in different countries with different political parties who have passed different economic policies at different times. Typically other countries have more parties than we do. And the rural urban divide, while it has grown in lots of countries in the past few decades, it's grown most dramatically in the United States. And here I'm turning to the work of Jonathan Rodden at Stanford. He's done a lot of work on this. It's grown more quickly here during that time period. And I would also add that it's more consequential in the United States because we have so many of our electoral institutions give extra political power to less populated places. So if you think of the US Senate, for example, every state gets two senators, regardless of population. So California has more than 60 times as many residents as Wyoming. But they both have two senators. And that gets replicated in all these other rural states. And that means that in the Senate, when it comes to policymaking, that rural places have extra cloud. It also means that in choosing the judiciary, confirmations of judges, that the rural urban divide matters a lot. And, of course, the electoral college. So right now, for the first time in our history, all of these advantages are consolidated in one party. And that hasn't been the case before. So I very much by that point that it is more consequential here because of the somewhat distinctive place based structure of our political system. But I want to hold on this question of what the commonality across countries might teach us or might not teach us. I think a lot of Democrats believe something very similar to what Barack Obama said in the infamous bitter Clinger comments. People have been beaten down so long and they feel so betrayed by government. So it's not surprising then, that they get bitter and they cling to guns or religion or antipathy toward people who aren't like them, or a way to explain their frustrations. And if you wipe the argument he made of some the more condescending language it was in it, I think, very much to his regret. What he says is something like this rural America is seeing in rural places, in a much more globalized, digitized knowledge based economy, are seeing their economies weaken. That is true across countries. And the people who stay there. They stay there for a number of different reasons. They want to be where they grew up. They are more traditionalist, and as both the people who can leave and want to leave do, and as the people who can stay and want to say stay have less and less economic dynamism and you have more identification with the way things used to be with a better time from before. And that goes alongside more religiosity. It goes alongside more traditional ways of life hunting, and it comes with a resentment of the urban elites who you feel are doing this to you and who don't respect your way of life. I'm not saying this is true, but I'm presenting it as a thing I think Democrats believe is true. So there's a lot of stereotypes there. And so I grew up in a rural place myself, and I still spend a lot of time in rural places. So I think if a lot of rural Americans heard this, they would really want to push back and say, no, we're not part of some entirely different sect of people over here. There are lots and lots of rural Americans who do identify as Democrats. It tends to be about one third on average. Now in presidential elections. And then there are many other Americans who's in rural places, whose ideas are in flux, just like those elsewhere. You're suggesting there's a political sorting going on that the people move away who have these different policy attitudes or different. I've heard it phrased as psychological attitudes. People with more openness to experience, people who want to compete in the urban job markets, that there is a sorting happening. Yeah now there's other scholars than ourselves who've looked at this very carefully, and they find that that's not driving rural people's moving to urban places and that in fact, when people change their party, it tends to be after they've made a move. So it's not pulling them to urban places. So I don't think that holds up. And you've been talking a bit about the rise of grievance politics and resentment. I think there's something upstream of that which you talk about a bit in the book, but is affinity. And I just don't think there's a way to get around this. I've been covering politics and particularly Democratic politics since the early 2000, and the Democratic Party is an urban Coalition, and it does in many ways feel distant from rural America. I mean, I remember in that George W Bush years all the talk about losing touch with the heartland, right. Democrats were the party of John Kerry and coastal liberals and Republicans were the party of the heartland. And Democrats losing touch on gods, guns and gays was the way it used to be talked about. And it seems, for reasons that aren't primarily policy, but might have to do with religiosity and other things there developed just more affinity. I mean, there are elites in both parties, and the elites in both parties are educated, and the elites in both parties are rich. And often the elites in both parties come from or live in cities. And yet the elites in the Democratic Party much more identify with urban America than the elites in the Republican Party. Even when the elites in the Republican Party like Donald Trump, live in New York City. And that affinity feels very important in terms of everything that comes after. Yes well, I think that they are you're really explaining the second dynamic that we identify, this sense that rural people have that of elite overreach coming from the Democrats and that Democrats don't understand them. So I think that's a real thing. And I agree with you. What I would say for the Democratic Party is that unless it can overcome that, it's going to be a minority party. It's not going to win back the Senate again until it can overcome the rural urban divide. It's going to have very challenging time, getting a very big margin in the House. It's going to be challenged in presidential elections and in many state level elections. And that's consequential just in so many ways. So I mean, it's problematic for the country. It means that also for rural people that they are subjected to one party government in so many places. If the Democratic Party just decides to throw up our hands, we're not going to go organize in rural places, which is what's been happening. It's really problematic for democracy at so many levels. The way your book is structured, you say there's this economic divergence and then layered on top of that very quickly is what you call elite overreach. And that's what we're talking about here. And the way you describe it is that quote, it was not any one issue that tipped the scales, but rather the persistent commonality that ran across him. From 2008 onward, rural Americans perceived an urban elite that sought to impose itself on far flung places, controlling residents' lives through New rules and procedures in which they felt they had little voice. And you argue that the issue here was not the policy, but the sense of. Respect or disrespect, of listening or not listening. Of representation or absence of representation. That there was something beneath policy that drove this. Tell me about that. That sense of we are being ruled from afar. Yeah that's right. It's illustrated. We illustrate it in the book through a couple of different policy areas. And one is renewable energy, which actually you might find interesting because of the ideas that you explore in abundance. So there's a fascinating literature of scholars have looked at many different parts of the country. And when wind and solar comes into rural places, which is, of course, where the land is and where you need to develop it, it so often happens without rural communities having a chance to have a voice. So there'll be a big developer that comes in a company that, cuts a deal with a big landowner. And all of this happens and agreements are made before the local community hears about it. And then people are upset. And as what scholars have found who study very carefully public opinion on environmental issues, and we do as well that there's not a big difference between rural and urban Americans, in their view on environmental issues. And in fact, a lot of rural people care very deeply about the environment because the land is so important to them, and yet they feel that the process is really problematic. There's one study that was about wind farms in Indiana and to quote a person in that they quoted, they said, it's not that I'm against wind energy. I'm against how it was done. Here I found this raised a lot of skepticism for me. I mean, first, I'm not against x where x is clean energy, affordable housing, mass transit. I'm just against how it was done. Here is I feel the most common structure of I'm against x, but in abundance. As you note, I spend a lot of time talking about and researching and reporting on how clean energy projects in particular are sited in different parts of the country. And what I can say for sure is that red states cite different forms, all kinds of different forms of energy, much more easily than blue states do, because they have much less complex and deliberative procedures for siting them. If you want to build a wind farm in Texas, in rural Texas, it is just much easier than building it in rural California or rural New York. And yet, rural Americans are not turning against the government of Texas for the lack of deliberative, consultative, and veto oriented siting. So something about that felt off to me because I would think that would then lead to much more anger in red states, where it is much easier to just plow through a new development than it is in blue states, which have, again, much more veto oriented structures here. It's very interesting that it's been easier for Republican governors to roll out these policies. And I would love to look under the hood and find out the dynamics that are happening there. But we don't do that in our book. What I would say is that it's problematic to have people in cities who accuse rural people of NIMBYism when renewable energy is needed, particularly by urban people. And so this can be a really extractive kind of industry that just is one more thing that where rural people are taken advantage of and where their needs are not taken into account. I'm getting at something even a little bit larger here than clean energy. One thing that your book just seems to accept, and even talk about is that the attribution of blame for policy is very, very muddy, and it relies a lot on how people get their information and whether they get their information. You talk about a particular study where Republican policies close rural hospitals and people are mad, and Republican vote share goes up in the next election because people blame the party they already don't like. I could tell a story where people don't like the renewable energy coming in, and even though it's coming in more aggressively in red states because of their procedures, nobody knows that much about siting rules. So they're still blaming the party they see as connected to renewable energy. But there's something here about how many of the policies that you describe as particularly painful or destructive or irritating to rural America are not promulgated by Democrats, but Democrats get blamed anyway. Yes no. That's true. And politics is full of paradox. What's going on there. And we argue, is that there's another component of our explanation that I haven't gotten to talk about yet. And that is the organizational component here. The question is, who is on the ground in a place connecting the dots for voters, saying to them, here's what's happening in public policy, and here's how it matters for our community. Here's the party that is best representing your interests and values. Doing that, connecting of the dots. So political parties need to do this for people. And so in rural places, the Democratic Party has become very weak. And so it's much harder for them to really be there making the case. And then the Republican Party for the same kinds of reasons that all civic organizations have suffered over time, has had challenging times as well. And yet, it has been helped by other organizations that are prevalent in rural places. So we find that evangelical churches are more occur on a greater per capita basis in rural places, and so do gun groups affiliated with the National Rifle Association. And so those groups have been playing a supportive role to the Republican Party in helping to connect the dots for voters and to get out the vote, essentially. Democrats used to be aided by labor unions in rural places. And that's really been decimated very much with deindustrialization. I want to actually spend a moment on the media side of this. I've talked to Democratic politicians. Barack Obama said this to me once who say that they felt able to run in rural areas in 2000 or 2000 and 8 or 1996, but as depending on the place we're talking about as talk radio and Rush Limbaugh took hold. Then later as Fox News rolled out. Now we have social media and all these other partisan and hyperpolarized forms of information that they don't even feel they can get a hearing because the people who are interested in politics, what they are hearing is so angry at Democrats and so polarized that there's no way to get around it. Well, I have no doubt that the Media Matters. And so in our analysis, we do all this quantitative analysis. And we were limited to the things that we could where we had data for all counties over these many decades. And we didn't have a way to measure the rise of talk radio. Rush Limbaugh and where are people listening to it. And Fox News and the loss of local newspapers and all of these important changes in the media. And I'm sure they're important. But this is where Democratic Party organizing is so needed. And crucial. And I remember County chair in Southern Ohio saying, look, there's no one here shouting from the rooftops back against Fox News. They're lying to you. And so whether it's the media or organizations, that's the problem, that in rural places people aren't hearing another message very strongly. Political scientists use, I always think the slightly strange tool, the feelings thermometer, where they ask people to rate other groups on a one to 100 scale, and you have this data for white rural Americans. And on a scale of 1 to 100, they put Black Americans at a 70. So pretty good. Hispanic Americans at 67. Gay men at 57. Illegal immigrants at 39. Pretty low. And Democrats at 14 points. So Democrats are rated about actually I mean less well, less than half as highly as illegal immigrants. By the way, this is not just a rural America. White urban Democrats put Republicans at 17 points, but the hatred is much more concentrated at the political outgroup, at least in these measures, than at any other group. Exactly Yeah. So the way we sum this up, if you think of what I was saying earlier about public policy issues and how we don't differ very much rural and urban Americans on these issues, we barely disagree, but we are bitterly divided and the divide is over partisanship. So in other words, it doesn't have to be this way. It's teams, it's tribalism, but it's not based in really different views about issues. But it does create then these self-reinforcing dynamics. But it creates anger. I mean, I think about the soft version is maybe Barack Obama's bitter clingers comment. The harder version is Hillary Clinton's deplorables comment. It creates I mean, I remember this so strongly from the Bush era, and I see it now when Republicans are in power. Urban liberals do feel threatened do feel like that power is being deployed against them, do feel very angry at what is being done. And then it creates political strategy. Because parties work with limited resources, they have to choose where to put their energy and their attention. In 2016, Chuck Schumer famously says, for every blue collar Democrat we lose in Western Pennsylvania, we will pick up two moderate Republicans in the suburbs in Philadelphia. And you can repeat that in Ohio and Illinois and Wisconsin. Now, whether you can repeat that is, I guess, a reasonable question to ask. But you do see the Democratic Party begin to say to itself, we've lost rural America throwing good money after bad. There is not worth doing. Let's try to pick up the suburbs. How do you think about that. Both as a matter of short term and long term political strategy. It's a losing strategy given what I was saying earlier about the electoral institutions in the United States. A party has to be able to win less populated places if it wants to have national power. FDR really understood this, and contemporary politicians don't. It's not the same to pick up those suburban voters. You need to be picking up rural voters. So it's crucial to build that bridge because otherwise you know you're not going to win the Senate. The electoral college is an uphill battle. And then when it comes to house districts, we might think, oh, well, that's not so much an issue. Well, it is because Democratic votes are wasted in effect, because they're consolidated in densely populated places. And so Republican voters tend to be much more evenly distributed across the landscape. So it's much easier for Republicans to draw districts that favor them than for Democrats to do so. It would be good if you could do that. But I guess the question I don't want to put any words in Chuck Schumer's mouth, but that I would hear from Democrats is can you. One thing you have in the book is quite a few Democrats who used to win rural areas, saying, I couldn't win that today. Bob kerrey, who was a very successful politician in Nebraska, runs again in Nebraska later on loses easily. Bill Clinton says now, quite a long time ago, I don't know that I could win in Arkansas anymore. There are a pretty small handful of Democrats. Jared Golden in Maine, Marie Gluesenkamp Perez in Washington, who now run in and win pretty rural areas. So while, Yes, you're of course, given the structure of the American political system, that it would be better if you could have a mixed geographic coalition, is it actually possible or do you just have to work from a place of futility? No, it's not futile. But what it takes is a long term strategy of deep, full time, year round organizing and listening to rural Americans. Other parties like to put a focus on messaging. Messaging is very surface level, and it does not have enduring effects. But organizing really matters. And an illustration of this. We were talking earlier about Congress the basic pattern from 1994 to the present is that rural places have elected Republicans. But in the middle of that time, things went in a different way. And that was when Howard Dean became the head of the Democratic National Committee, 2005 through 2008. And his strategy was to work hard in all 50 states, and particularly to organize in rural counties. Some of the County party chairs that I interviewed still remember how well organized they were at that time. And then Barack Obama comes along, and uses similar kinds of organizing strategies, and it really makes a difference. So 2006 Democrats take back Congress. And then in 2008, Barack Obama wins. And he does very well in rural places. And so with that kind of organizing, you can turn things around. But if you're just going to rely on messaging, it's not going to happen. So then how do you tell the story of what happens after 2008? And I'll say I am I respect Howard Dean's 50 state strategy, and I don't think the Democratic Party did great organizing in the coming years. But there is a collapse in Democratic support after Barack Obama becomes president that I don't think is explicable by organizing. It is a genuine collapse. 2010 is a Wipeout for Democrats in much of rural America. And I think a lot of Democrats I know they say that it's that Barack Obama was Black, That is their basic view of what happened. I don't think it's your view of what happened, but what is your view of what happened. Let me speak about both things about. Was it because Barack Obama was Black. And then also what happened. So a lot of people think the rural urban divide is reducible to racism. We find that when it started in the 1990s, that was not the case. There was plenty of racism in the country among non-Hispanic whites, but it was as prevalent among urban Americans as among rural Americans. Then you get to the period 2008 to 2020, and at that point, we find that there is a slightly greater concentration of racist attitudes among rural Americans than urban. One factor among several that is driving the divide at that point. The way we understand it is part of the resentment of the Democratic Party because rural people feel that they're not understanding our communities. These Democratic leaders, but they're really working hard on behalf of urban communities, people of color and immigrants, but they don't really understand us. And So it's a factor. But it's not a sole cause. But what is really important is that then after you had all that organizing energy that gets mobilized in the period from 2005 to 2008, Barack Obama gets elected. And there's a lot of rural people who are who've worked hard in the campaign, and they're really excited and they want to do more. And then what happens is that basically the ball is dropped by the Democratic Party and it becomes just a mailing list of the DNC, and it all goes into the ether. And then Meanwhile, the Tea Party mobilizes among the Republicans and they claim the day. But it didn't have to be this way. It was not inevitable. There's a quite big but also somewhat subtle distinction between anti-black attitudes causing the anger and the sense that the Democratic Party is prioritizing other groups over you, causing anger. White rural America's sense. The Democratic Party sees all these other groups as in need help and respect, and C and is prioritizing them ahead of them. Arlie Hochschild's idea about other groups are getting to cut in line. And then there's a real rise of discourse around white privilege. And this creates I mean, we've seen this in our politics. A lot of anger, right. You're telling me, in a poor community that has very few jobs now where life expectancy is going down, that I have white privilege. And your urban Coalition is what needs the help or illegal immigrants need the help. I'd like you to talk a bit about that distinction between the divide being discriminatory and the divide being a feeling that coalition doesn't prioritize me. So I'm going to go with a coalition that does. Yeah I think it's a really important issue in that I think a lot of urban Democrats assume that what's at play in this rural urban divide is that rural white people are racist. And what we find is that it's not reducible to that. But the way we understand it is, it's in the same period that, as we're saying, there's the sense of elite overreach on the part of Democrats and where rural Americans are looking at the Democratic Party and thinking they don't understand us, they don't care about our communities. And on this, they're seeing that the Democratic Party, they're viewing the Democratic Party as really prioritizing the needs of people of color in urban communities and immigrants, but not really understanding or caring about rural people who are struggling as well. So into this moment of divide steps of all people, Donald Trump, who is, I would say, more associated with New York City than any human being alive, is almost himself an emblem of New York City. How does he become this vehicle for the channeling of rural rage. Well, I think about this Republican County chair that we interviewed in Southern Ohio. The area had had voted for Bill Clinton twice and for Democrats, for Congress. But then the economy really goes downhill. The loss of all these jobs, closing of all these plants. And what he said was people got tired of government. And then he said, along comes Donald Trump. And yet he's rich and he's done all these things, but he got people really excited here, he said. And he said, why are you kowtowing down to these elites. They're not like you referring to. This is Trump referring to Democrats. And of course, it's ironic because, as you're saying, Trump himself is an elite and he's urban, et cetera. But people felt that there was an affinity that Trump was hearing them, that they had been left behind, that they hadn't been listened to. And so he was channeling that grievance and resentment. Trump hates all the right people. That's a way of putting it. But that's a powerful force in politics. I mean, we were talking earlier about elites, and one of the things I was saying was that both parties have elites, and I mean, Hillary Clinton, who runs against Donald Trump in 2016. Her political background is in Arkansas. She's first lady of Arkansas and has a lot of experience alongside her husband and in a state with much more rural concerns than being a real estate developer in New York City and a guy who builds golf courses. But Trump in his campaign just hates like the urban elites in the cities. And that is a stronger building of affinity, it seems to me, than more traditional. Identity right. I think if Bill Clinton had run against Donald Trump in 2016, Bill Clinton, with all of his skill as a politician, weaving together concerns of rural and urban residents. I don't think there's any doubt Donald Trump would have beat him in rural America, whether he would have beat him, I don't but I think he would have beat him in rural America because Bill Clinton, by that point, no longer hated, never did, in fact, hate the right people. And I think that raises some really difficult questions for what builds or degrades affinity when you're trying to rebuild these relationships. I think Democrats want to believe they can do it all through positive sum policy. Obamacare can help rural hospitals. And the Inflation Reduction Act and the bipartisan infrastructure bill can try to do rural broadband and cite factories in rural America. And it seems to me that so long as there is not a preexisting sense of affinity, it's all going to fall flat politically. Well, Donald Trump has been masterful at reinforcing and widening the divide that was already growing right and creating this us versus them politics and demonizing people on the other side. And so that makes it harder and harder to build affinity. And yet it's the only hope now, most of my scholarship until a few years ago was all about public policy and what policy can do. But I think we're at a point now where these divides are so great that policy can't do it all by itself. Of course, rural places really need policies in all sorts of ways to help with the economy and with health care and education, et cetera. But it's really crucial to find ways to bridge the divide. And that's where deep long term organizing is so important. Is there a way right now with Trump, in which you are seeing the rise of the most dangerous possible version of this divide, which is to say, not a divide on policy, not different votes, but a move towards violence. I've heard a lot of people who study civil wars say it is a bad sign when the federal government is ordering armed troops from some states into other states over the objections of those states governors. And these are all cities that are ordering them into those cities, mayors. And you can look at this and I think I have been looking at this and say, this sure looks like a rural coalition militarily occupying the cities whom it has come to see as the power centers of their enemies. Well, it's unthinkable. It's so un-American to be telling the military you can use cities as training grounds and to be sending in federal troops and federalized National Guard into cities. And this comes on top of Trump for the past few years using a lot of rhetoric against cities, but now using actual violent force against cities. So how is this possible. It's possible because of the rural urban divide. It's possible because this US versus them. Politics has become so deep. Do you feel as a political scientist. I mean, your last book was about threats to democracy and authoritarianism. I mean, do you think we are coming a lot closer to something that could spiral into Civil War or something like it. Well, that's a really horrifying, harrowing thought, obviously. But my colleagues who are scholars of comparative politics, who study Democratic deterioration around the world have been very worried because they see the things happening here that have happened elsewhere and led to such demise. My focus as someone who is always hopeful about the future is, how do we avoid that. And it's going to take a lot of deep rebuilding and organizing. Let's talk about how we avoid that or begin to reverse some of the urban rural split. Let's take as a premise what you say is right, that it would be good if the Democratic Party invested much more in organizing and contesting in rural areas. I was surprised, as I read the end of the book, that you did not have more to say about who the Democratic Party runs, particularly nationally, and what they run on. I would assume you could tell me if you think this is wrong. It is going to be easier for an organizer in much of rural America if it's Andy Beshear on top of the ticket, than if it's Gavin Newsom or Kamala Harris that it was in some ways easier when it was, when the Democratic Party was led by Harry Reid and Tom Daschle in the Senate. And now both of the Congressional leaders are from New York. The political scientist Steve Talley likes to talk about costly signals. The sending of costly signals, things where you're doing something that show you're a different kind of Democrat or Republican than others are. Donald Trump sends lots of costly signals. He attacks urban America and urban elites in personal, vicious, vitriolic terms. He talks about sending the National Guard into their cities. He's talked about that for a long time, and he takes the conflict because it communicates to the people he wants to communicate to that he's on their side. Yeah if the Democratic Party really wanted to do this right, if it said, this is a we have to figure something out here. And that requires doing things that are different than what we have been doing. What can it do. So at the moment, Trump has done very well getting elected in rural places by bigger and bigger margins. Fueled by grievance. But grievance ultimately does not put food on the table. It doesn't bring you health care, affordable health care in your community. And it doesn't help you to your kids to get a good education. Democrats need to be in rural places to say these issues are the priorities of our party, to help with the economy, health care, education, et cetera and to be there to make those connections for people if they're not there, if they're not campaigning there, if statewide Democrats are not going to rural places to campaign, if the party is not putting full time organizers in rural places, then people feel abandoned there and they feel this party doesn't care about us. I guess one place where I was skeptical goal of yearbooks insistence that policy wasn't a big contributor here was that most of the modern politicians who you talked about who had been successful in rural America, were known not just for their moderation but for the Democratic politicians. I mean, not just for moderation but for often running against the Democratic Party. Joe Manchin, who in his first Senate campaign shoots the cap and trade bill Democrats are considering with a gun to show what a different kind of Democrat he is. Ben Nelson in Nebraska, who is such a thorn in the side of the Democrats during Obamacare. The same with Congressman Stupak. Bob kerrey, who was often very annoying to the Democratic Party when he was a representative from Nebraska, John Bel Edwards, who was the governor of Louisiana until pretty recently a Democrat, very, very, very pro-life. And, I mean, it looked to me and it looks to me like the Democrats who have done well in rural areas, actually do differ from other Democrats on policy. Jared Golden is a supporter of tariffs. Ray Gluesenkamp Perez is a very different kind of politics and policy than her colleagues. I don't know if what is happening here is that shifting on policy is a way of communicating. You're not like the other Democrats, or if it is actually the policy itself that matters. But it felt like attention to me in your book that on the one hand, the Democratic politicians who've succeeded in rural America and still succeed look on policy very different than the Democrats in urban America. And on the other hand, there was a real push that they don't need to do anything on policy. They just need more organizers. I would say, looking at the members of Congress for whom, we took kind of a deep dive and the Affordable Care Act to look at all these rural members, many of whom were swing votes on the Affordable Care Act. But most of them ultimately voted for it. And some chose some of the rural Democrats ultimately voted against it. But some of them were very progressive on economic issues. And they were trying very hard to be faithful to their communities in that some of them, as you say, were pro-life and not pro-choice. And so they had concerns until there was a deal cut on how the Aca would handle abortion. But I would say, while incorporating rural districts and states may mean more moderates, it doesn't necessarily mean that because some rural places, a politician will represent them in a way that's more progressive. And that's being true to their constituents. Have we seen any of that in modern times. I mean, I would like that to be true. It would be, from my perspective, better if you could just go full economic populist and moderate on nothing else and win. And my leftist friends tell me That's true and I just don't see the representatives. I mean, even somebody like Dan Osborn in Nebraska, who runs not as a Democrat because the Democratic Party is just too toxic to run on in Nebraska. He is economically populist. And he also says, I will build the wall on the border with my own hands. He swings very far right from where Democrats are at that moment on immigration. I just don't see the examples of these Democrats winning back or even non-democrats independents somehow winning back rural areas without running against some parts of the Democratic party's platform from the right. And I'm not saying this because I would like to see more Democrats move to the right, but I think that seems to be what has worked. I think it's less moderating on issues than what issues you prioritize. I think that what the political party, County chairs that we spoke to told us is that the issues that are most important to people are the economy, health care, education, et cetera they were not mentioning gun rights and abortion and immigration as top issues. So it's a matter of the level of priority that you give those, but also different kinds of. Stances in different places could work. So I guess that raises the question of what happened to all those Democratic representatives who did run in exactly that way. I have watched some of the Democratic politicians doing that just not be able to survive. Sherrod Brown is a very effective economic populist, and despite how much he has emphasized that set of issues for his entire career, he has gone from being extremely competitive in Ohio's rural districts to completely destroy in them. When he was running against a car dealer who had had to settle a bunch of wage theft lawsuits. But the same is true for Jon Tester in Montana. Tester was, again, a very, very capable bread and butter pocketbook issues politician that something has happened where the politicians who are doing the strategy to a T cannot survive, not even in the most conservative states. Montana and Ohio are far from the reddest states we have in the union now. And it just seems to me that we are seeing that the drag of the National Democratic Party is making the just talk about the popular stuff strategy no longer viable, when maybe 10 years ago or 12 years ago, it was still viable. Yeah, I think, what I've been describing is this historical process over several decades of how the rural urban divide emerged. And it's now very deep, and it's the causes for it are multilayered and entrenched. So you can't just overcome it with a particular race. There has to be this deep, long term effort to rebuild bridges to rural America by the Democratic Party being there. And you know that when we spoke with Democratic County chairs in all of these different states, they would say to us that they didn't feel supported by their state level party, and they didn't think the DNC even knew about them. These are local organizations where in the past there were lots of people who had come out for meetings. Now it's a handful of people and they're senior citizens and they need support. But they did feel that when Howard Dean was the head of the DNC, they were getting that kind of support. And they were able to make a real difference. So that's what's essential. It's also the case that while it can seem really daunting in a statewide election, giving some support to rural areas can make a big difference. If you use the strategy of losing by less, which is something they all talk about. There were County chairs like when we went around Georgia and they'd had these very tight races statewide, the Senate, Senate races where senators Ossoff and Warnock got elected and the Democratic County chairs would say, if I can get my margin here to not be just 34 percent but get it up to 37 percent for the Democratic candidate. And if everybody does that in rural areas, we're going to win statewide. And they did it. And they felt very proud of it. And they felt they made a big difference in getting those candidates over the finish line in those very tight races. And that's exactly the kind of thing that can make a huge difference in statewide races. For president and for governorships and for senators all across the country. Our final question what are three books you'd recommend to the audience. Oh, yeah, I love this question. So I want to recommend first, another book about rural America by a political scientist. And that's Catherine Kramer's book The Politics of resentment rural consciousness in Wisconsin and the rise of Scott Walker. This book came out several years ago in 2016. It's based on years of her going to all sorts of conversation groups around rural Wisconsin, and really listening to people and understanding how they were thinking about politics in the state. And so it's deeply insightful. And we really built upon her work. But then for my other choices, I decided we shouldn't just be reading nonfiction in this time. I feel strongly about that. So my second choice is going to be a novel, and that is Barbara Kingsolver's book, Demon Copperhead. And Barbara Kingsolver grew up in rural Kentucky, and she writes this book that's really based in Appalachia. And I think just really helps people to understand much more the nuance and complexity of what's going on in one place in rural America. And then finally, I found that this year, well, when I was a young person, I loved poetry a lot. And this year I decided I need more poetry back in my life. So I have been reading Mary Oliver's book devotions, which is a collection of a lot of her best work. She grew up in rural Ohio, and then she lived a lot of her life on Cape Cod. And it's about the beauty of natural places. And I think it's also a great tribute to rural America. Suzanne Mettler, Thank you very much. Great to be with you. Thank you.",

        "description": "Republican New Jersey gubernatorial candidate Jack Ciattarelli discusses the tight race against Mikie Sherrill, his response to her claims on opioid deaths and more on 'Fox News Sunday.'\n\nWith two weeks until Election Day, and the latest polls pointing to a potential photo finish in the battle for New Jersey governor, the two major party nominees are urging their supporters to get out and vote.\n\n\"When we vote, we win,\" Democratic nominee Rep. Mikie Sherrill said this past weekend at a rally.\n\nAnd her Republican rival, Jack Ciattarelli, told his supporters that \"championship teams finish strong... let's win this race.\"\n\nNew Jersey is just one of two states, along with Virginia, that hold statewide elections for governor this November. And the contests, which traditionally grab outsized national attention, are viewed as crucial early tests of President Donald Trump's unprecedented and relentless second-term agenda, as well as key barometers ahead of next year's midterm showdowns for the U.S. House and Senate.\n\nHEAD HERE FOR THE LATEST FOX NEWS REPORTING ON THE 2025 ELECTIONS\n\nAlso in the political spotlight this November is New York City's high-profile mayoral election, the ballot box proposition over congressional redistricting in California, and three state Supreme Court contests in battleground Pennsylvania.\n\nDemocrats, who are aiming to exit the political wilderness following last year's election setbacks when they lost control of the White House and Senate and failed to win back the House majority, are highlighting their success so far this year in special elections.\n\n\"There's wind at our back,\" Democratic National Committee (DNC) Chair Ken Martin recently touted. \"We have overperformed in every single election that's been on the ballot since Donald Trump was inaugurated.\"\n\nONE OF THE TOP 2025 RACES MAY END UP IN A PHOTO FINISH\n\nBut Republicans point to the multitude of problems facing the Democratic Party.\n\n\"Sadly for the DNC, the truth is that Democrats' approval rating is at a 30-year low as the party has hemorrhaged more than 2 million voters over the past four years,\" Republican National Committee communications director Zach Parkinson told Fox News Digital recently.\n\nHere's a closer look at 2025's top elections.\n\nCiattarelli, who's making his third straight run for Garden State governor and who nearly upset Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy four years ago, has good reason to be optimistic he can pull off victory in blue-leaning New Jersey.\n\nIn a state where registered Democrats still outnumber Republicans despite a GOP surge in registration this decade, three public opinion polls released last week -- from Fox News, Quinnipiac University and Fairleigh Dickinson University -- indicated Ciattarelli narrowing the gap with Democratic gubernatorial nominee Rep. Mikie Sherrill in the race to succeed the term-limited Murphy.\n\nThe Fox News poll, conducted Oct. 10 - 14, put Sherrill at 50% support among likely voters, with Ciattarelli at 45%. Sherrill's 5-point advantage was down from an 8-point lead in Fox News' September survey in New Jersey.\n\nWhile Democrats have long dominated federal and state legislative elections in blue-leaning New Jersey, Republicans are very competitive in gubernatorial contests, winning five out of the past 10 elections.\n\nAnd Trump made major gains in New Jersey in last year's presidential election, losing the state by only six percentage points, a major improvement over his 16-point deficit four years earlier.\n\nTHE POLITICAL BOMB TRUMP EXPLODED IN THE NEW JERSEY SHOWDOWN FOR GOVERNOR\n\nMultiple sources confirmed to Fox News that Trump will hold a tele-rally with Ciattarelli ahead of Election Day. Trump's teaming up with Ciattarelli may help energize MAGA supporters, many of whom are low propensity voters who often skip casting ballots in non-presidential election years.\n\nThe race in New Jersey was rocked a couple of weeks ago by a report that the National Personnel Records Center, which is a branch of the National Archives and Records Administration, mistakenly released Sherrill's improperly redacted military personnel files, which included private information like her Social Security number, to a Ciattarelli ally.\n\nBut Sherrill's military records indicated that the United States Naval Academy blocked her from taking part in her 1994 graduation amid a cheating scandal.\n\nSherrill, who was never accused of cheating in the scandal, went on to serve nearly a decade in the Navy, flying helicopters.\n\nThe showdown was jolted again two weeks ago after Sherrill's allegations that Ciattarelli was \"complicit\" with pharmaceutical companies in the opioid deaths of tens of thousands of New Jerseyans, as she pointed to the medical publishing company he owned that pushed content promoting the use of opioids as a low-risk treatment for chronic pain.\n\nCLICK HERE TO CHECK OUT THE LATEST FOX NEWS POLLING\n\nLast week, Trump set off a political hand grenade in the race, as he \"terminated\" billions of federal dollars for the Gateway Project, which is funding a new train tunnel under the Hudson River connecting New Jersey and New York.\n\nSherrill, holding a news conference Thursday at a major commuter rail station just a few miles from the site of the tunnels in one of the busiest train corridors in the nation, called the project \"critical\" as she took aim at Trump and Ciattarelli.\n\nExplosive revelations in Virginia's attorney general race that the GOP is aiming to leverage up and down the ballot recently shook up the race for governor, forcing Democratic Party nominee, former Rep. Abigail Spanberger, back on defense in a race where most polls indicated her enjoying a sizable lead over Republican rival Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears.\n\nVirginia attorney general Democratic nominee Jay Jones has been in crisis mode since his controversial texts were first reported a couple of weeks ago by the National Review.\n\nJones acknowledged and apologized for texts he sent in 2022, when he compared then-Virginia House Speaker Todd Gilbert to mass murderers Adolf Hitler and Pol Pot, adding that if he was given two bullets, he would use both against the GOP lawmaker to shoot him in the head.\n\nBut he's facing a chorus of calls from Republicans to drop out of the race.\n\nEarle-Sears hasn't wasted an opportunity to link Spanberger to Jones.\n\nAnd during this month's chaotic and only gubernatorial debate, where Earle-Sears repeatedly interrupted Spanberger, the GOP gubernatorial nominee called on her Democratic rival to tell Jones to end his attorney general bid.\n\nFOR THE LATEST FOX NEWS REPORTING ON THE VIRGINIA SHOWDOWN, HEAD HERE\n\n\"The comments that Jay Jones made are absolutely abhorrent,\" Spanberger said at the debate. But she neither affirmed nor pulled back her support of Jones.\n\nEarle-Sears has kept up the pressure.\n\n\"Abigail Spanberger should have been the first to call for Jay Jones to step down. Instead, she doubled down -- because deep down, she's OK with what he said,\" Earle-Sears argued recently in a social media post.\n\nThe mayoral election in the nation's most populous city always grabs outsized attention, especially this year as New York City may elect its first Muslim and first millennial mayor.\n\nDemocratic socialist 33-year-old state lawmaker Zohran Mamdani's victory in June's Democratic Party mayoral primary sent political shock waves across the country. And he's come under attack from Republicans and from his rivals on the ballot over his far-left proposals.\n\nMamdani is the clear polling and fundraising frontrunner in the heavily blue city as he faces off against former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who came in a distant second in the primary and is now running as an independent candidate. Cuomo is aiming for a political comeback after resigning as governor four years ago amid multiple scandals.\n\nTHE LATEST FOX NEWS REPORTING ON THE NEW YORK CITY MAYORAL ELECTION IS RIGHT HERE\n\nAlso running is two-time Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa, a co-founder of the Guardian Angels, the non-profit, a volunteer-based community safety group.\n\nEmbattled Mayor Eric Adams, a Democrat who was running for re-election as an independent, dropped out of the race last month, but his name remains on the ballot.\n\nVoters in heavily blue California will vote in November on whether to set aside their popular nonpartisan redistricting commission for the rest of the decade and allow the Democrat-dominated legislature to determine congressional redistricting for the next three election cycles.\n\nThe vote will be the culmination of an effort by Gov. Gavin Newsom and California Democrats to create up to five left-leaning congressional seats in the Golden State to counter the new maps that conservative Gov. Greg Abbott signed into law last week, which will create up to five more right-leaning U.S. House districts in the red state of Texas.\n\nThe redistricting in Texas, which came after Trump's urging, is part of a broader effort by the GOP across the country to pad their razor-thin House majority to keep control of the chamber in the 2026 midterms, when the party in power traditionally faces political headwinds and loses seats.\n\nPolls suggest majority support for passage of what's known as Proposition 50.\n\nDemocrats currently hold a 5-2 majority on the Supreme Court in the northeastern battleground of Pennsylvania.\n\nBut three Democrat-leaning justices on the state Supreme Court, following the completion of their 10-year terms, are running this year to keep their seats in \"Yes\" or \"No\" retention elections.\n\nThe election could upend the court's composition for the next decade, heavily influence whether Democrats or Republicans have an advantage in the state's congressional delegation and legislature, and impact crucial cases including voting rights and reproductive rights.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nWhile state Supreme Court elections typically don't grab much national attention, contests where the balance of a court in a key battleground state is up for grabs have attracted tons of outside money.\n\nThe state Supreme Court showdown this spring in Wisconsin, where the 4-3 liberal majority was maintained, drew nearly $100 million in outside money as both parties poured resources into the election.",

        "description": "Ongoing construction on the East Wing of the White House, where U.S. President Donald Trump's proposed ballroom is being built, in Washington, D.C., October 20, 2025. REUTERS/Jessica Koscielniak\n\nThe White House reacted late Monday to deafening criticism of its shock move to pull down part of the White House's historic East Wing to make way for a massive ballroom.\n\nPresident Trump defended the massive project, declaring, \"They've wanted a ballroom for 150 years. And I'm giving that honor to this wonderful place. You're gonna see a ballroom the likes of which... I don't think it'll be topped.\"\n\nDemolition crews moved in on Monday, ripping off the face of the White House wing to begin building the 90,000-square-foot ballroom, designed to accommodate 999 people and be covered in bulletproof glass. California Governor Gavin Newsom dramatically stating Trump is \"Ripping apart the White House just like he's ripping apart the Constitution.\"\n\nBut White House officials aggressively defended the renovation. Communications Director Steven Cheung argued, \"Construction has always been a part of the evolution of the White House. Losers who are quick to criticize need to stop their pearl clutching and understand the building needs to be modernized.\"\n\nHe also hit out at a Democratic critic, calling him \"moronic\" and a \"buffoon.\"\n\nTrump emphasized that the project is being privately funded by rich donors -- including himself. He recently held an exclusive dinner to thank donors who contributed millions. \"A couple of you sitting here [were] saying, 'Uh, sir, would $25 million be appropriate?',\" Trump noted. \"I said, 'I'll take it.'\"\n\nThe White House's official response repeatedly stressed that taxpayers would not bear the cost, with its official X account claiming the ballroom \"will be cherished for generations.\"\n\nCritics, including Senators Elizabeth Warren and Tina Smith, lambasted the project. CNN commentator Karen Finney called the timing \"fairly grotesque,\" especially during a government shutdown and high inflation.\n\nIn contrast, CNN's conservative commentator Scott Jennings praised the renovation, saying, \"Donald Trump is all about hospitality... This is going to give us a place in the White House to do the biggest and best hospitality we've ever done.\"",

        "title": "Los Angeles copper wire theft is leaving communities in the dark. How is it getting fixed?",
        "description": "As surging copper wire thefts are leaving many Los Angeles communities in the dark, a new statewide metal theft law set to kick in next year is aimed at recyclers who buy the stolen metal.\n\nLos Angeles city leaders, law enforcement and business leaders called on Governor Gavin Newsom to sign Assembly Bill 476 \"Metal Theft,\" as copper wire theft has cost communities not only money, but safety.\n\nThe Sixth Street Bridge in downtown Los Angeles, originally called the \"Ribbon of Light,\" is a glaring example, as it sits in darkness with seven miles of copper wire stolen and stripped from the 2023-built bridge.\n\nWhile the stolen copper is valued at $11,000, repairs to rewire it for lighting are estimated to cost over $2.5 million - and have yet to be completed.\n\nSimilar wire theft crime scenes play out throughout the county, including around the Cahuenga Pass. Joy Taylor says her streetlights have been out for eight months, since February.\n\n\"I not only worry about cars not seeing us, but we have a lot of wildlife in this neighborhood, and there's coyotes that are coming through the area,\" Taylor said.\n\nIn Encino, five streetlights are out of commission on a single block, leaving one couple to alter their evening walks with their aging father because of it.\n\n\"Unfortunately, because of the cracks in the sidewalk, my dad's 83 years old, he can't see, and you know, myself as well, I will trip on the cracks. You just can't walk at night, you can't when it's pitch black,\" Elayne said.\n\nCBS News California Investigates obtained and analyzed city data and found that there have been more than 37,000 streetlight repair requests made so far in 2025. As of September, more than half are still waiting for service.\n\nThe Bureau of Street Lighting said through an email statement that 15% of the system is affected by outages.\n\nLA County District Attorney Nathan Hochman said that broken streetlights have life and death consequences. He noted the downtown Los Angeles shooting death of actor Johnny Wactor.\n\n\"He got killed because three individuals were trying to steal his catalytic converter. But why did they choose Johnny Wactor's car at 3 a.m. at that exact spot? Because the streetlights were out --it was dark,\" Hochman said.\n\nThe Bureau says nearly half of its service requests are due to wire theft, and the other half are routine maintenance. This leads to a nine to 12-month period before repairs can be made, as there are less than 200 field staff to cover the city's quarter of a million streetlights.\n\nLos Angeles Councilmember Nithya Raman represents the district that includes the Cahuenga Pass and she said she is constantly getting calls about broken streetlights. \"To me, it's unacceptable that it takes up to a year to fix a broken streetlight,\" Raman said.\n\nShe's calling for an update to property assessment rates, to fund streetlight maintenance as the fees haven't been adjusted since the 90s.\n\nNeighbors in the Cahuenga Pass have taken matters into their own hands by pooling money to install their own streetlights. Residents Martha Carr and Joy Taylor said they aren't waiting for the city to come to the rescue, and instead are subsidizing a city service with two motion-activated lights.\n\n\"Well, in a strange way, I felt empowered that I was able to do something myself, but I shouldn't have to,\" Carr said.\n\nMayor Karen Bass' Office responded by email, saying the city is \"embracing new and innovative technologies like solar lighting,\" moving away from copper wire. \"Mayor Bass has begun that work as hundreds of solar streetlights have been installed,\" the Mayor's Office wrote.\n\nAssembly member Mark Gonz\u00e1lez authored AB 476, stating that \"Copper wire theft is not a victim-less crime.\"\n\nThe bill puts more responsibility on junk dealers when purchasing scrap metal, leaving thieves with fewer options when selling. Buyers will be required to verify the seller's identity and lawful ownership. Certain scrap metal from streetlights and traffic signals will be illegal to possess, and the bill also increases penalties for recyclers who purchase materials that belong to public entities without ensuring the seller has proper authorization to do so.\n\n\"Every stolen wire is more than metal ripped from the ground; it's light ripped from our communities,\" Gonz\u00e1lez said.\n\nThe city is also working on a Metal and Wire Theft Reward Program, where rewards of $5,000 would be offered for information leading to felony grand theft charges and $1,000 for misdemeanor charges involving city-owned metal thefts, including copper wiring, plaques, streetlight parts and more.",

He graduated with a BA in Journalism from CSUS.\n\nDrivers in Citrus Heights may have noticed a message directed at Gov. Gavin Newsom and Proposition 50 displayed on an electronic traffic sign in recent days.\n\nThe sign, which read \"F--- Newscum No on 50,\" appeared near Fair Oaks Boulevard and Old Auburn Road and was visible for at least two nights.\n\nIn a statement, the City of Citrus Heights said the message board, which was not owned or controlled by the city, had been tampered with by an unknown party.\n\n\"The message board is owned and operated by a third-party traffic safety contractor, Sierra Safety, and was accessed by an unknown party without authorization,\" the city said in a statement. \"The City does not own or manage the board's programming. We are confident our contracting partners will implement appropriate safeguards to prevent future incidents.\"\n\nCity officials said the issue was resolved the same day they were notified.\n\nA representative for Sierra Safety told CBS Sacramento the company only sells or rents traffic message boards and does not manage or program them.\n\nCalifornia voters will decide on Proposition 50 in a November 4 special election. The measure, if passed, would shift five of California's U.S. House seats to be more favorable to Democrats in the 2026 midterm elections.

        "description": "Gov. Gavin Newsom nursed a bottle of tequila in his mansion while Los Angeles burned in Palisades Fire -- and pouted that President Trump was blaming him for the devastating blaze.\n\n\"I felt the weight of everything collapsing,\" Newsom recently told Bloomberg Businessweek. \"We're just lost the election. I was watching Elon at peak Elon, Trump at peak Trump.\"\n\nNewsom had just returned home from a week visiting the still-burning ruins of Los Angeles -- where fire hydrants had no water and citizens on the street accosted him with accusations, all as Trump himself raged on social media \"NO MORE EXUSES.\"\n\n\"He was getting absolutely massacred by everybody,\" said Newsom's good friend Doug Hendrickson, who joined the California governor for the pickled pity party in January.\n\n\"Like it was his fault, the whole thing. He was sort of a train wreck,\" Hendrickson added.\n\nIt remains unclear if the pair pounded booze at the California governor's mansion in Sacramento, or at Newsom's $9 million mansion outside San Francisco in Marin County.\n\nNewsom was very much in the line of fire at the time, with Trump -- then President Elect -- pouring on criticism for the city and state's inability to put out the Palisades Fire, which would destroy 7,000 homes and businesses and kill 12 people before it was contained after about a month.\n\n\"The fires are still raging in LA. The incompetent pols have no idea how to put them out,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social on January 12. \"They just can't put out the fires. What's wrong with them?\"\n\nIn another post days earlier, Trump blamed Newsom for prioritizing an endangered fish over the people of LA and accused him of draining local reservoirs.\n\n\"He is the blame for this,\" Trump wrote.\n\nAnd Newsom claimed to Bloomberg that he was terrified of what was coming once Trump was sworn in on Jan. 20 -- recalling how he'd been able to work with the president to fight another LA fire in 2018/\n\nBut he said then-president-elect Trump seemed determined only to attack him.\n\n\"I'm like, this is a different guy,\" Newsom told Bloomberg.\n\nHowever, the fires were one of the experiences that inspired Newsom to become one of Trump's most vocal opponents in a Democratic party that's floundered to make sense of itself since President Biden's re-election campaign imploded, and Vice President Harris was quickly proved incapable of carrying the party's standard into a new era.\n\nNewsom seems to believe he's the man to take on Republicans in 2028, and has ramped up attacks on Trump in recent months -- notably trying to keep up with the president's sophomoric tactics by blasting off outrageous all-caps tweets of his own on the governor's official X account.\n\nBut Newsom, who was born to a wealthy and politically connected family, would have to contend with an image that both he and the tech-wealthy state of California have gained for West Coast elitism if he chooses to run -- and its an image he thinks is unfair.\n\n\"I think there's a California derangement syndrome,\" he told Bloomberg. \"It's extraordinary, the bulls-t I hear about this state.\"",

The bulk of that investment has been in San Francisco and Silicon Valley, where 80% of AI venture funding through the third quarter has been targeted to the tune of $115 billion.\n\nBy the end of the September, the San Francisco Bay Area was already 35% above its previous annual investment peak, according to CBRE's VC Funding analysis.\n\n\"San Franciscans are feeling positive about the direction of our city once again,\" Daniel Lurie, the city's Democratic mayor said in a statement last week released by Governor Gavin Newsom's office. \"And we are going to continue working every single day to build on this progress and keep our city safe 365 days a year.\"\n\nThe statement was meant to tout the successful efforts of local law enforcement ahead of Salesforce's annual Dreamforce conference last week. The issue became particularly controversial after Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff told the New York Times that he'd support Trump's call for federal troops to be sent to San Francisco. His sentiments were publicly supported by Elon Musk and David Sacks, high-profile techies with close ties to the Trump Administration.\n\nOn Friday, facing mounting criticism, Benioff backtracked, posting on X that, \"Having listened closely to my fellow San Franciscans and our local officials, and after the largest and safest Dreamforce in our history, I do not believe the National Guard is needed to address safety in San Francisco.\"",

        "title": "Trump's impending San Francisco crackdown sparks backlash from Newsom, mayor",
        "description": "Fox News' Jacqui Heinrich reports the latest on the Trump administration's crime crackdown from the White House.\n\nThe White House is urging California Democrats to welcome the National Guard to \"clean up\" San Francisco, but Gov. Gavin Newsom, D-Calif., said the deployment will \"ruin one of America's greatest cities. \"\n\nPresident Donald Trump told Fox News' Maria Bartiromo that the National Guard is headed to San Francisco next. In a statement shared exclusively with Fox News Digital on Monday, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said San Francisco Democrats should \"welcome the President in to clean up their city.\"\n\n\"America's once great cities have descended into chaos and crime as a result of Democrat policies that put criminals first and law-abiding citizens last,\" Jackson said Monday. \"Making America Safe Again -- especially crime-ridden cities -- was a key campaign promise from the President that the American people elected him to fulfill.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Mayor Daniel Lurie was also elected last November with a commitment to restoring public safety to San Francisco.\n\nNEWSOM SUES TRUMP ADMINISTRATION OVER CALIFORNIA NATIONAL GUARD DEPLOYMENT ORDER TO OREGON\n\n\"Since January, I have said that public safety is my number one priority,\" Lurie said during a public safety briefing Friday. \"Over the last nine months, we have backed that up, rebuilding the ranks of our public safety agencies, strengthening coordination across departments and strategically deploying technology. It's working, and this week proved it.\"\n\nDEM GOVERNORS SUDDENLY CRACK DOWN ON CRIME AS TRUMP'S NATIONAL GUARD THREATS LOOM\n\nBut the White House urged California Democrats to recognize the progress made in Memphis, Tennessee, and in Washington, D.C., where fellow Democratic Mayor Muriel Bowser has acknowledged the Trump administration's success cleaning up the nation's capital.\n\n\"We're going to go to San Francisco,\" Trump said on Sunday. \"The difference is, I think they want us in San Francisco. San Francisco was truly one of the great cities of the world, and then 15 years ago, it went wrong. It went woke.\"\n\nNewsom was quick to fire back in a social media post Sunday, writing, \"Fact check: Nobody wants you here. You will ruin one of America's greatest cities.\"\n\nDuring the safety briefing Friday, Lurie noted that, last week, more than 45,000 people descended upon San Francisco for Salesforce's \"Dreamforce 2025\" conference, featuring hundreds of events about advancing technology and artificial intelligence.\n\n\"45,000 visitors, and no reports of any major incidents. Once again, the eyes of the world were on San Francisco, and we delivered,\" Lurie said, while applauding first responders and city workers who make San Francisco \"shine.\"\n\n\"It happened because of our close partnership with the California Highway Patrol,\" Lurie said. \"We are working with the appropriate state and federal enforcement agencies every day to keep our city safe, and that coordination is delivering results for San Francisco.\"\n\nNewsom criticized Trump in August for \"militarizing American cities\" after the president deployed National Guard troops to Washington, D.C., to fight crime in the nation's capital. Trump has since deployed troops to Chicago, Memphis and Portland.\n\nThe California governor, a frequent Trump critic who is considered a likely 2028 presidential candidate, deployed California Highway Patrol \"crime-suppression teams\" across the Golden State in August to prevent crime and promote public safety.\n\n\"While the Trump administration undermines cities, California is partnering with them and delivering real results. With these new deployments, we're doubling down on these partnerships to build on progress and keep driving crime down,\" Newsom said in a statement in August, seemingly to deter another National Guard deployment to California.\n\nTrump deployed the National Guard to Los Angeles this spring during protests rejecting deportations by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, in line with another Trump mandate.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIn an Instagram post following the \"No Kings\" protests on Saturday, which erupted across the country in rejection of Trump's sweeping, second-term agenda, Lurie thanked San Francisco law enforcement and protesters for maintaining peace.\n\nWhen reached for comment, Newsom's and Lurie's team pointed to their previous statements from their social media posts and the Friday press conference.",

        "description": "The California Highway Patrol said shrapnel from an artillery shell that detonated prematurely struck a squad car and a police motorcycle that were part of Vice President J.D. Vance's protective detail during his visit over the weekend to a Marine Corps base near San Diego.\n\nOn Saturday, a 155mm M-777 howitzer was fired at Camp Pendleton, about 40 miles north of San Diego, as part of a demonstration to mark the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Marine Corps.\n\nAccording to a report from the California Highway Patrol, the Marines had been scheduled to fire at least 60 rounds during the visit by Mr. Vance, a Marine Corps veteran who served in Iraq.\n\nThe artillery round was fired at 1:46 p.m. from White's Beach, about 3/4 of a mile south of Las Pulgas Road, where the California Highway Patrol vehicles parked after escorting Mr. Vance to the base.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom ordered the temporary closure of a 17-mile stretch of a highway near Camp Pendleton during the event.\n\nPassenger rail service on a line running adjacent to the freeway was also delayed.\n\nThe move prompted a brief \"Twitter War\" between Sacramento and Washington.\n\n\"Not only did nobody at the White House or the Marines ask him to do so, the Marines repeatedly said there are no public safety concerns with today's exercises,\" according to a statement on X from the White House rapid response team that referred to the governor as \"Newscum.\"\n\n\"Newscum lies and tries to make it about himself - day ending in 'Y',\" Trump administration officials said.\n\nState officials accused the Trump administration of misleading California residents about live munitions being shot over the normally busy Interstate 5.\n\n\"Then you accused the governor of overreacting when he closed a portion of the freeway to protect the public,\" Mr. Newsom's press office said. \"Now we learn that live [ordnance] detonated early, striking a vehicle on a closed portion of the highway during the event.\"\n\nThe Marine Corps is investigating the incident, which is standard practice for the U.S. military when an artillery round misfires or lands outside the planned impact area.\n\nUnlike a self-contained bullet, a howitzer round is usually comprised of multiple sections, including the powder, the primer, the shell, and a fuze. Depending on the mission, the fuze could be set to detonate on impact, when internal sensors determine the round is near the target, or at a specific moment after firing.\n\nIf a timed fuze malfunctions or is incorrectly set, it could cause an artillery round to prematurely detonate.\n\nState police said they stopped traffic along Interstate 5 shortly before the artillery barrage was scheduled to be fired. The first, and apparently the sole, round was fired at 1:46 p.m., officials said in a report obtained by The Washington Times.\n\n\"At this time, an artillery round failed to clear the roadway and detonated mid-flight near Interstate 5 southbound. After the failed round, the exercise was terminated and no additional munitions were fired,\" California Highway Patrol officials said in their report.\n\nOne of the state officers on the protective detail reported hearing what sounded like pebbles falling on his police motorcycle. Officers also found small pieces of what appeared to be shrapnel that left a small dent on the hood of a patrol car.\n\nA safety sweep of Interstate 5 southbound did not turn up any additional pieces of metal, according to the California Highway Patrol.\n\nAlthough there were no reported injuries, state law enforcement officials immediately notified the Marine Corps which canceled the remaining fire.\n\n\"This was an unusual and concerning situation. It is highly uncommon for any live-fire or explosive training activity to occur over an active freeway,\" California Highway Patrol border division chief Tony Coronado said in a statement.\n\n\"As a Marine myself, I have tremendous respect for our military partners, but my foremost responsibility is ensuring the safety of the people of California and the officers who protect them,\" he said.\n\nThe California Highway Patrol is recommending a review into the planning, communication, and coordination that took place on Saturday between federal, state, and local government agencies.",

        "title": "'No Kings' demonstrations expose the left's ignorance and hypocrisy",
        "description": "With voters rejecting their policies, Democrats turn to street theater instead of offering solutions\n\nWhat do you do when voters have rejected your party's policies and the losers have nothing new to offer?\n\nAnswer: You stage large demonstrations that include name calling (this from Democrats who have called for \"lowering\" the rhetorical temperature). Anyone who believes Saturday's \"No Kings\" (was that poll tested?) demonstrations across the country were not organized and largely paid for by left-wing groups hasn't been paying attention.\n\nThe New York Times claims there is \"no evidence\" that the event was subsidized by billionaire George Soros and other far-left people and organizations. That's because the underwriting isn't given directly but is filtered, like the Mafia used to launder money, through groups that wipe clean the donor's fingerprints.\n\nAt the New York City event, chants were heard comparing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers to the Ku Klux Klan. No, the Klan violated the civil rights of Black Americans, lynched some and made a mockery of the law. ICE is upholding laws enacted by Democratic and Republican congresses. It is apprehending known criminals and deporting undocumented aliens, those with prior convictions and drug dealers. What other laws do these protesters think can be violated with impunity?\n\nBack in the day when I was a reporter, I witnessed demonstrations for civil rights and against the Vietnam War. This was before social media and instant communications. These gatherings appeared spontaneous and heartfelt, though some conservatives claimed the anti-war demonstrations were supported by communists.\n\nSaturday's nationwide demonstrations appear to me to have been choreographed. As with other left-wing-inspired demonstrations on college campuses and elsewhere, I'm not buying the claim these were spontaneous uprisings that can be compared to the Boston Tea Party. That was the analogy used by Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Massachusetts Democrat. On the rare occasions when a reporter actually interviews a protester, it is clear the person is simply repeating what they have been told to say, heard from liberal professors or read on social media.\n\nThe left's hatred of President Trump has gone to the DEFCON 2 level. These protesters won't debate policies. Instead, they are full of anger. Yet anger is not policy. Anger and hate are irrational fulminations.\n\nOne can criticize Mr. Trump for many things, but his policies are mostly working. These include a closed border, a peace deal for the Gaza Strip (however tenuous that might appear) and destroying Venezuelan boats that the administration says were carrying drugs bound for the U.S. Are the protesters OK with the hundreds of thousands of Americans dying from fentanyl? According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, provisional data indicates that in 2024 alone, 48,422 Americans died from overdoses involving synthetic opioids, primarily illicitly manufactured fentanyl.\n\nIn a delicious irony, Turning Point USA contributor Savanah Hernandez shared video from the \"No Kings\" protest in New York City. It showed many demonstrators marching with signs labeling popular Democrats such as California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez \"ANTIFA.\"\n\nIf you paid attention to the language used by some Democrats who spoke to the protesters, it was mostly a rerun of that party's grievances, including the tired claim that the Trump tax cuts benefit only \"the rich\" and that the president is a \"dictator.\"\n\nAs more young people appear to be registering Republican in the aftermath of Charlie Kirk's assassination, Democrats increasingly appear flummoxed by Mr. Trump and his supporters.\n\nThe satirical Babylon Bee wrote this about the demonstrators: \"Millions of Americans took to the streets in order to express to the world their total and absolute ignorance about the political system they live in.\"\n\nI couldn't have said it better.",

        "title": "Wes Moore's Trump derangement syndrome clouds his limited judgment",
        "description": "Maryland's governor was on Clooney's yacht while crime ravaged Baltimore\n\nAs President Trump's historic second term in the White House reaches its ninth month, Trump derangement syndrome is running at a fever pitch among unhinged Democrats at all levels of government.\n\nLook no further than Maryland's do-nothing, far-left-wing Gov. Wes Moore, who seems to be obsessed with becoming a Gavin Newsom wannabe. Whether it's reckless spending, high crime or high taxes, Mr. Moore is trying his heart out to keep up with the disastrous governor of California in the 2028 radical Democrat George Soros presidential primary.\n\nMr. Newsom's hysteria over congressional redistricting is also living rent-free in Mr. Moore's head. In a speech last month, Mr. Moore said, \"I want to be very clear and say it loud enough for the people in the back: While these other states are determining whether or not they have fair maps ... so will Maryland.\"\n\nIt's clear that Mr. Moore's position on redistricting is driven by a strong case of TDS because he is charging straight into an unforced political error. The governor is half-right: Maryland's congressional map is unfair, but it's horribly unfair to Republicans, not Democrats. As recently as 2002, Maryland's congressional representation in Congress was split down the middle with four Democrats and four Republicans. Today, because of outrageous Democratic gerrymandering, the Old Line State's delegation in the U.S. House is now composed of seven left-wing Democrats and only one Republican in the form of conservative stalwart Rep. Andy Harris.\n\nIf Mr. Moore considered the fact that Maryland has had a Republican governor 12 out of the past 24 years and analyzed how Republican presidential candidates have fared in the state over the past several elections, he would conclude that more than one Republican district in Congress is warranted. So, if Mr. Moore really wanted to be fair, he would support a new congressional map in Maryland that has two or even three Republican districts, not zero. Yet in the age of TDS, chances are the ultra-partisan governor is eyeing a map that would have farmers on Maryland's Eastern Shore being represented in Congress by a socialist Democrat from Baltimore. This isn't leadership. If Mr. Moore really wants to earn another term in Annapolis, he has a funny way of showing it.\n\nWho knows? Maybe Mr. Moore will come to his senses and start focusing on his 2026 reelection effort before continuing to lay the groundwork for a 2028 presidential run. According to new polling, \"11% said his top accomplishment was raising taxes or making poor budget decisions, and 10% said the governor had accomplished nothing at all.\" Fresh headlines such as \"Baltimore ranked third most dangerous U.S. city by crime index\" are only making matters worse for Wes Moore as he makes premature moves on the national level such as refusing Mr. Trump's offer of federal help to make Baltimore safe again.\n\nMr. Moore's constant miscues must be getting the attention of popular former Gov. Larry Hogan, who is eligible to run for another term in 2026 and is one of the few Republicans in Maryland capable of capitalizing on Mr. Moore's failures and prevailing in a statewide contest. Mr. Moore can be defeated only by a Republican challenger who is willing to draw a sharp contrast with the failed incumbent governor, not someone who plays by the old rules and appears in photo ops with the governor around the state. Republicans shouldn't allow themselves to be used by Mr. Moore in his desperate attempt to be seen as bipartisan.\n\nMr. Moore recently said that whoever his 2026 opponent turns out to be, \"I hope you come ready.\" On that note, one thing is for certain: The next Republican nominee for Maryland governor will undoubtedly \"come ready\" by highlighting Mr. Moore's abysmal record. Upon taking office, the governor squandered the largest surplus in state history and turned it into an enormous deficit in short order. This gaffe forced him to enact record tax and fee increases earlier this year that are making Maryland a completely unaffordable place to raise a family. Add the skyrocketing energy prices that Mr. Moore's radical climate policies have caused, and you see why people are moving out of Maryland.\n\nUnfortunately for Mr. Moore, it doesn't end there. Who could forget that while Mr. Trump was busy bringing back law and order to the District of Columbia, Mr. Moore was caught on George Clooney's yacht in Italy as crime continued to ravage residents of Baltimore? With regard to the ongoing government shutdown, Mr. Moore doesn't have the guts to tell Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer, a fellow Democrat, to stop the political games and reopen the government so thousands of federal workers who live in Maryland can get back on the job and support their families.\n\nThe American people know that Trump derangement syndrome and effective leadership don't mix. Mr. Moore is about to find out the hard way that being the next garden variety Trump-hating leftist isn't enough to obscure his dreadful term in the governor's mansion or set him apart from other radical 2028 presidential aspirants.",

        "title": "Kristi Noem's ICE spends fortune on chemical weapons and guided missile warheads",
        "description": "The $170 billion in new funding for immigration enforcement operations that the Republican Party included in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act earlier this year led some to warn that the Trump administration was ramping up spending at anti-immigration agencies not just to fund its attacks on migrants, but to deploy federal forces against anyone it wanted to across U.S. communities.\n\nNew reporting on Monday detailed just how much U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has spent on weaponry since President Donald Trump took office -- weapons that have been purchased as the administration has turned federal agents on US cities such as Chicago and Portland, illustrating how the president is treating increasingly armed ICE officers as his \"private military,\" as one progressive critic said.\n\nAs images spread online of immigration agents deploying pepper spray and tear gas at nonviolent protesters, Judd Legum at Popular Information recently delved into government contracting records from the Federal Procurement Data System and found that ICE has increased its spending on \"small arms, ordnance, and ordnance accessories manufacturing\" by 700% this year compared to 2024 numbers.\n\nThe agency spent $71,515,762 on small arms from January 20 -- the day Trump began his second term -- through October 18.\n\nThe number dwarfs ICE's spending during the first Trump term, during which the agency spent about $8.4 billion annually on small arms, and during President Joe Biden's administration.\n\nThe type of weaponry purchased by ICE also raised alarm Monday, with Legum reporting that while most of the agency's spending was on guns and armor, \"there have also been significant purchases of chemical weapons and 'guided missile warheads and explosive components.'\"\n\n\"If the immigration enforcement apparatus of the United States were its own national military, it would be the 13th most heavily funded in the world. This puts it higher than the national militaries of Poland, Italy, Australia, Canada, Turkey, and Spain -- and just below Israel.\"\n\nThe reporting comes as ICE and other immigration agencies continue to deploy armed, masked agents in major Democratic-leaning US cities, where officers have been filmed and photographed pointing a weapon at a protester; firing a pepper ball at a pastor, and pointing a firearm at bystanders who saw one agent arresting a man.\n\nA CBS reporter in Chicago also accused an ICE officer of firing a pepper ball at her vehicle, causing the chemical to \"engulf the inside of her truck.\"\n\nSally Duval, a Texas state House candidate in last year's election, said she was \"curious to know why ICE needs 'guided missile warheads.'\"\n\nThe report came days after the Trump administration used the US military for what Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom called \"a profoundly absurd show of force that could put Californians directly in harm's way,\" when the Marines fired 155-millimeter artillery shells over a section of the busy Interstate 5 freeway to celebrate the military branch's 250th anniversary.\n\nNewsom accused Trump of \"using our military to intimidate people [he disagrees] with\" and called the exercise \"reckless.\"\n\nMelanie D'Arrigo, executive director of the Campaign for New York Health, said Legum's reporting on Monday showed that \"ICE was always going to be Trump's private military to deploy domestically against Americans.\"\n\nLegum's analysis -- which likely understated total spending on weapons by Trump's deportation forces, as it did not include spending by other anti-immigration agencies -- followed a report on ICE's recent funding increase by In These Times.\n\nWith the $170 billion included in the OBBBA, reported the outlet, \"if the immigration enforcement apparatus of the United States were its own national military, it would be the 13th most heavily funded in the world. This puts it higher than the national militaries of Poland, Italy, Australia, Canada, Turkey, and Spain -- and just below Israel.\"\n\nThe budget, Brandon Lee of the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights told In These Times, \"shows the misplaced priorities of this administration, where they are cutting healthcare and cutting vital programs for people across the country, and putting all of this money into a domestic terrible force.\"\n\n\"And it shows the cruelty,\" said Lee, \"that the Trump administration intends to enact on all people in the United States.\"",

        "description": "The U.S. Marine Corps -- under the watchful eyes of Vice President JD Vance and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth -- staged a demonstration on Saturday in southern California.\n\nIt wasn't a No Kings demonstration, though. It was more like a Yes Kings demonstration.\n\nSome of the Marine Corps' shells that were fired by M777 howitzers across California's Interstate 5 prematurely detonated, sending shrapnel down on what could have been hundreds of motorists.\n\nWhy the hell did the Marine Corps fire artillery shells over Interstate 5 anyway?\n\nInterstate 5 is the largest and most-traveled north-south freeway in California.\n\nThe military demonstration was part of an exercise marking the Marine Corps' 250th anniversary.\n\nBeforehand, the military predicted that the exercise would be safe, but California Governor Gavin Newsom disagreed.\n\n\"Firing live rounds over a busy highway isn't just wrong -- it's dangerous,\" Newsom said last week.\n\nNewsom was so concerned about the plan that he ordered a 17-mile stretch closed of the freeway closed between Los Angeles and San Diego -- which caused significant backups on that portion of the interstate, used by approximately 80,000 people daily.\n\nBefore the mishap, Vance's office disputed Newsom's claim that the live rounds were dangerous, saying the Marine Corp's demonstration was \"an established safe practice.\"\n\n\"If Gavin Newsom wants to oppose the training exercises that ensure our Armed Forces are the deadliest and most lethal fighting force in the world, then he can go right ahead,\" Vance's communications director said in a statement. \"It would come as no surprise that he would stoop so low considering his pathetic track record of failure as governor.\"\n\nAfter the round prematurely exploded on Saturday, the whole exercise -- which was expected to include the firing of approximately 60 155-millimeter shells -- was terminated.\n\nAn active-duty Marine artillery officer and a former Marine artillery noncommissioned officer who spoke to the New York Times described the exercise as \"unusual.\"\n\nThey said the only howitzer training they had previously observed at Camp Pendleton had taken place at approved artillery ranges on the main side of base, east of the interstate, which they said were a much safer option for training.\n\nA highway patrol official based in the area also described it as \"unusual and concerning.\"\n\nTony Coronado, the highway patrol's border division chief, said in a statement that \"it is highly uncommon for any live-fire or explosive training activity to occur near an active freeway.\"\n\nSo what's going on here? Why did the Marine Corps decide to fire live artillery shells across California's major interstate freeway on Saturday?\n\nCould the decision have had anything to do with the planned No Kings demonstrations in California on Saturday -- the heart of anti-Trump country -- and the well-known fact that Trump hates California?",

        "description": "Radio host Daniel Bongino speaks during the House Judiciary Committee hearing on Policing Practices and Law Enforcement Accountability at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, DC, U.S. June 10, 2020. Michael Reynolds/Pool via REUTERS\n\nFBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino raged against California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Monday over his opposition to President Donald Trump's impending deployment of National Guard troops to San Francisco, which Trump recently confirmed would be carried out soon.\n\nSpeaking with Fox News' Maria Bartiromo Sunday, Trump confirmed his administration's plans to deploy National Guard troops to the city, pledging to make it \"great.\"\n\nNewsom fired back at the announcement, declaring that \"nobody wants you here,\" and that Trump was poised to \"ruin one of America's greatest cities,\" which Newsom once led as its mayor from 2004 to 2011.\n\nBongino, appearing on Fox & Friends Monday, was asked how his agency may respond if Newsom pushes back against the Trump administration's plans to deploy National Guard members and federal agents to the city.\n\n\"We don't answer to the governor of California, we answer to the president, the American people, the attorney general and deputy attorney general, that's the chain of command,\" Bongino said.\n\n\"Listen, I'm not going to get into a match here, I was going to say something different but I've got to control my Queens mouth on the air with Gavin Newsom. But when he says this comment, nobody wants you here? Really? That's kind of a BS remark! The people do want us there!\"\n\nDespite Bongino's suggestion that Americans strongly support Trump's use of federal troops in major cities, a Reuters poll from August found that \"just 38%\" of Americans supported the administration's federal takeover of Washington, D.C. Trump has also ordered the deployment of troops to Los Angeles and Chicago.\n\nFox & Friends host Brian Kilmeade joined Bongino in trashing Newsom, calling him an \"expert on ruining cities,\" and alleging he \"did ruin San Francisco\" and \"basically ruined the state.\"",

        "title": "Zohran Mamdani's Flood-the-Zone Media Strategy Looks Like a Winning One | Analysis",
        "description": "As Election Day approaches, the NYC mayoral frontrunner is everywhere from the New York Times to TikTok to Fox News, and urging Democrats to \"take the case to every person\"\n\nLast November, a little-known New York State Assembly member and fledgling mayoral candidate spoke on camera with Bronx and Queens residents about why they voted for Donald Trump, capturing frustrations among working class voters who shifted away from the Democratic Party. It was the first viral video from Zohran Mamdani, who rocketed out of nowhere to win the Democratic mayoral primary in June and maintains a double-digit lead heading into the general election.\n\nLast week Mamdani could be found speaking directly to President Trump, this time through the lens of Fox News. \"He may be watching right now,\" Mamdani said, speaking to the camera. After swiping at the city's current mayor, Eric Adams, and his now-Independent rival Andrew Cuomo, Mamdani, addressing the viewer-in-chief, promised to be \"a mayor who is ready to speak at any time to lower the cost of living\" and stressed \"the needs of working class Americans.\"\n\nMamdani's ability to publicly address the president then pivot back to pounding his message about affordability, all while fielding a Fox News host's questions ranging from the NYPD to Hamas, speaks to his exceptionally deft communications skills.\n\nWhile the Fox News hit provides Democrats with a model for venturing beyond traditional venues and flourishing in potentially treacherous media terrain, Mamdani's earlier video efforts demonstrate how candidates can harness YouTube and TikTok to address pocketbook concerns in clever and engaging ways. In one video, \"Halalflation,\" Mamdani talks to vendors about the cost of food and parking permits before highlighting how specific bills before the city council could save money -- all in about 90 seconds.\n\nWhat's striking is how Mamdani has stayed consistent in his economic message this past year while vastly expanding his media reach, becoming not only the main character in a local mayoral race, but an emerging player on the national stage.\n\n\"I think the thing we have to recognize about this guy is he may be evasive, he may be a socialist, President Trump thinks he's a communist, but he is a big talent,\" said Fox News' chief political analyst Brit Hume, an unlikely admirer. \"And the striking thing about him is not only is he polished and articulate, but very disarming. He's got this ready smile, and he seems so easygoing and friendly and affable. I think it's hard for the labels put on him as an extremist to stick.\"\n\nMamdani's social media savvy has been well-documented, but he's also made his case across a wide range of outlets, from cable news networks (CNN, MSNBC) to radio shows (\"The Breakfast Club,\" \"Ebro In The Morning\") to podcasts (\"I've Had It,\" \"Plain English,\" \"Pablo Torre Finds Out\") to daytime (\"The View\") to late night (\"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.\")\n\nIn recent weeks, he's sat down for in-depth profiles in the New Yorker, Vanity Fair, and the New York Times Magazine -- more than 27,000 words combined -- and, this week, appeared with David Remnick on \"The New Yorker Radio Hour\" and with Michael Barbaro on \"The Daily.\" Next week, he's scheduled to do a live podcast taping with feisty city politics site Hell Gate.\n\nWhile much of the post-2024 election discourse focused around the need for a \"liberal Joe Rogan,\" a better course of action may be to simply go on Rogan's show, as well as others popular podcasts and programs across the political and cultural spectrum.\n\nOn the debate stage Thursday night, Mamdani urged Democrats to get out of their media bubbles in response to Cuomo challenging him to denounce left-wing Twitch and YouTube star Hasan Piker for saying America \"deserved\" 9/11.\n\nMamdani, who was interviewed by Piker earlier this year, described his 9/11 comments as \" objectionable and reprehensible,\" but added that \"part of the reason why Democrats are in the situation that we are in, of being a permanent minority in this country, is that we are looking only to speak to journalists and streamers and Americans with whom we agree with every single thing that they say.\"\n\n\"We need to take the case to every person,\" Mamdani continued, \"and I'm happy to do that, which is why I was on Fox News yesterday talking about how I wish [the debate] was more like NASCAR, so we could see all the billionaires who are sponsoring you right on your suit jacket.\"\n\nThe Wednesday Fox interview, on \"The Story With Martha MacCallum,\" included some potentially uncomfortable questions for the 33-year-old democratic socialist.\n\nFor instance, MacCallum asked if Mamdani would publicly apologize for once calling the the NYPD \"racist, anti-queer & a major threat to public safety,\" which he did on air, and she asked if Hamas should lay down their weapons, to which he didn't answer directly, leading to a raft of criticism. Still, Mamdani came out largely unscathed, with even Hume, no fan of the candidate's policies, praising his performance.\n\nOther Fox News commentators have been less kind to Mamdani; \"So fake, and such a fraud\" was Sean Hannity's characterization after Thursday's debate, during an interview with Republican mayoral candidate Curtis Sliwa. Of course, being bashed by Hannity is to be expected for a progressive politician. Mamdani clearly saw value in the Fox News interview -- specifically his comments directly to Trump -- and he amplified them to his millions of followers on on Instagram and TikTok.\n\nClearly, Mandani's compelling family history -- born in Uganda to accomplished parents, filmmaker Mira Nair and professor Mahmood Mamdani -- and his supercharged political rise is catnip for magazine profile writers and long-form podcast hosts. And unlike, say, Bernie Sanders, Mamdani isn't averse to talking about himself, such as joking on \"The Breakfast Club\" are his brief rapper career as \"Young Cardamom.\"\n\nBut similar to Sanders, Mamdani makes a point of always returning to his core policy proposals: free buses and child care, and a rent freeze for rent-stabilized apartments. It's a timely economic message that appears to be resonating in the party.\n\nA Fox News poll conducted ahead of Thursday's debate found Mamdani leading Cuomo by 21 points, 49% - 28%, with Sliwa clocking in at 13%. Another recent poll, found Mamdani in the lead with 46%, followed by Cuomo (33%) and Sliwa (15%).\n\nLet's be clear: Not every politician is as nimble as Mamdani, who is young, charismatic, fluent in pop culture and social media. During the 2020 presidential primary, I spoke with Democratic operative Lis Smith about her candidate, Pete Buttigieg, who was appearing everywhere from conservative talk shows to TMZ. \"It's ultimately the candidate who determines the success of these things,\" she told me then. \"There's no magic recipe.\"\n\nOf course, media mastery alone isn't enough to win an election, or Buttigieg would've been on the 2020 ticket instead of Joe Biden. But it's hard to imagine a candidate winning in 2028 who isn't capable of reaching voters wherever they are in a fragmented media environment.\n\nAlready, we're seeing likely 2028 contenders making the rounds beyond traditional TV news shows. In recent months, Buttigieg has appeared on \"The Breakfast Club,\" \"On with Kara Swisher,\" \"Mo News,\" \"Pod Save America,\" and \"Flagrant,\" one of Trump's podcast pit-stops during the end of the 2024 campaign.\n\nMeanwhile, Governors Gavin Newsom, of California, and Andy Beshear, of Kentucky, launched their own podcasts this year. Newsom, who, like Buttigieg, also isn't afraid to mix it up to Fox News, kicked off his podcast with an interview with the late conservative activist Charlie Kirk, and emphasized the need to engage civilly with people you disagree with.\n\nThen there's Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who -- like Mamdani -- shocked the New York political establishment and has demonstrated social media savvy throughout her time in Congress. She's amassed more than 26 million followers on Instagram, TikTok, and X and is reportedly weighing a 2028 run.\n\nIn our fractured, deeply polarized, attention-drained age, candidates will, as always, need a strong message, but also the ability to convey it, creatively and authentically, across a variety of mediums.",

        "title": "WATCH: VA Secretary Doug Collins on the government shutdown, veterans' health care, military pay",
        "description": "Hi, everyone. Welcome to the Washington Times interview with Secretary of Veterans Affairs Doug Collins, the man who oversees veteran care and policies.\n\n[SWOYER] With the ongoing government shutdown, what is the impact on veterans and employee pay? And also, of course, there's questions about veteran care.\n\n[COLLINS] The good part about it is over time, it's always developed that we have, especially for our core of what we do, taking care of veterans, our health care system, all of those are open. They'll continue to stay open. Our piece of it paid. Our folks are paid because we're in an advanced appropriation. So those are always going to be taken care of. Disability payments are going to be taken care of, processing those are going to continue because of our funding status.\n\nWhat is cut back for us is some of our outwardly folks, some of our cemetery maintenance issues we have, also vocational rehab and education. So for some of our veterans who are in training to get new jobs or to apply for those, those are going to be impacted right now. Getting some help in our regional offices are shut down because of the shutdown. So we're about 97% fully operational. We got about 3%. But you have to understand, 3% for us is about 30,000 employees. So it's a larger footprint that we have. So we're very much balanced. We're very concerned about where the situation is to not go further. The further we go, the more what we'll call the outward-facing stuff will taper off with furloughed employees. But that's where we're at right now.\n\n[SWOYER] The top Democrat on the Veteran Affairs Committee, Senator Blumenthal, has recently said things like the shutdown, \"weakens veterans care.\" Specifically, he talked about cuts related to life-saving spinal cord injury. What is your response to that? Is it scare tactics?\n\n[COLLINS] Well, it's actually worse. It's a lie. And look, you can be a senator and you can be entitled to your own opinion. You just can't be entitled to your own facts. And to imply that in any way that we're cutting back on spinal cord injuries and anything else is abysmal conduct from a senator. And he ought to apologize, frankly. Especially when he's one of the ones cutting off funding to the federal government. Our spinal cord centers are open. So it's really, it's hurtful to have someone who should know, the ranking member of the committee, but yet says something that shows as if he's never heard of the VA.\n\nLook, he's done nothing but complain this whole year when we've tried to modernize our systems, how we've gotten better. We've cut our backlogs on disability claims by 100,000 almost. In less than four and a half months, we have been able to lower wait times, get better increased care, use community care. And all they're concerned about was union employees and things that are peripheral to what we do. The good senator can have his own opinion but he can't lie.\n\n[SWOYER] Is this just rhetoric related to the shutdown? You've sat through shutdowns as a member of congress. Do you think that the Democrats are going to have any sort of epiphany soon?\n\n[COLLINS] I think they will. But look, they're having to play very much to a very liberal base. The Chuck Schumer shutdown should be the AOC shutdown. It is a reaction to what happened in March. Some people get upset: \"Well, Doug, you know, you're saying the Democrat shut down.\" No, AP said Democrats shut down. The New Yorker said shutdown. So I'm just repeating what the mainstream media said. But it's true because what they've got to figure out what is it worth and the realization of what they're asking for. And they keep saying \"we don't want health care for illegals.\" I have a flyer on my desk in this office, in New York State where they put a flyer out, for 65 of undocumented workers to get health care. Medicare. That's federal.\n\nSo let's just don't play the game. The game is, is they're trying to get something. We'll see as they go forward.\n\n[SWOYER] It doesn't seem like polling really supports that. Gavin Newsom out in California actually looked at their Medicaid or what they were doing because of illegals.\n\n[COLLINS] It is, like I said, everybody's got to find their pressure point here. And it's how much was the fight? How much the fight going to be worth it? I think for them, they just got to decide, is this worth putting the country through because at the end of the day, they're going to be, they're the ones that's going to be keeping people military from getting paid. They're the one that's going to be continuing this, this painfulness of this shutdown.\n\n[SWOYER] This is before your time here, but you might remember from your years on Capitol Hill. About a decade ago, there was news about that the VA secretly had rescheduled veteran appointments.\n\n[COLLINS] I very much remember.\n\n[SWOYER] I think some of them, according to an IG report, had died waiting for their appointments and for their care, for their new appointments. I know it's been years, but are you monitoring the situation? Are there no more secret wait lists? What has been done?\n\n[COLLINS] No, in fact, that was one of the transitional moments in VA life. I was in Congress during that time. That was in 2013, 2014 timeframe. Phoenix, Augusta, Georgia, Atlanta, this is where this was coming out of. And out of that, you got the Choice Act, and that was the first step toward allowing veterans to use community care if our wait times were too long or they weren't able to get the care as quickly as they needed, which led into the Mission Act, which is under what we do now, they're working on the Access Act now. All of this is designed to get the veteran the best care quickly as possible. We've taken great steps to make sure that our veterans are getting the quality care they need. Wait times are not the best way to judge a hospital. In fact, we're the only hospital system it does. But the reason we do is because of what you just talked about. We had to find a metric in Congress to say, how do we hold them accountable?\n\nWatch the video for the full conversation.",

        "description": "The stretch of freeway is typically used by over 80,000 people daily.\n\nShrapnel from artillery rounds fired by the U.S. Marine Corps during a celebration in front of Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of War Pete Hegseth detonated prematurely and struck a patrol car, the California Highway Patrol said.\n\nThe artillery rounds were fired over Interstate 5 near Camp Pendleton in San Diego County as part of a military demonstration for the Marine Corps' 250th anniversary.\n\nThe live fire demonstration also coincided with \"No Kings\" protests against President Donald Trump and his administration that were occurring around Southern California and across the country.\n\nA 17-mile stretch of the busy freeway that connects Los Angeles to San Diego was shut down during the event by the California Highway Patrol. The stretch of freeway is typically used by over 80,000 people every day, according to the agency.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom's office said it was notified by the federal government Saturday morning that the military planned to shoot live artillery over the heavily traveled freeway, prompting highway patrol officers to temporarily close the freeway.\n\nLast week, the military said that mortar rounds would not be fired over the freeway and said no freeways or roads would be impacted by the event. Military officials said all activities would be strictly confined to training fields at Camp Pendleton and would not impact public areas.\n\nBut on Saturday morning, the federal government requested that the state change electronic highway signs to read \"LIVE WEAPONS OVER FREEWAY,\" according to the California Highway Patrol.\n\nFreeway signs all around Southern California warned drivers that live fire was in the vicinity of the freeway around Camp Pendleton.\n\nABC News has reached out to the Marine Corps, Camp Pendleton and the Trump administration for a comment.\n\nFor hours on Saturday, drivers in Southern California were stuck in gridlock on the freeway or had to take lengthy detours.\n\nDuring that time, shrapnel allegedly rained down on the freeway in the closure zone, according to CHP.\n\nIn a police report obtained by ABC News, CHP says a patrol SUV was struck with shrapnel. That SUV had \"an approximate two-inch by half-inch piece of shrapnel on the hood of the patrol vehicle,\" according to the report.\n\nThe agency says in the report that the shrapnel made a dent in the hood.\n\nAdditionally, patrol officers stated an officer working the freeway closure heard \"what sounded like 'pebbles' falling on his CHP BMW motorcycle.\"\n\nCHP says it immediately alerted the Marine Corps that a mortar round did not clear Interstate 5 and that shrapnel was falling around the freeway. At that point, the Marine Corps, according to the CHP, immediately cancelled firing additional live ordinance over the freeway.\n\nA safety sweep was conducted on the freeway to look for more shrapnel, but none was found.\n\nCamp Pendleton officials told Fox News Digital that an investigation has been initiated to determine the incident's root cause. \"The demonstration went through a rigorous safety evaluation, and deliberate layers of redundancy, to ensure the safety of fellow citizens,\" the statement to Fox reads in part.\n\nIn response to the apparent premature detonation and the firing of ordnances over the freeway, Newsom wrote on X on Sunday, \"We love our Marines and owe a debt of gratitude to Camp Pendleton, but next time, the Vice President and the White House shouldn't be so reckless with people's lives for their vanity projects.\"\n\nThe California Highway Patrol said it is requesting an after-action review with the federal government to discuss public safety.",

Gavin Newsom, who closed down a highway because of concerns about shells being fired over a busy thoroughfare.\n\nVice President JD Vance and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth attended the event honoring the 250th anniversary of the Marine Corps. Newsom lashed out at the Trump administration in the run up to the event, saying \"firing live rounds over a busy highway isn't just wrong - it's dangerous.\"\n\nWhile the Marines had said the demonstration would \"comport with established safety protocols\" and no roads would be closed, Newsom decided to close a 15-mile stretch of Interstate 5 that bisects Camp Pendleton, the primary connection between coastal San Diego County and Orange County.\n\nDuring the demonstration, \"an artillery round failed to clear the roadway and detonated midflight near Interstate 5 southbound,\" according to a Highway Patrol report. The round was fired at 1:46 p.m. local time from White's Beach, one of roughly 60 the Marines planned to fire, according to the report.\n\nMetal shrapnel struck a patrol vehicle and motorcycle. An officer described \"what sounded like 'pebbles'\" falling on his motorcycle, according to the report. Officers found a two-inch piece of shrapnel on the hood of an unoccupied patrol vehicle, which was dented.\n\nThe Highway Patrol notified the Marines of the incident and the military ceased firing live rounds. Nobody was injured. Patrol officers swept the highway and determined it was safe to reopen. It was closed from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. local time.\n\n\"This was an unusual and concerning situation,\" Highway Patrol Border Division Chief Tony Coronado said in a press release. \"It is highly uncommon for any live-fire or explosive training activity to occur over an active freeway.\"\n\nVance's spokeswoman referred questions to the Marines. Capt.

We are committed to determining the incident's root cause and applying findings to future missions.\"\n\nVance watched the demonstration standing atop a 7-ton military truck with his wife. It featured F-18 and F-35 flyovers, parachute landings, Navy SEALs swimming ashore, offshore destroyers and amphibious ships, simulated village explosions and MH-60 helicopters dropping additional SEALs over the water.\n\nThe Highway Patrol is recommending an \"after-action review into the planning, communication and coordination between federal, state, and local government around the event.\"",

        "title": "New California laws aim to stabilize state's wildfire insurance market",
        "description": "The recent rains may have lowered the threat of wildfire in the area, but the problem of maintaining fire insurance is a year-round problem for many in California. As a result, a number of new laws have just been adopted that aim to stabilize the home insurance market before and after a major catastrophe.\n\nCentral Marin Fire Battalion Chief Todd Lando said many homeowners are doing what they can to remove fuels around their homes. But that doesn't always come cheap.\n\n\"It's taken years of education and efforts to get outreach into the communities to help people understand what their real vulnerabilities are,\" said Lando. \"Especially in 'Zone Zero.' The first five feet around the house plays a big role, and sometimes, depending on what your property looks like, it could be a big expense. You may need to hire professionals.\"\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom just signed Assembly Bill 888. It establishes a grant program to help low and middle-income homeowners in high-fire risk areas to pay for the removal of flammable vegetation and install more fire-resistant roofs and materials on homes.\n\nAnother new law addresses how victims of wildfire are paid by their insurance companies. Currently, insurers of homes lost in declared disasters will only pay 30% of their policy limits for personal possessions unless homeowners supply a complete list of all that was lost.\n\n\"Rebuilding after a total loss is overwhelming,\" said Richard Otis, an attorney for a citizens' group called United Policyholders. \"People are forced to remember every toothbrush, pan, pair of shoes. It adds needless pain to an already traumatic experience. Survivors need space to heal. They need to be able to move on, not to be buried in paperwork in the past.\"\n\nSenate Bill 495 tried to stop that by requiring insurers to pay 100% of a policy's limits on personal property loss, without itemizing the possessions.\n\n\"In the process in the legislature, the insurance industry whittled that down,\" said Carmen Balber, executive director of Consumer Watchdog. \"So the bill, as it was signed by the governor last week, is 60% of that personal property coverage will be paid without an itemized list. But it still improves the situation for consumers who are being asked to itemize things in the wake of a fire and retraumatize them.\"\n\nWith many insurers drawing back from the market, many homeowners have been forced into the California FAIR Plan. It was meant to be the insurer of last resort, but has now grown to become the second-largest policy writer in the state.\n\n\"But the FAIR Plan was not designed to absorb the number of policyholders at the current rate,\" said California Assemblymember Lisa Calderon. \"This came to a head in February when the FAIR Plan requested financial assistance from its member companies to ensure claims continue to be paid from the Palisades and Eaton Fires. This measure provides the FAIR Plan additional resources to ensure they have adequate claims paying capacity.\"\n\nAB 226 helps stabilize the FAIR Plan by issuing state-backed bonds and lines of credit so insurance companies can spread out, over time, any bailouts of the FAIR Plan that may be necessary following a major disaster.\n\nFinally, SB 429 will begin the process of creating a state-wide wildfire risk model, generated by public universities, so that future pricing decisions won't rely solely on private, insurance-industry data.\n\n\"We want insurance. We need someone to provide it,\" Lando said. \"I think we need to do everything we can to make sure we can all keep it.\"",

        "description": "Jose Fabian is a web producer for CBS Bay Area where he reports on local crime, politics and breaking news. He studied political science and journalism at Sacramento State and was born and raised in Northern California.\n\nPresident Trump on Sunday said he would be sending the National Guard to San Francisco to make it \"great again.\"\n\nThe pledge came during a Sunday interview with Fox News as Mr. Trump was talking about the National Guard in Chicago.\n\n\"We're going to go to San Francisco, and we're going to make it great,\" Mr. Trump responded when asked if he would be sending troops to the Bay Area next. \"It won't be great if it keeps going like this.\"\n\nIt's the second time in less than a week Mr. Trump has mentioned National Guard troops possibly being sent to a second California city, following the deployment to Los Angeles in June.\n\nOn Oct. 15, in comments directed to FBI Director Kash Patel, Mr. Trump said he was going to be \"strongly recommending ... that you start looking at San Francisco.\"\n\nSan Francisco leaders have spoken out against federal intervention in the city several times, saying they had sufficient local resources to maintain law and order.\n\n\"We have this issue under control,\" said San Francisco District Attorney Brooke Jenkins at a recent public safety event. \"We need to be allowed to continue the progress that we are making.\"\n\nHer comments were in response to Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff expressing support for a National Guard presence in San Francisco, a statement he later retracted.\n\nMayor Daniel Lurie has avoided directly criticizing a possible National Guard deployment, instead highlighting the city's crime drop and the rise in police recruits.\n\n\"We are working relentlessly every day and that public safety is our number one priority. We have issues, and we're addressing it by our Rebuilding the Ranks program,\" Lurie said on Oct. 15.\n\nMore recently, on Friday, he highlighted that Dreamforce, a large tech conference, happened with no notable crime reported.\n\nMr. Trump has said there is support for federal intervention among government officials, but he has not said who he is referencing.\n\n\"The difference is I think they want us in San Francisco,\" the president said on Sunday.\n\nIn his Oct. 15 speech, he said the San Francisco recommendation was being made at the \"request of government officials.\"\n\nIn response to the Sunday interview, Gov. Gavin Newsom's office responded on X, saying, \"No, we do not.\"\n\nMr. Trump claimed he could use the Insurrection Act to send troops if he encounters legal pushback.\n\n\"That's unquestioned power,\" Mr. Trump said. \"Our cities that are Democrat-run, exclusively just about, are unsafe cities. They're a disaster.\"\n\nIllinois Gov. JB Pritzker, who has had troops sent to his state, has previously said it wouldn't be legal for Mr. Trump to invoke the Insurrection Act.\n\n\"There has to be an insurrection in order for him to be allowed to invoke it. Again, he can say anything he wants. But if the Constitution means anything -- and I guess we are all questioning that right now, but the courts will make the determination -- if the Constitution means anything, the Insurrection Act cannot be invoked to send them in because they want to fight crime,\" Pritzker said on ABC News' \"This Week.\"",

        "description": "Dean Fioresi is a web producer for CBS Los Angeles. He covers breaking news throughout Southern California. When he's not writing about local events, he enjoys focusing on sports and entertainment.\n\nCalifornia Highway Patrol officials say that a patrol vehicle was struck by shrapnel from an artillery round that was fired during Saturday's live-fire event at Camp Pendleton to celebrate the U.S. Marine Corps' 250th anniversary.\n\nThe metal shrapnel came from an \"explosive ordnance fired over the Interstate 5 freeway\" that had \"detonated overhead prematurely,\" CHP said in a news release. They reported that the falling piece of shrapnel damaged the patrol vehicle just after 1:45 p.m.\n\n\"The incident happened in an area where CHP officers were supporting a traffic break along I-5 near Camp Pendleton during an exceptional U.S. Marine Corps live-fire training demonstration over the freeway, and where the CHP had elected to stop traffic during the live-fire exercise,\" said CHP's release.\n\nNo injuries were reported, and CHP officers informed USMC personnel at the scene, who canceled any additional firing of live ordnance over the freeway. The surrounding area was also swept by law enforcement.\n\n\"This was an unusual and concerning situation,\" said a statement from CHP Border Division Chief Tony Coronado. \"It is highly uncommon for any live-fire or explosive training activity to occur over an active freeway. As a Marine myself, I have tremendous respect for our military partners, but my foremost responsibility is ensuring the safety of the people of California and the officers who protect them.\"\n\nCHP officers filed an internal report on the incident, recommending an additional after-action review to strengthen further protocols and communication between federal, state and local government for any future demonstrations or training near public roadways.\n\nA spokesperson for the Marine Corps told CBS News that the incident was under investigation.\n\n\"We are aware of the report of a possible airborne detonation of a 155mm artillery round outside the designated impact area during the U.S. Marine Corps Amphibious Capabilities Demonstration at Camp Pendleton, CA, Oct. 18,\" said a statement from USMC, in part. \"The demonstration went through a rigorous safety evaluation, and deliberate layers of redundancy, to ensure the safety of fellow citizens. Following established safety protocols, firing was suspended. No injuries occurred and the demonstration concluded as scheduled. An investigation has been initiated. We are committed to determining the incident's root cause and applying findings to future missions.\"\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom addressed the incident on social media.\n\n\"Donald Trump and JD Vance put lives at risk to put on a show,\" said his post on X. \"If you want to honor our troops, open the government and pay them.\"\n\nThe event caused some controversy in Southern California as the heavily traveled stretch of freeway was closed between Harbor Drive and Basilone Road from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. The decision was not announced until Saturday morning, despite speculation earlier in the week that drew criticism from Newsom.\n\nThe celebration brought 15,000 military personnel and veterans together, including Vice President JD Vance, a USMC veteran, and Secretary of War Pete Hegseth at the sprawling military base that spans from southern San Diego County to Orange County.",

        "title": "When is Diwali, why is it celebrated? What to know about the Hindu Festival of Lights",
        "description": "Diwali or Deepavali celebrates the \"victory of good over evil during the course of five days,\" according to the Hindu American Foundation.\n\nBring out the sparkle and light up those lamps; it's time for Diwali celebrations.\n\nMillions of Hindus and South Asians across the globe will celebrate the annual Festival of Lights on Monday, Oct. 20, by praying, gathering, partying, having dinners and eating festive foods.\n\n\"One of the most celebrated Hindu festivals, Diwali or Deepavali commemorates the victory of good over evil during the course of five days,\" the Hindu American Foundation says, explaining \"the word refers to rows of diyas -- or clay lamps -- which are put all around homes and places of worship.\"\n\nHere's what you need to know about Diwali.\n\nWhat is Diwali, the 'Festival of Lights'?\n\nThe word Diwali is derived from the Sanskrit word Deepavali, meaning \"row of lights,\" which devotees light outside their homes during the festival to represent the light that guards against spiritual darkness and symbolizes good over evil.\n\n\"The light from these lamps symbolizes the illumination within all of us, which can overcome ignorance, represented by darkness,\" the Hindu American Foundation says.\n\nThe lights are also meant to honor and invite the goddess Lakshmi, who is associated with agriculture and abundance, to enter and bless their homes, temples and other public spaces. Hindu belief holds that Lakshmi cannot enter a dark space, according to the Smithsonian's National Museum of Asian Art.\n\nThe festival, which is spread over a period of five days, also marks the beginning of the new year in the Hindu calendar and celebrates the year's last rice-crop harvest, according to Journal Storage (JSTOR).\n\nWhile Diwali is a major religious festival for Hindus, the Associated Press reported that Sikhs, Jains and Buddhists also observe it, and that the holiday's origin story varies depending on the region. However, all of them follow the same underlying themes of good triumphing over evil and light over darkness.\n\nFor example, for Sikhs, Diwali celebrates the sixth Guru, who serves as a source of inspiration and a symbol for freedom. The guru was in prison and refused to leave prison without the other 52 political prisoners being released. The day of Diwali celebrates his release, along with the political prisoners he fought for. While the reason behind the celebrations may differ, to commemorate the festival, Sikhs will also go to the Gurdwara to pray, meditate, light diyas and set off fireworks.\n\nInitially a religious event, Diwali has evolved over the years into a festive occasion, much like Christmas and Hannukkah, with people of all communities and religions joining in to celebrate.\n\nWhen is Diwali?\n\nDiwali is celebrated during the Hindu month of Kartik, which typically falls between the middle of October and the middle of November. This year, Diwali begins on Monday, Oct. 20.\n\nThe festival is celebrated over five days, and Dhanteras, the preparation period leading up to the peak of Diwali, begins two days earlier on Saturday, Oct. 18.\n\nHow is Diwali celebrated?\n\nDiwali celebrations begin with devotees deep cleaning their homes and surroundings to prepare for the goddess's arrival, according to the Smithsonian. The next day, devotees decorate using clay lamps, candles and other lights, drawing colorful patterns of flowers, powder, rice or sand on the floor, which is an artistic practice called rangoli that's meant to bring good luck.\n\nThe main celebration takes place on the night of the third day, which marks the end of the Hindu calendar year. Devotees dress up in their finest outfits, make offerings to Lakshmi, light fireworks and sparklers, and enjoy a sweet feast.\n\nOver the next two days, the celebrations continue as people host gatherings and visit family and friends to celebrate the new year.\n\nFor Hindus, Diwali is also a time for dana (charitable giving) and seva (selfless service), according to the Hindu American Foundation.\n\nIs Diwali a federal holiday?\n\nWhile Diwali itself is not a federal holiday, several states, including Pennsylvania and Connecticut, recognize it as a state holiday, according to the Los Angeles Times. Schools, government offices and businesses aren't required to close in observance, CBS News reported. On Oct. 10, California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill by Assemblymember Ash Kalra (D-San Jos\u00e9) to designate Diwali as an official state holiday. The bill, which takes effect on Jan. 1, 2026, will allow community colleges and public schools to close on Diwali and give state employees the choice to take the day off with pay.\n\nThe New Jersey Department of Education allows its students to observe Diwali, so they can take the day off without any consequences. In New York City, public schools are closed on Diwali under an education law that was enacted in 2023.\n\nContributing: Michelle Shen, USA TODAY / Mariyam Muhammad, Columbus Dispatch\n\nSaman Shafiq is a trending news reporter for USA TODAY.

        "title": "Trump Administration: Latest News and Live Updates",
        "description": "Gavin Newsom, the Democratic governor of the state, deemed it an \"absurd show of force\" and \"dangerous.\"\n\nMr. Vance used a speech in front of hundreds of Marines to attack Democrats over the government shutdown, referring to the impasse as the \"Schumer shutdown,\" a dig at Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the minority leader. Throughout the day, protesters filled streets in American cities, including nearby Los Angeles and San Diego, lambasting the Trump administration's domestic agenda and its consolidation of power.\n\nWhat the White House had initially planned as a celebration of the country's 250th birthday and of the might of the Marines became half of a revealing split-screen: As the likely heir of Mr. Trump's political movement showcased the power of the military over the objections of a state governor, thousands of people across the country protested a president they accused of using his power like a king.\n\nThe overlapping events amounted to a snapshot of the fractured state of American society and of the rising tensions between the federal government and Democratic leaders, who have clashed repeatedly with Mr. Trump in recent months over his use of the military in domestic affairs.\n\n\"The values Americans cherish are under assault by\" Mr. Trump, Mr. Newsom said in a social media post on Saturday. He said California would continue \"peacefully pushing back against the Trump Administration's authoritarian takeover.\"\n\nMr. Vance's aides accused Mr. Newsom of stoking fear, saying the Marine Corps had determined that the exercise at Camp Pendleton did not pose a threat. \"It's pretty shocking that Gavin Newsom knows so little about what goes on at one of the most important military installations in his state,\" said William Martin, Mr. Vance's communications director.\n\nMr. Newsom said that he simply wanted more communication about the plans. State officials said they had barely received any information about the demonstration from federal officials, and that were told earlier in the week that the demonstration would not involve firing munitions across the freeway.\n\nWhile the Trump administration argued that the exercise was routine, representatives for the Marine Corps did not answer questions about how many times it had previously fired live munitions over the California freeway.\n\nBefore the M777 howitzers fired from Red Beach at Camp Pendleton, California officials closed Interstate 5, the heavily traveled corridor between Los Angeles and San Diego, for hours. The state said it had made the decision because of potential hazards from the demonstration.\n\nThe Marines initially planned to fire multiple rounds from Red Beach east over the highway. But the exercise was eventually scaled back, effectively a compromise amid the dispute between federal and state officials.\n\nDuring his speech, Mr. Vance, who served a tour in Iraq and worked in media relations in the Marine Corps, said that the entirety of the demonstration -- the live ammunition, the parachuters descending from the sky, the Navy seals swimming ashore, the F35 jets flying overhead -- made his \"heart sing as your vice president.\"\n\nHe praised the storied history of the Marines. But as Mr. Trump has done in military addresses in recent months, he leaned eagerly into politics, casting the troops as victims of a progressive cultural agenda.\n\nHe questioned the military diversity programs the Trump administration had gutted. \"It is not our diversity that makes us stronger. It is our common purpose,\" Mr. Vance said.\n\nCriticizing Democrats, Mr. Vance pledged that the administration would ensure troops were paid during the government shutdown, after Mr. Trump directed the Defense Department to use \"all available funds\" to do so, a short-term fix that does not apply to hundreds of thousands of other federal employees.\n\n\"He wanted me to tell each and every single one of you that he's proud of you, that he loves you, and that despite the Schumer shutdown, he is going to do everything he can to make sure you get paid exactly as you deserve,\" Mr. Vance said, referring to Mr. Trump.\n\nMr. Vance, appearing to recognize the boundaries he was testing, added: \"I know we're here to talk about the Marine Corps. But I have got to get just a little political. Because congressional Democrats seem to want to keep the government shut down even though it would mean that a lot of you would not get your paycheck.\"\n\nDavid Nelson, a former captain and lawyer in the Marines, called Mr. Vance's speech detailing the history of the corps \"stirring,\" saying it had made him feel proud that he had joined the Marines in 1965. But he noted that the speech was delivered close to Los Angeles, where Mr. Trump had deployed hundreds of Marines earlier this year following protests over immigration raids.\n\n\"Since the primary purpose of the Marine Corps is to protect our country against foreign enemies, I do hope that Marines are not relegated to assisting with local law enforcement activities, potentially pitting U.S. Marines against Americans,\" said Mr. Nelson, who watched the speech on television.\n\nNorth of the Red Beach demonstration area of Camp Pendleton, where the sound of military helicopters smothered the noise of rolling breakers, Sara Kennedy, a longtime San Clemente resident, wondered why Mr. Vance was overseeing the military exercise when long-term pay for federal workers remained in jeopardy.\n\n\"It's frustrating that we're having to live through this type of time where it seems like peoples' lives don't matter, for a show,\" said Ms. Kennedy, 41.\n\nLarry St Marie, 77, a retired longshoreman and Vietnam War veteran who lives in San Clemente, did come out to see the military show on Saturday. He said he had noticed a decline in \"flag wavers\" as the country had become more polarized.\n\nHe found himself questioning how the country -- and the government -- had reached such a divisive state, he added.\n\n\"It's crazy why we're in this position,\" Mr. St Marie said. \"Doesn't make sense to me. It should have never got to this point.\"",

        "description": "Campaign ads for Democrats Mikie Sherrill, top, and Abigail Spanberger, link their Republican opponents to President Trump.Credit...From top: Greater Garden State, Spanberger for VA Governor\n\nIn New Jersey, the most expensive attack ad in the governor's race so far this fall accuses the Republican nominee, Jack Ciattarelli, of wanting to be \"the Trump of Trenton.\"\n\nIn Virginia, Abigail Spanberger, the Democratic nominee for governor, has spent millions of dollars casting her Republican rival, Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, as an acolyte of President Trump and supporter of his policies. \"Sears speaks for Trump,\" the narrator warns in one recent ad.\n\nAnd in California, a blizzard of TV ads has urged voters to fight against Mr. Trump -- by backing a ballot measure to redraw the state's congressional lines. \"We can stop Trump cold,\" Gavin Newsom, the state's Democratic governor, says in that campaign's most-aired ad.\n\nAfter a year of soul-searching and introspection by Democrats about what they should stand for after losing the White House and Senate in 2024, the party is largely coalescing behind the same message that has united it for the past decade: stopping Donald J. Trump.\n\nFrom coast to coast, the tactical decision to continue centering Mr. Trump in advertising in the closing stretch of 2025 contests has left some party strategists concerned about a missed opportunity to forge a more forward-looking vision.\n\n\"I worry that Donald Trump is like crack cocaine for our party,\" said Celinda Lake, a veteran Democratic pollster.\n\nMs. Lake acknowledged that running against an unpopular president could prove smart politics in the short term, revving up the Democratic base in states he lost last year, such as California, New Jersey and Virginia. But she warned it was urgent for Democrats to begin rebuilding their own beleaguered brand. The party's standing notably has not improved in polls, even as Mr. Trump's own image has sunk.\n\n\"Trump is very seductive because when you put up an ad that's anti-Trump, you get a lot of small-dollar contributions, you get a lot of activists saying, 'Great job!'\" Ms. Lake said. \"The biggest thing the Democrats need to do is not the negative but the positive. We have to offer an alternative.\"\n\nMs. Spanberger and the Democratic nominee for governor in New Jersey, Representative Mikie Sherrill, have run positive ads about their own agendas and accomplishments. Ms. Sherrill's service as a Navy helicopter pilot, in particular, has been spliced into numerous spots. And supporters have made the case that victories by these two moderate women with national security credentials would help reset the party's image.\n\nBut the airwaves have been cluttered with Trump-related attacks, according to a New York Times review of the television ads this year compiled by the ad-tracking service AdImpact. Ms. Sherrill linked Mr. Ciattarelli and Mr. Trump in an ad as early as the spring, even before she had won the Democratic primary. Ms. Spanberger's campaign has spent more than $6 million on ads linking Ms. Earle-Sears and Mr. Trump, records show, even though Mr. Trump has not technically endorsed Ms. Earle-Sears.\n\nBrad Todd, a veteran Republican admaker and political strategist, mocked Democrats for using Mr. Trump -- over and over -- to rile up their liberal base.\n\n\"If I were running a Democratic campaign, I would be attempting to broaden my coalition beyond a visceral hatred of Trump,\" Mr. Todd said.\n\n\"To get a mandate to govern,\" he added, \"you have to win over voters in the conflicted middle.\"\n\nThe 2025 elections are playing out in mostly more favorable terrain for Democrats. In the 2024 presidential race, Mr. Trump lost both states with governor's races this year, and he was routed badly in California.\n\nYet Democratic strategists know that red states and districts will be crucial to the party's chances in the 2026 midterm elections, in terms of both winning a House majority and trying to flip the Senate, which would require winning in at least three states Mr. Trump carried in 2024.\n\n\"I don't think anti-Trump will be a sufficient message in the 2026 midterm and the 2028 general to mobilize and persuade the kind of voters who have been eroding from the Democratic Party,\" said Terrance Woodbury, a Democratic pollster who specializes in studying younger voters and minority groups. At the same time, Mr. Woodbury, who is involved in the California redistricting ballot campaign, said his own research showed that Mr. Trump was the biggest motivator for voters right now.\n\n\"As long as Trump is on the political stage, he can't not be part of the political conversation,\" he said. \"He can't be the entire political conversation.\"\n\nIn Virginia, Spanberger campaign ads have highlighted Ms. Earle-Sears's support for Mr. Trump's signature budget legislation, and her refusal to criticize federal work force layoffs in a television interview. \"It's a real issue that Sears supports Trump, not Virginians,\" one of the ads says.\n\nAn exasperated Ms. Earle-Sears interrupted Ms. Spanberger's closing statement at a recent debate to declare, \"If I were taking a drink for every 'Trump' that she said, I tell you we would be drunk by now.\"\n\nTaNisha Cameron, a spokeswoman for Ms. Spanberger, said in a statement that \"every day through Election Day, we will remind voters of the contrast in this race.\"\n\nIn New Jersey, a group called Greater Garden State linked to the Democratic Governors Association has spent more than $2 million on an ad showing a photo of Mr. Ciattarelli and Mr. Trump together and calling him \"100% MAGA.\"\n\nThe Trump-themed ads have been so omnipresent -- including some in Spanish -- that the Ciattarelli campaign felt compelled to respond in its own ads.\n\n\"New Jersey's a mess, and all Mikie Sherrill wants to talk about is President Trump,\" Mr. Ciattarelli complained in one spot. \"Come on. What does the president have to do with rising property taxes and higher electricity bills?\"\n\nThere could be more to come. Mr. Ciattarelli gave Mr. Trump an \"A\" grade at a recent debate, and the Sherrill campaign has hit him for not breaking with the president on his decision to withhold funds for the Gateway tunnel project connecting New Jersey and Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan.\n\n\"While Mikie Sherrill has focused her entire campaign on how much she hates Donald Trump, people here in New Jersey are focused on who can fix the state and only one candidate is talking about that,\" said Chris Russell, an adviser to Mr. Ciattarelli.\n\nIn one of the other high-profile races of 2025, for New York City mayor, the Democratic nominee, Zohran Mamdani, has drawn attention for his success in making his campaign about an ambitious agenda of free buses, universal child care and a rent freeze. He has also swiped at Andrew M. Cuomo, the former governor who is running as an independent in the general election, by linking him to Mr. Trump for the president's efforts to meddle in the race.\n\nIn California, Mr. Trump is at the center of Mr. Newsom's bid to redraw the state's congressional maps and counter the partisan gerrymander in Texas pushed through at the president's behest. Mr. Newsom has recorded multiple ads about the president's role and the campaign has recruited surrogates including Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York to warn about Mr. Trump.\n\nMeanwhile, Tom Steyer, the Democratic financier who once bankrolled a campaign to impeach Mr. Trump before his own failed presidential campaign, is spending money to run anti-Trump ads.\n\nHe announced a $12 million campaign in favor of Proposition 50, the redistricting measure, that imagines an angry Mr. Trump throwing fast food after the measure passes in November. The ad's tagline is straightforward: \"Stick it to Trump.\"\n\nThe anti-Trump theme has trickled down the ballot, too.\n\nIn at least two races for Virginia's House of Delegates, Democratic candidates have run ads linking Republican rivals to Mr. Trump. And in the race for Virginia attorney general, Jay Jones, the embattled Democratic nominee, has made linking the Republican incumbent, Jason Miyares, to Mr. Trump a centerpiece of his advertising. Mr. Jones's campaign has threatened to come undone after the revelation of private text messages discussing the hypothetical killing of a Republican lawmaker.\n\n\"When it comes to standing up to Trump, Jason Miyares is too weak,\" the narrator says in one Jones ad. The Miyares campaign has countered by accusing Mr. Jones of being weak on crime.\n\nGeoff Garin, a Democratic pollster, said that ignoring an unpopular president who motivates voters would make no sense for the party.\n\n\"A lot of Democratic voters look at Trump as an emergency and an emergency happening in real time,\" Mr. Garin said. \"Regardless of how they feel about anything else, standing up to Trump is a really important motivator for them.\" In that way, Mr. Garin called the 2025 races \"a precursor to what will be very much a checks-and-balances election in 2026.\"\n\nBut Chris LaCivita, who served as a top strategist for Mr. Trump's 2024 campaign, said Democrats were stuck running a \"one-dimensional strategy.\"\n\n\"It's all anti-President Trump -- that's all they can speak to,\" Mr. LaCivita said. \"They have literally nothing to run on that helps the American people and the middle class.\"",

        "description": "The leader of a labor union in Southern California who was arrested while protesting an immigration raid earlier this year will have his felony obstruction charge reduced to a misdemeanor, court records show.\n\nDavid Huerta had been charged with obstruction, resistance or opposition to a federal officer - a class A felony, according to a Friday filing by Acting U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli in federal court.\n\nHowever, prosecutors filed a proposed order Saturday seeking dismissal without prejudice of the original felony charge of conspiracy to impede an officer.\n\nThe Associated Press sent an email Saturday seeking comment from the U.S. Attorney's office.\n\nAFL-CIO President Liz Shuler said in a statement Friday that Huerta was simply observing an Immigration and Customs Enforcement workplace raid to ensure workers were being treated fairly and was unfairly arrested and charged.\n\n\"This is a gross abuse of power by an administration hell-bent on punishing its perceived enemies and attacking immigrants, the statement said.\n\nHuerta, president of the Service Employees International Union California, was arrested on June 6 while protesting outside a business in Los Angeles where federal agents were investigating suspected immigration violations.\n\nA crowd of people gathered outside yelling at the officers. Huerta sat down in front of a vehicular gate and encouraged others to walk in circles to try to prevent law enforcement from going in or out, a special agent for Homeland Security Investigations, which is part of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, wrote in an earlier federal court filing.\n\nAn officer told Huerta to leave, then put his hands on Huerta to move him out of the way of a vehicle, the agent wrote. Huerta pushed back and the officer pushed Huerta to the ground and arrested him, according to the filing. Huerta was injured during the arrest and was hospitalized as a result, the union said.\n\nHuerta was later released from federal custody on a $50,000 bond.\n\nHuerta's union represents hundreds of thousands of janitors, security officers and other workers across California. His arrest became a rallying cry for immigrant advocates across the country as they called for his release and an end to President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown. SEIU officials protested in Washington, D.C., in support of Huerta's release.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom and other Democratic leaders denounced the arrest. Newsom wrote in a statement then that Huerta is a \"respected leader, a patriot, and an advocate for working people.\"\n\nAbbe David Lowell and Marilyn Bednarski, Huerta's attorneys, said in a statement that they will seek \"the speediest trial\" to vindicate him.\n\n\"In the four months that have passed since David's arrest. it has become even clearer there were no grounds for charging him and certainly none for the way he was treated,\" they wrote. \"This case is not a good-faith pursuit of justice but a bald act of retaliation, designed to silence dissent and punish opposition. It reflects the Trump Administration's continued weaponization of prosecutorial power against its perceived opponents.\"",

        "description": "Vice President JD Vance, the first Marine in history to serve as second-in-command, gave a fiery speech at Camp Pendleton in California on Saturday to help celebrate the Marine Corps anniversary. (Credit: POOL)\n\nVice President JD Vance joined Marines and sailors at Camp Pendleton in California on Saturday for the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Marine Corps, telling the crowd that the Corps remains ready to fight and ready to win.\n\nThe anniversary event included an amphibious assault demonstration on Red Beach, speeches from military leaders and cabinet officials, and a reminder from Vance that he is the first Marine to serve as vice president.\n\nHelicopters roared overhead and amphibious vehicles surged through the surf as Marines charged the beach to open the ceremony. Second Lady Usha Vance accompanied her husband to watch the display while families shaded their eyes and Ospreys thundered overhead.\n\nThis year's ceremony marked a quarter millennium since the Continental Congress first authorized the Marine Corps in 1775.\n\nNEWSOM CLASHES WITH WHITE HOUSE OVER MARINE CORPS ANNIVERSARY CELEBRATION HIGHWAY CLOSURE\n\nGeneral Eric Smith, Commandant of the Marine Corps, told the crowd that what they were seeing was the sound and look of freedom. He described the Corps as America's \"911 force\" and warned that Marines must be ready for whatever comes next.\n\n\"The next fight is coming,\" he said. \"Marines will be ready. Ready to fight. Ready to win.\"\n\nThe next fight is coming. Marines will be ready. Ready to fight. Ready to win.\n\n-- General Eric Smith, Commandant of the United States Marine Corps\n\n\"When it matters most, it's not technology or equipment that wins the day, but the dependability, decisiveness and character of the Marine or sailor who wields it,\" Smith said. He ended by thanking families and offering a blessing for their sacrifices.\n\nVP VANCE'S CAMP ACCUSES CALIFORNIA GOV. GAVIN NEWSOM OF DISSEMINATING 'FAKE NEWS' AHEAD OF MARINES CELEBRATION\n\nSecretary of War Pete Hegseth then delivered one of the day's most fiery addresses. A combat veteran himself, he told the Marines that the Corps stood strong when others wavered.\n\n\"I'm not supposed to say this, really not. But I think you guys might be my favorite,\" Hegseth said.\n\nHe tied the Corps to the administration's broader theme of America First, peace through strength, and common sense at every turn. Hegseth reminded the crowd that while many different faces fill the ranks, unity of mission is the true strength of the Corps.\n\n\"The truth is, your diversity is not your strength. Never has been. Your strength is in your unity of purpose. It's in your shared mission. It's in your oath to the Constitution. It's the bond that turns individuals into single-minded fighting units. You see, you are set apart. You're not civilians. You're devil dogs, leathernecks, United States Marines,\" the Secretary said, drawing cheers.\n\nThe crowd erupted when Vance took the stage.\n\n\"God bless you, Marines,\" he began, smiling as chants of \"Oorah!\" echoed back. He quickly reminded them that he's the first Marine to hold the office of vice president. \"From one Marine to another, thank you for your service,\" he said.\n\n\"I've also got to give a special shout out to the incredible display that we saw earlier today. It made my heart sing,\" Vance said. \"As your vice president, and it was a testament to the core strength and unbeatable power. It reminded me why I am so proud to have worn the uniform, to be one among your ranks, and to be the very first vice president to have been a United States Marine.\"\n\nVance used his speech to honor heroes, remember the fallen and reflect on his own service. He mentioned Medal of Honor recipient Sgt. Dakota Meyer who served in Afghanistan, Navy corpsman Charles Cram who helped raise the flag at Iwo Jima, and Navy aviator Elmer Royce Williams who survived the longest dogfight in American history.\n\nTRUMP DECLARES 'REAWAKENING' OF 'WARRIOR SPIRIT,' UNWAVERING SUPPORT FOR MILITARY: 'I HAVE YOUR BACKS'\n\nThe vice president mixed solemnity with humor that fellow Marines recognized immediately. He joked about the \"E-4 Mafia\" and shared a story about a gunnery sergeant who once saved him from signing a 22% interest used car loan by steering him to Navy Federal Credit Union.\n\n\"That gunny's leadership didn't just save me money,\" Vance said. \"It taught me that Marines look out for each other.\"\n\nVance's remarks included a particular story from boot camp. Recruits queued for Catholic or Protestant church services and Vance, referring to himself in the third person as, \"recruit,\" called himself an atheist.\n\n\"Get in the Catholic line,\" the drill instructor snapped. That punchline, Vance joked, \"wouldn't work in the Biden administration.\"\n\nVance also took aim at Democrats in Congress over the government shutdown, promising that the administration would fight to ensure enlisted Marines are paid.\n\n\"We will do everything possible to make sure enlisted Marines get paid,\" he said. \"Political battles in Washington should not come at the expense of troops and their families.\"\n\nHe tied the 250th anniversary back to the Corps' beginnings at Tun Tavern in Philadelphia in 1775. He named battles that define Marine history: from Belleau Wood and Iwo Jima to the Chosin Reservoir, Khe Sanh, Ramadi, Fallujah and Helmand, and told the audience that every generation of the Corps shares the same common purpose.\n\n\"Every single person here bleeds Marine Corps green,\" Vance said. \"It is our common purpose that carries us forward.\"\n\nEvery single person here bleeds Marine Corps green.\n\n-- Vice President JD Vance\n\nVance reminded East Coast Marines swatting sand fleas at Parris Island that their bond is the same as those climbing the hills of California. He spoke of his pride in wearing the Corps' uniform and closed with words that Marines have heard before but welcomed on their birthday.\n\n\"Keep kicking a--. Keep taking names. Semper Fidelis, Marines. Happy 250th birthday. God bless you,\" he said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe ceremony ended with the roar of the crowd as the day carried reminders of sacrifice, grit and unity.\n\nThe Department of War, Navy, and Vance's office did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

Gavin Newsom, D-Calif., to similarly fight back against the Trump administration.\n\nFINAL STRETCH: MAMDANI'S LARGE LEAD SHRINKING AS CUOMO GAINS GROUND IN NYC MAYORAL RACE\n\nMamdani himself has applauded Newsom's leadership rejecting Trump's second-term through judicial action, particularly when Trump sent the National Guard to Los Angeles during protests rejecting U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement deportations.\n\nTrump has since sent the National Guard to major cities, including Washington, D.C., Chicago, Portland, Oregon, and Memphis, Tennessee, to combat crime.\n\nHe has also threatened to cut federal funding to New York City if Mamdani is elected mayor.\n\n\"I don't think he's afraid of Trump in the least,\" Gail Kelly, a lawyer who lives in Breezy Point, Queens, who said she is voting for Mamdani, told Fox News Digital in Times Square.\n\nKelly said she is \"tired\" of former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who lost the Democratic primary to Mamdani in June and is now running as an independent candidate, said she is \"not that thrilled with Curtis Sliwa,\" the Republican nominee.\n\nNEW POLLS REVEAL MAMDANI HAS COMMANDING LEAD OVER RIVALS WEEKS FROM ELECTION DAY\n\nBrad, another Mamdani voter who lives in Gowanus, Brooklyn, and attended Saturday's \"No Kings\" rally, said Trump and Cuomo are \"fascists.\"\n\n\"Cuomo is a fascist as well,\" Brad said. \"He is also a sexual abuser. Mamdani, honestly, I don't know if he's got good ideas. I don't think a lot of ideas are gonna work, but he's got optimism, he cares about the people in the city, he cares about people's lives. That's good enough.\"\n\nCuomo resigned as New York governor in 2021 following multiple sexual harassment allegations that he has denied. Rich Azzopardi, a Cuomo campaign spokesperson, fired back at Brad's charge when reached for comment.\n\n\"Andrew Cuomo passed a $15 minimum wage, paid family leave, made marriage equality the law of the land, made college tuition free for nearly 80 percent of CUNY students and protected a women's right to choose by codifying Row vs. Wade into state law. Whomever said that clearly doesn't know what any of that word salad means. Send me their address, I'll be happy to send them a dictionary on me,\" Azzopardi said.\n\nAnnelice Morales, a Mamdani voter who lives on Manhattan's Upper East Side, said Mamdani's transparency is refreshing.\n\n\"I just think people, like Cuomo, have been in power for a really long time, and they abuse power,\" Morales told Fox News Digital while marching in the \"No Kings\" rally.\n\nMorales said she \"100%\" hopes Mamdani will fight back against Trump.\n\n\"He has a message to improve lives, the material needs of the New Yorkers,\" Lenny, a Lower East Side resident who is voting for Mamdani in November, said on Saturday.\n\nWhen asked if he wants Mamdani to fight back against Trump, Lenny said, \"Just uphold the law. It's that simple.\"\n\nMamdani has a 21-point lead among New York City registered voters: 49% back Mamdani, while 28% go for Cuomo and 13% favor Sliwa, according to the latest Fox News poll.\n\nVoters will elect a new mayor of New York City on Nov. 4 as Mayor Eric Adams suspended his re-election campaign last month.\n\nWhile those who spoke to Fox News Digital at Saturday's \"No Kings\" rally in Manhattan said they were voting for Mamdani in the upcoming election, the democratic socialist candidate did not advertise that he was attending.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nMamdani's campaign did not respond to inquiries about whether he was attending any \"No Kings\" rallies.\n\nMeanwhile, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who has endorsed and campaigned for Mamdani, headlined a \"No Kings\" rally in Washington, D.C., on Saturday.\n\nFox News Digital reached out to the White House for comment but did not immediately hear back.",

        "description": "As many as 100,000 were expected to demonstrate in Los Angeles on Saturday as the second round of \"No Kings\" protests took place across the nation.\n\nThe protests, which organizers frame as choosing \"democracy over dictatorship,\" are against the policies of President Trump, like increased immigration enforcement and deployment of National Guard troops in American cities like LA.\n\nIn Southern California, protesters gathered in areas across Los Angeles, San Diego, Orange County and the Inland Empire. The largest was expected to be in downtown LA, with protesters meeting at Gloria Molina Grand Park.\n\nKatherine Schorr, who demonstrated in Santa Monica, called participation in these protests \"imperative\" in denying what she called a \"fascist regime.\"\n\n\"This is what democracy looks like. This is peaceful protest,\" she said. \"The sad thing is, you'd expect the people in power to equal that.\"\n\nDemonstrations appeared to be mostly peaceful as of Saturday afternoon. In a post to X, Gov. Gavin Newsom urged protesters to keep them that way.\n\n\"As Californians take to the streets today to stand up against the President's authoritarian playbook, I urge everyone to stay safe and demonstrate peacefully,\" Newsom said. \"Don't give in to his provocations. Our strength is in our unity and peace.\"\n\nMr. Trump remained mostly quiet about the No Kings protests in the lead up, offering just a quick retort on Fox News show \"Sunday Morning Futures,\" in an interview that will air on Sunday.\n\n\"They're saying they're referring to me as a king. I'm not a king,\" he said.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters that the gatherings were a \"Hate America Rally.\"\n\n\"You're going to bring together the Marxists, the Socialists, the Antifa advocates, the anarchists and the pro-Hamas wing of the far-left Democrat Party,\" he said.",

        "description": "US Marines were set to storm the beaches of California in a 250th anniversary demonstration of the service branch's military might for Vice President JD Vance.\n\nVance is scheduled to deliver a speech to the troops on Saturday, months after the veep and President Trump marked the 250th anniversary of the Army during a military parade in Washington, DC -- complete with heavy armored vehicles.\n\nFirst, he'll see a live-fire \"amphibious assault demonstration\" at Camp Pendleton's Red Beach, according to the White House.\n\nBut the planned demonstration, set to take place near the I-5 freeway, set off its own war of words between Vance's office and California Gov. Gavin Newsom.\n\nCamp Pendleton said in a statement that \"all training events will occur on approved training ranges and comport with established safety protocols.\"\n\nThe event would include Navy and Marine operators across air, land and sea, officials said.\n\nBut Newsom, a potential 2028 presidential contender, wasn't so keen to celebrate. The Democrat called the festivities an \"absurd show of force.\"\n\n\"The President is putting his ego over responsibility with this disregard for public safety,\" Newsom whined in a statement.\n\n\"Firing live rounds over a busy highway isn't just wrong -- it's dangerous. Using our military to intimidate people you disagree with isn't strength -- it's reckless, it's disrespectful, and it's beneath the office he holds.\"\n\nVance's office shot back that there was no need to close the highway.\n\n\"Governor Newsom is spreading Fake News to Californians to fearmonger and score cheap political points,\" said spokeswoman Taylor Van Kirk.\n\n\"Vice President Vance is eager to be in California on Saturday celebrating the 250th anniversary of the Corps alongside United States Marines who, despite the Democrats' shutdown, will continue to receive pay thanks to President Trump's hard work.\"\n\nSeveral military bigwigs were set to attend, at a time when the US military has been building up forces around Venezuela and carrying out strikes on a succession of alleged drug boats. Secretary of War Pete Hegseth was also set to join, as was Navy Secretary John Phelan and Marine Commandant Eric M. Smith.\n\nVance flew to San Diego Friday night to participate. It's an anniversary of special significance for the 41-year-old vice president. He enlisted in the service after graduating high school in Ohio, serving four years in the Marines -- including a stint in Iraq.\n\nVance traveled with second lady Usha Vance, a San Diego native, and brought along their three kids on the flight to Marine Corps Air Station Miramar.\n\nHe wrote in his book \"Hillbilly Elegy\" about how \"the Marine Corps taught me how to live like an adult.\"\n\n\"In the Marines, my boss didn't just make sure I did a good job, he made sure I kept my room clean, kept my hair cut, and ironed my uniforms,\" he said, adding the Marines \"changed the expectations that I had for myself.\"",

        "description": "A plan to fire live artillery shells over a major Southern California highway as part of a military showcase attended by Vice President JD Vance has drawn strong objections from Gov. Gavin Newsom, who said safety concerns forced him to close a 17-mile (27 kilometers) portion of the interstate.\n\n\"The President is putting his ego over responsibility with this disregard for public safety,\" the Democratic governor said in a statement. \"Firing live rounds over a busy highway isn't just wrong -- it's dangerous.\"\n\nVance and U.S. Marine officials at Camp Pendleton have said there is nothing unsafe about the artillery exercise and no need to disrupt traffic on Interstate 5, which is the main highway along the Pacific coast between San Diego and Los Angeles.\n\nThe Republican vice president and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth are visiting Camp Pendleton in North San Diego County to celebrate the Marine Corps' 250th anniversary, and troops will put on a show of amphibious vehicles and aircraft with a beach landing demonstration.\n\nThe state had considered closing the freeway earlier in the week, but the U.S. Marines said Thursday that the event would occur on approved training ranges and comport with established safety protocols.\n\nState transportation officials ultimately made the decision to close the freeway after practice firings over the freeway Friday evening and a request from event organizers for signage along the road stating \"Overhead fire in progress.\"\n\nCalifornia Highway Patrol said a stretch of the highway would be closed Saturday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. local time, although travelers should expect delays before, during and after the event.\n\n\"This is all because of the White House-directed military event, that for the safety of the public, we need to shut down the freeway since they're sending live ordinances over the freeway,\" California Department of Transportation spokesperson Matt Rocco said.\n\nThe Associated Press has reached out to Vance's office and the U.S. Marines for comment.\n\nIn a statement to The New York Times, a spokesperson for Vance, William Martin, said Newsom is misleading the public about the safety risk. He said it was routine training.\n\n\"If Gavin Newsom wants to oppose the training exercises that ensure our Armed Forces are the deadliest and most lethal fighting force in the world, then he can go right ahead,\" Martin said.\n\nRocco said the I-5 closure could cost up to another two hours of trip time for those commuting between San Diego and Los Angeles. The freeway carries with 80,000 travelers and $94 million in freight through the corridor daily, according to the governor's office. Passenger rail services running parallel to the I-5 have also been canceled for the afternoon.",

        "title": "California lawsuit says makers of plastic bags lied about products being recyclable",
        "description": "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- California ramped up its efforts to curb plastic pollution Friday - suing three plastic-bag makers, alleging the companies falsely claimed their products were recyclable.\n\nState Attorney General Rob Bonta, a Democrat, said companies Novolex Holdings, Inteplast Group and Mettler Packaging violated a state law passed in 2014 that banned plastic bags at grocery store checkouts that weren't recyclable.\n\nUnder the law, shoppers could pay 10 cents for thicker plastic bags that needed to be reusable and recyclable. But the makers of the bags labeled them as recyclable even though they were not - recycling facilities cannot process them and they end up dumped in landfills, incinerated, or in the state's waterways, Bonta said.\n\n\"In California, we're making it clear,\" he said at a news conference. \"Truth matters. Public trust matters. Environmental protection matters.\"\n\nThe companies did not respond to email and phone requests for comment.\n\nThe state filed a similar lawsuit against ExxonMobil about a year ago over the oil giant's plastic products. The lawsuit said the company deceived the public by falsely promising that its plastic products would be recycled. The oil giant said California's recycling system was ineffective and that the state should have worked with the company to keep plastics out of landfills.\n\nCalifornia lawmakers later decided the 2014 law didn't go far enough. Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a law last year that will ban all plastic shopping bags at grocery stores starting next year.\n\nAt least a dozen states have some type of statewide plastic bag ban, according to the environmental advocacy group Environment America Research and Policy Center. Hundreds of cities also have their own bans.\n\nBonta announced Friday the state reached settlements with four other companies California alleged violated the 2014 law: Revolution Sustainable Solutions, Metro Poly, PreZero US Packaging and Advance Polybag. The businesses agreed to collectively pay the state nearly $1.8 million and halt plastic bag sales in California after selling the rest of their existing stock.\n\nThe lawsuit and settlements hold companies accountable for mislabeling their products as recyclable, said Nick Lapis, director of advocacy for environmental group Californians Against Waste.\n\n\"Plastic bags are a uniquely wasteful product,\" he said in an email. \"Nothing we use for minutes should pollute our environment for centuries, especially something so lightweight that it's practically designed to become litter.\"",

        "title": "In AP interview, Harris says Democrats 'are standing up for working people' in government shutdown",
        "description": "BIRMINGHAM, Ala. -- As Democrats dig in for a lengthening government shutdown, former Vice President Kamala Harris is cheering them on as she travels the country touting her presidential campaign memoir amid speculation about another White House run.\n\nThe Democratic 2024 nominee told The Associated Press in an interview Friday that she remains in contact with Democrats on Capitol Hill, encouraging them to maintain their demands that President Donald Trump and the Republican congressional majority address looming spikes in Affordable Care Act health insurance premiums.\n\n\"The Republicans control the House. They control the Senate. They control the White House. They are in charge, and they are responsible for the shutdown,\" she said.\n\nDemocrats, she said, \"are doing the right thing by standing up for working people and not allowing the Republicans to carry a tax cut for the wealthiest people in our country on the backs of working people in America.\"\n\nIt was just one example of Harris using her book tour to urge Democrats to lead a consistent, aggressive resistance to Trump while at the same time recommitting to reaching working- and middle-class voters who supported the Republican or stayed home last November.\n\nOver the course of the day, Harris sat down for an hourlong conversation with five Black college students, spoke to the AP and held two book discussions in Alabama's largest city. Paid ticketholders filled downtown Birmingham's Alabama Theatre, where Harris discussed her campaign, the Democratic Party and the course of the nation with radio host Charlamagne tha God.\n\nPHOTOS: In AP interview, Harris says Democrats 'are standing up for working people' in government shutdown\n\nThrough it all, Harris projected the aura of party elder and future candidate. She expressed concern for the country's direction and outright incredulity over many of Trump's actions. When VIP ticketholders told her in a photo line how disappointed they had been by her loss, she played it forward.\n\n\"We've got work to do,\" she said repeatedly. \"Keep fighting.\"\n\nOn stage and to the AP, she praised her party's \"deep and wide bench\" and even called for lowering the nation's voting age to 16 to bring more young people into the political process.\n\nHarris, 60, maintained she has made no decision about her own political future. But she made clear that running again in 2028 is still on the table and that she sees herself as a player in the party and a voice in the national discourse.\n\n\"I am a leader of the party,\" she told the AP. \"I take seriously that responsibility and duty that I feel\" as the previous nominee. That \"includes traveling the country talking and mostly listening with folks,\" she said, and \"getting folks ready to fight in the midterms\" in 2026.\n\nHarris aides confirmed she will help Democratic gubernatorial candidates Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey and Abigail Spanberger in Virginia with virtual events, fundraising appeals and robocalls. She also recently headlined a fundraiser for North Carolina Senate candidate Roy Cooper, a former governor and Harris' longtime friend.\n\nLater this month, she plans to campaign for California's \"Yes on Prop 50,\" the ballot measure that would allow a Democratic-led redraw of the state's congressional districts to counter Republican gerrymandering in Texas and other Republican-controlled states.\n\nHarris, who was unusually blunt in her book \"107 Days\" about her opinions on a range of political figures, was more circumspect Friday when asked to assess other leading Democrats.\n\n\"We have to get away from this idea of 'Who is the one?' There are many ways that I think will be effective when people are authentic unto themselves,\" she said when asked about her fellow Californian, Gov. Gavin Newsom, and his recent social media mockery of Trump.\n\nShe named U.S. Reps. Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas, and Brittany Petterson, D-Colo., but did not elaborate. \"Every voice and every perspective\" can resonate with certain voters, she said.\n\nHarris rejected conventional political wisdom that she lost in part because of Republicans' sustained attacks on cultural and social issues, especially transgender issues. She said economics, notably inflation, was the bigger factor.\n\n\"There are a fair number of people who voted for Donald Trump because they believed what he said, which is that he was going to bring down prices,\" she told the AP. \"Sadly, he lied to them.\"\n\nWith prices still high and wealth gaps growing, Harris said, \"We've got to do a better job of dealing with the immediate needs of the American people.\"\n\nShe praised the Biden administration's legislative accomplishments but said household-level policies such as child tax credits, family leave and first-time homebuyer credits should have come before a sweeping infrastructure program and the CHIPS semiconductor manufacturing law.\n\nEven with a sharper economic message, Harris acknowledged structural challenges for Democrats: the proliferation of false information and what she described as conservatives' assault on democracy.\n\nShe rejected the idea of \"low-information voters,\" saying the problem is actually an abundance of misinformation and disinformation that makes it harder to reach many voters. She said Democrats must penetrate those silos rather than presume anyone is a lost cause.\n\n\"They deserve to be heard,\" she said.\n\nOnstage, Harris described a \"reversal\" of the Civil Rights Movement. She lamented that the Supreme Court could eliminate Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which protects political district boundaries drawn to ensure minority communities can elect candidates of their choice.\n\nWithout that law, nonwhite representation -- especially Black representation in the South -- could diminish considerably, from Congress to local school boards and municipal councils.\n\n\"How can we say at this moment in time that the Voting Rights Act and Section 2 has no purpose?\" Harris said to the AP.\n\nThe issue carried special resonance given the venue. The Voting Rights Act passed in 1965 after Martin Luther King Jr. and civil rights leaders marched from Selma, Alabama, to Montgomery. A later Supreme Court case out of Mobile led Congress to clarify its intent with Section 2 of the law. And it was a Shelby County, Alabama, case that the Supreme Court used in 2013 to gut the law's requirement that the U.S. Justice Department approve election procedures in local jurisdictions with a demonstrated history of discrimination.\n\nBesides the pending Supreme Court case, Harris said she has followed Trump's rhetoric on immigrants, along with statements from top Trump adviser Stephen Miller and other Republicans suggesting the U.S. owes its identity to white European settlers.\n\n\"Just looking at it in terms of their words, they're race baiting, they're scapegoating,\" she said. But she stopped short of saying the administration is being driven by a white nationalist ideology: \"I can't pretend to know what is in their head.\"\n\nHarris said Friday that she never doubted former President Joe Biden's ability to serve, even when he ended his reelection bid because of concerns about his age. That's different, she explained, than discussions about whether the 82-year-old could have served another term.\n\n\"He and I have been playing phone tag actually in the last couple of days,\" Harris told the AP when asked whether she still talks to Biden, who is undergoing prostate cancer treatment. \"I'd invite everyone to say a prayer if that's what you do for his well-being and health right now.\"",

        "description": "Newsom's office first received reports earlier this week that Marines at Camp Pendleton near San Diego were planning to fire artillery shells Saturday in a training exercise, and as part of a celebration of the Marine Corps' 250th birthday, as reported by The Los Angeles Times on Wednesday. At the time, Newsom said the unconfirmed reports, if true, were not \"the right way to go about\" honoring the Marines' anniversary.\n\nThe New York Times confirmed the reports to be accurate on Saturday, and in a statement to the outlet, Newsom condemned the plan as a \"profoundly absurd show of force that could put Californians directly in harm's way.\"\n\n\"Using our military to intimidate people you disagree with isn't strength - it's reckless, it's disrespectful, and it's beneath the office the president holds,\" Newsom told the Times.\n\nWilliam Martin, Vance's communications director, however, fired back at Newsom over his concerns, and invited the California governor to try and oppose the military exercise.\n\n\"Gavin Newsom wants people to think this exercise is dangerous; the Marine Corps says it's an established and safe practice,\" Martin said in a statement as reported by the Times Saturday.\n\n\"Newsom wants people to think this is an absurd show of force. The Marine Corps says it's part of routine training at Camp Pendleton. If Gavin Newsom wants to oppose the training exercises that ensure our Armed Forces are the deadliest and most lethal fighting force in the world, then he can go right ahead.\"The announcement has already led to a temporary suspension of airspace around Camp Pendleton, the Times reported, along with the passenger rail Amtrak",

        "title": "Video: Opinion | How Southern Politics Shaped Trumpism",
        "description": "Three Southern Opinion columnists on the region and its outsize role in national politics.\n\nIt's Interesting to me right now watching which Southerners are teeing themselves up to be the country fried steak version of Gavin Newsom, so I'm watching that play out. Country fried steak. Gavin Newsom, I like it. Yeah, that's pretty much what it's going to take. Because it's just us Southerners today. I thought we could Zoom out a bit and talk about the South. I'm going to tell you y'all a story that is I'll say it this way. It's the first moment when I knew that never Trump was absolutely cooked. And that was early in 2016. There had been some glimmers of hope that Donald Trump could be stopped after the Iowa caucuses. Remember, he underperformed there. And then he comes to the South. And I can remember watching him. Here's a New Yorker, a New York real estate developer, reality TV star should not, on paper, be somebody who's going to really connect with the American South. But then I looked at him and I watched him operate and I thought oh, we're done. He's sweeping, sweeping Super Tuesday. Why? Because he was a very familiar figure. If you are somebody who's paid attention to Southern culture and politics, he immediately fit into that mold of a Huey Long, of a George Wallace of a Edwin Edwards from Louisiana. And I thought, this person is absolutely connecting at a very fundamental level with his audience, and he's kept connecting. We're all, as I said, we're all Southerners here. Let's talk about this. But before we dive into the substance of it all, let's establish our Southern street cred, so to speak. I was born in Opelika, Alabama, raised in Alabama, Louisiana, Tennessee and Kentucky. I'm coming to you from Nashville right now. Tressie, what's your Southern background? I could start by saying, well, I'm Black, but I guess that doesn't totally cover it all, so I'll be more specific. Let's see. My family is from Eastern North Carolina, Robeson County. This may be one of the rare occasions where Robeson gets a shout out in the New York Times' I'm going to say that very strongly. Robeson County is Eastern North Carolina. And we have been there for generations. I like you, David, have lived all across this country but have consistently returned to the American South. And I presently live and work in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, which is in the midst of a football induced crisis, which at this very moment, if we want to pivot, I am happy to talk about the football induced crisis here. And in fact, if you give me enough time and a long enough ramp, I can make it the story of the nation. If you allow me. Bill Belichick coming from New England to Chapel Hill, North Carolina, to save us from ourselves at the behest of the state's Republican cultural elite. If you give me time, David, I can make it work. But, yes. Oh, I didn't mean to open that can of worms, but I. Believe me, I would love to hear every second of it. But, Jamelle, what about my friend. We're going through some difficult things right now. I have not lived as much around the South as either of y'all. My family is from. My mom grew up in Waycross, Georgia, which is in Ware County, Georgia, in the Southern part of the state. My dad grew up in Quincy, Florida, which is Gadsden County, and then also Fort Myers, kind of back and forth between those two places. But I grew up in Virginia Beach, Virginia, and then went to the University of Virginia and then lived in D.C. for a minute. And now I'm in Charlottesville, Virginia. I think of myself as a southerner. Yes, but also very much like a Virginian, right. Oh shots fired. Jamelle drawing the distinctions. I'm not drawing a distinction, but I do think that I do think that for people within the South, there's people recognize the real cultural distinctions between places. I think what matters here is that we have all so far. Yeah I think what matters here is at this point, we have all said y'all appropriately. That's true. And that is everybody's credibility. So let's get into the substance here. Tressie in 2023, you wrote a column called \"Why I Keep My Eyes and Mind on the South.\" And it's all about how you can understand where American politics are headed based on what you see in the South. Why do you say that? Well, said one, I mean, I believe it deeply and truly. And at the time that I was writing that, of course, in 2023 there was some nascent hope that we were turning a page on, I think, Southern politics and its hold on national politics. We thought we had a strategy, even for Trumpism. We had survived it once. We can survive it again. And one of the things that I was trying to remind people, something that I think Jamal does particularly well here, is that, in fact, what we needed to be concerned about is that Trump had realized how much power he could derive by deeply embedding himself in the ideas of the South, the iconography of the American South. And, unfortunately, I think that is one of the things that we have learned to be true. But I think one of the things that when we say Trumpism, I'm talking about both Donald Trump and the infrastructure around him that makes him powerful and to a certain extent, effective. I think one of the things they learned is that the most efficient way to control the public's attention was to just hammer these ideas that I think are deeply, fundamentally Southern. So these are ideas about race, obviously, and these are ideas about the inherent character of the nation, about who is included and who is excluded, not just constitutionally, but whose citizenship is always conditional. These are all deeply and fundamentally Southern relationships of power. But I also would like to point out the reason why those ideas are so rich and so powerful in the South isn't just because the South is uniquely racist. It is because that's where the nation's shunts off all of those conversations. And so we tend to hold all of that energy, all those ideas, all of those histories for the rest of the country. And I think that what Donald Trump has figured out is something that national politicians have long figured out in this country is that well, never runs dry. And I thought one of the mistakes we made the first time and by we I will include myself here, although I would like to say I did not make the mistake nearly as bad as some of my professional peers did, or consistently wasn't, thinking that somehow we had moved beyond that. And that you could understand the broader political map and imaginary by looking at it from the vantage point of New York or California or the Midwest. And I just thought that one of the reasons why we missed why a message of economic populism message packaged in Trump's infotainment package, why that would work in the South. As you talk about seeing him live. I also saw him live in Richmond, Virginia. I saw him in South Carolina. I saw him outside of Atlanta, Georgia. It was never a surprise to me that he spoke to Southerners. I was surprised by how many of US professional observers weren't paying attention to how well he worked here, because I thought that was a message for how well he was going to work across the country. Yeah I want to add a note to Tressie's last point there. So one observation I'm sure everyone on in this conversation has made and other people have made is the way that there has emerged kind of almost generic national, rural culture. It's a certain kind of country music. It's a certain kind of pickup truck. You see it if you go to rural New Hampshire, if you go to rural Montana, if you go to rural Illinois, you'll see it. And it's very much rooted in a franchised version of a white Southern rural reality. And I bring that up to say that it's both the case that the country will shunt its difficult conversations, as Tressie said, about say, race to the South and make it a Southern problem. But it's always been the case that the rest of the country, has been fascinated by the South in really important ways the people who push the narratives of national reconciliation in the decades after reconstruction weren't Southerners right. It was a bunch of New Jersey academics at Princeton. Woodrow Wilson, although born in Virginia, very much a man of the mid-Atlantic, you might say. Hollywood's fascination with the South, you cannot understand. I mean, there's obviously the birth of a nation, but you can't understand the history of American film without a recognition of a real fascination with the imagery and the culture of at least a particular version of the South that pulses through westerns, that pulses through screwball comedies, TV. I mean, we all get a little Southern when this nation is going fascist is just what it is, right. We all want to consume the romantic version of the South the verandas, the Magnolia trees, the music the food to Jamelle's point. When I look out across like our popular culture even I'm always going to start paying attention when country music is ascendant. I'm always going to pay attention. When SEC football now becomes a national obsession. I'm going to pay attention when the Bama Rush girls are driving millions of dollars of free marketing for their university. Because what that does for people, again, audience that is consuming this from outside the South is we can always say, no matter how bad it is in California, no matter how bad it is in Montana, at least we're not the South. And so you consume the palatable parts of the South to make yourself feel better about where the National trend lines of politics are going. But yet we produce an idea of America that says, well, we're not as bad as the South, but also the South wasn't really always that bad, now was it. We're always doing both of those projects at the same time in the context of Donald Trump, I think it actually -- Donald Trump's usage of the South for example, his occasional references like oh, they took down the statues and that kind of thing. I mean, Donald Trump's the extent to which he connects or connected with Southern voters in 2016 and the extent to which the Southern evangelicals, become kind of his core constituency to me, reflects both things happening internal, but also this national interest in fascination with the American South. The other thing I'll say, just in terms of Trump as a familiar and recognizable figure. So, you mentioned David Huey Long, Edwin Edwards, part of Trump's political appeal. And this isn't I feel like this isn't talked about enough, is that he presents himself as this perfect avatar of a kind of patriarchal masculinity. He has all this money and he has this gilded home, and he has this big family, right. Even in even elements of him that the joke, if Obama had done that, people would gone crazy and they would have, such as his multiple wives. And, basically multiple babies mamas is in this image of patriarchal white masculinity, Southern masculinity, not an issue. That particular image of masculinity is so deeply rooted in Southern culture, going back to the very beginning. And Trump just slots right into it, no problem whatsoever. There is a time in my life when hearing you, you all talk about the South like this. I would have bristled a bit. I would have said, O.K, I'm going to fully acknowledge there are radiating still negative effects of the South's past in the South, no question, but it really has turned a page in a very decisive way. But I think for me, one of the things that has been very dispiriting about the present moment is that I don't think the South has changed as much as I thought it had changed that a lot of the elements that I thought of what we call New South, what we called the New South. I'm sure you guys remember Atlanta being called the city. Too busy to hate that. It was turning the page on racism in the past through commerce, through hatred was bad for business. And so the South was moving on. It was a commercial place. It was a place that was growing economically, growing in population. It wasn't a backwater anymore. And I grew up in that period after the Civil rights movement came of age politically, after Richard Nixon is gone and this kind of blip of a moment where the Republican Party, which was rooted in the South, very much started to identify itself around the concept of personal character in response to Bill Clinton. And to me, that was the New South, that it had left segregation behind. It had left hatred behind. It was still struggling with the legacy of all of that, but it had largely left it behind. It had left all of that populist nonsense behind. And then here comes Donald Trump and makes me rethink almost all of that. And it was as if the new right, what we call the new right now, really is truly the old right. It really is an older right than what you saw, say, in Reagan. In Reagan, republicanism and its center of revival is in the South. And what I'm curious, and either Jamelle or Tressie, this really interesting fusion, though, if you look back on it with the intense religious fervor of the South at the same time that it has this legacy of extremely corrupt political figures and this symbiotic relationship that they had that seems to have persisted into this present era, but channeled and funneled into the person of Donald Trump. Is that too much to say. Our perspective on where we are in history is just always shaped by where we enter it. And so we can have an overinflated, overinflated sense of clarity about Oh, this is the direction that we're going in. And I think things are far more cyclical than we are usually willing to admit. And one of the things that some people have struggled with in Donald Trump is the fact that he is both a departure from the way that politics were operating in the moment, but is not a departure historically. Again, when you talk about the commerce angle and how much we relied on economic nationalism to save the cultural, moral and ethical failings of the American South, that supposes that economic progress is at odds with racial regression. And what I would argue is that those things have always not just been compatible, but have been symbiotic. Symbiotic I mean, slavery is an economic system. So these two things are not at odds. It is just that in the South, they are always hyper visible in a way that other regional economies in this country cannot say. You listen, God bless Atlanta. Atlanta raised me culturally, right. I owe 30 percent of my personality to Outkast. I grew up wanting to be one of the new Black Americans in the Black elite, coming out after the Cosby Show and living my great dreams in Atlanta every good black person in the 1990s. But the idea that there was ever any truth to the idea that we were too busy building a commercial economic powerhouse for Black America for us to be bothered with, racism really flies in the face of what was happening on the ground during that time of so-called economic progress. You can look at something like, Bill Clinton's America. This is also the creation of a police surveillance system that fundamentally pins Black Americans into everything from substandard housing to being geographically isolated out of the economic progress of Atlanta. The cost of living starts to push black people out of its inner core, for example. So these things are all happening simultaneously. This is about the difference between the reality of our political life and the story we tell ourselves about our political life. And I think what Donald Trump, Trump and the G.O.P., which I now want to make, I always want to take the opportunity to say these are now 1 and the same. But what they have been able to exploit is like our constant forgetting about that, and how much we want to believe that economic progress will take care of these things. And I would just I always hearken back to somebody like a Du Bois who says these things are not antithetical to each other, economic progress and racism are deeply intertwined. Yeah in addition to the cultural and political piece, I would identify just the economic agenda of this G.O.P. as a kind of national vision of what the South has been, which is a region of extraction, weak or no rights for labor, right of surveillance, of control, of low wages, of low services, and of not just low taxes for those that already have wealth and privilege, but essentially they're kind of right to dominate the entire economic and political sphere unmolested by those they perceive to be below them. That to me, that is Trumpism, right. That is Trumpism. And I think it really I think it's important to recognize the way that this is not just a cultural thing that's happening, that what we're looking at is the influence of an economic model that has appeal to political elites across the country, as it always has, always has. The first offshoring wasn't to Mexico, wasn't to Vietnam, it was to Alabama. It was to Georgia. It still is. That's the car factories are in Tennessee because the labor protections aren't in. The Southern politicians go out to the rest of the world and say, and they say to them, our labor is easier to control than the labor is in California. Our labor pool is difficult to unionize in the American South. And this is the deal we make you. So every time a Southern politician goes out and they congratulate themselves about building the new car factory or the new battery maker in some rural part of their Southern. You state or municipality. What they have generally done is they have made a deal with either a national or a transnational conglomerate that says do not have to worry about unionizing. That is the deal, but it is a continuation of the same idea. Well, I do think it is interesting you brought up the economic piece of this. I come from a town. When I was there, it was when I was growing up, there was about 8,000 people. We had three stoplights in Kentucky, a rural town in Kentucky. That's where I spent my elementary and high school years. And it's unrecognizable now because a Toyota manufacturing plant came there and completely transformed the city. But these are good, high paying jobs. They are transformative jobs in these parts of the South. But it is absolutely true that they also pull and draw jobs from other parts of America. And it's one of the reasons why I think so many people have been moving to the South, which is let me erase that. One of the interesting elements to me about the current national moment is that it's not just that the politics of the South are so dominant in many ways. As I mentioned earlier, the culture and economics of the South are growing more dominant as well. And you've had a huge in-migration from other parts of the country coming into the South, into the Sun Belt, Texas growing in population, Florida growing in population. Tennessee at Nashville, where I am, has been exploding in population. Why What are you seeing are the reasons for that. What are the reasons for why the South. Aside from climate, which is better than other parts of the country, but some days can feel a little too hot for a little too long. Why is that. Why is it functioning as such a magnet right now in American migration. Jamelle, I'll start with you. That's an interesting question. I think it's a couple of things. It is economic development. And I want to quickly just say like I'm not opposed to the construction of factories down South. I'm opposed to the exploitation of labor. So if you can have if you can have good, well-paying jobs with people who have meaningful economic freedom and important say and can collectively bargain, that's great. It's when that it's when the deal is you get this job and also you shut up and you like it. And if we decide that we're going to take this job away, or we're going to subject you to worse conditions, you just have to accept it, because it could be worse. There could be nothing. That's what I object to. But as far as migration, it's certainly economic growth. It's housing. Part of what's happening is in on the West Coast and in the Northeast, basically the housing markets are calcified. There's very little new building. And so if you want to own a home, which is still a dream for many Americans, you go to where the homes are and the homes are in Greenfield development throughout the South. Yeah, Jamelle points out something really elegant, which is that one of the things that has happened with our internal migration is that plenty of solidly middle class, upper middle, upper middle class, upwardly mobile white Americans are feeling, I think, at just a basic demographic level, a push and a pull that they have not had to participate in or haven't felt in quite some time. I mean, we're looking at a push and pull that is very close to the urbanization of the United States at one point in time. And so people are feeling, I think, a push out of some places. As Jamelle points out, the high cost of housing, the high cost of transportation. And then I would also say just the friction of trying to support like a family life in some of those places, how difficult that then becomes the high cost of child care being one that I think about a great deal. And then I think the things pulling people are that our culture has been nationalized to a certain point, that once you learn how to accept grits and say, y'all, you'll fit in and you'll do fine. And so there's less friction there about migrating and moving across region than I think there used to be. And then I want to put a finer point on this thing about economic development and across to Southern economy that you alluded to there, David, which is yeah, you can build a new plant that creates all of these good paying jobs. But the story over and over again has been, especially in the South, that doesn't necessarily improve mobility and the quality of life for people native to the area. So the opportunity structure that I tend to be interested in the South is O.K. Well, build me a wind farm that then transforms the mobility of the people who have been here intergenerationally who are of trapped to that sticky floor of the bottom of the economic ladder in the South. And what we're seeing here is not just a transplant of people, but of ideas that don't necessarily create that kind of mobility for Southern workers across the South, which then leads to a war, a battle for the soul of rural America that you can feel very tangibly in the South. That is just about I think these yeah, these demographic push and pulls that are moving people around the country in these ways that concern people about their political hold on their homes. Yeah well, you both have mentioned housing and cost of living. And in my experience, I've talked to a lot of transplants who've come to Tennessee a lot. And what they will say time and time again. Is that the exact thing that you said about housing and expenses, that they feel as if they just couldn't afford. The American dream in California, they couldn't afford it in New York, but they absolutely can afford it in Nashville, or at least could until Nashville became almost as expensive as some of these cities. But is there anything that the Democratic Party can learn from this. If you've got entire regions of the country that are pulling citizens at scale from core blue areas into these red areas, what can Democrats learn from a matter of policy. I want to make two points about this. And it's going to reflect, I think, what Democrats can do. But the limits of that, what Democrats can do, obviously, is in places where they have unified control, they can make it easier to build housing. I mean, there, I think Democratic led states should try to stem the bleeding, right. Like make it easier to construct housing for the people who want to stay, who like where they are. As Tressie said, it is quite difficult to get people to move, and some people are moving because they feel they don't really have any choice. But I also want to say that part of the allure of the South as a cultural object, and this is getting back to what Tressie said earlier about cost of living is not simply that things might be cheaper, but that you have an opportunity to use your wealth, for lack of a better term to dominate other people. You can have a big compound in the middle of Texas and drive a gigantic vehicle and use all the resources you like and boss people around. And that is it's the Yellowstone-ification sonification of the country. Jamelle yes, yes. And that aspect of it cannot. You can't. There's nothing there's no policy you can do to compete with that, I guess, because what a place that California is offering the trade off is it's going to be more expensive to live here. You won't be able to unless you are in the highest echelon of income earners. You're not going to be able to hire someone to look after your house for dirt cheap, right. You won't be able to exploit someone so easily, but you are going to live in this multicultural. Yeah cosmopolitan place where people are going to exist at least like culturally, at least on some plane of equality. And if you like that. If you like that kind of life and experience, that's what you're here in L.A. for. That's what you're here in New York for. That's what you here in Chicago for. And all the places that are kind of their own places, but offer a smaller or more manageable version of that thing. People are going to want to choose that. And are going to make the sacrifices necessary to choose that. And then the people who want to be able to live the Yellowstone life are going to choose that which also comes with their own set of sacrifices. And so there is I would say there really is a competing, competing visions of what the good life is in the United States and parts of the South, or in the cultural imagination of the nation. The South offers one particular vision. And there are things, perhaps, that blue states within the South as well. There are things you can do to say, well if you're leaving, because specifically because the cost of housing is so high, we can do something about that. But the cultural thing is the cultural thing, and that's a struggle. That's not going to happen in the realm of politics such that it is a struggle and not just simply like a thing. That is the case about this country that we share. Yeah, I think about I'm not comfortable with telling the Democratic Party what they need to do. I'm much more comfortable saying, I can tell you what I think people are saying they need done for them. And whoever steps into the void to do that, that's politics. Come and give us your vision. And I think one of the things that happened with the Democratic Party in the South, and I'm just going to say this plainly, as someone who's seen it. The Democratic Party's just has to reckon with the fact that if it wants to matter politically, it has to negotiate with black political power. And if it wants to be viable and competitive with the Republican Party, that is figuring out a message of economic populism that cuts across some race differences. It had better figure out how to invest in and grow the Black political infrastructure. One of the challenges, I think, that the Democratic Party is facing in this moment is that just like everyday life of Black political life in the South has changed. So you see this decline of what we like call chocolate cities. A place like Atlanta or D.C., seeing these massive demographic changes, which does weaken the Black political structure of the South, which the DNC needs. And then you whichever party is going to respond to the economic pain of America is going to have to respond to how complicated it is to get the right economic message when So much of that is embedded in racism. And just because it is hard doesn't mean you get to write off the American South, because it's just too hard to come up with an economic message when you have to also deal with deep racial divisions. My argument has been, if you cannot sell your economic message in the South, you are not going to be able to win, right. You do not deserve a national economic message. If that economic message makes no sense. It's incoherent when you bring it to South Carolina or when you bring it to Georgia, or when you bring it to rural parts of the American South. And they have not figured that out. Now, the Republican Party hasn't figured that out either. But what they have figured out is that if you play to the National impulse of grievance strongly enough, deeply enough, you can get people to buy into national politics because there is no local politics happening around them that they can see. There's no local politics that is serving them. Now, is this is unfair. This is an asymmetry in our political system that the Democratic Party needs that message more than Republicans do. But life is not fair, little girl. As my mother liked to tell me. Politics are not fair, little girl. You still have to go out there and shape a message for them. And if you don't do that, then the National message of grievance will win out every time. In my experience, it's almost as if outside of the local power centers within the South, the Democratic Party even is taking seriously the idea of competing. Yeah, one of the things that is puzzling to me is why does with a few exceptions, the Southern Democratic Party consistently bring candidates to the polls who are every bit, for example, as socially liberal as you have, say, a Democratic candidate in the West Coast or the East Coast. How about a more aggressive outreach to more socially moderate and socially conservative voters in the South. And it seems as if that's that very idea is sometimes an anathema. I mean, yeah, I think the exact opposite is true. I think the exact opposite is true, that what we see, certainly in my part of the South, I talked to local politicians all the time who would love the support of the Democratic Party, is that they have a message to local constituents on the ground who absolutely want oh, I don't tenant owned cooperative housing, who absolutely want to increase their local minimum wage or they want a living wage. These are things that at a more like nationalized level, sound socially liberal and out of step with our idea of Southern voters, but that Southern voters want they will have a candidate who wants to deliver on that for them locally. But because that message doesn't fit the Democrats national message that they find they don't get a lot of the state party support for those candidates. And I actually think that across the South, especially with poor and working class Southerners, strong economic messages that may sound deeply radical on the national stage can play fairly well at home if they trust the political party. Now, there's a whole lot, and there's a whole lot to be said there that race and education come into play. But if they trust their local political party can be far more radical now. I think at the state level, again, especially in places like North Carolina, we tend to prefer a more socially conservative performance of Southern politics at our state level. But on the ground, especially when you're talking about local elections, it is that the Democratic Party wants to run a far more conservative candidate than can excite the base across rural, the rural parts of the South. I want to also add to this point about trust, which isn't just about what's happening in Southern politics, but national politics. I often think that the desire for candidates, to say, why don't Democrats just want to run. Someone who holds more conservative social views is an attempt to do a shortcut to the trust question that the equation being offered is if you hold x, z moderate to conservative social position, this will buy you the trust you need with the critical voters. You need to win to be able to win an election. But I just don't think that works. I think we've seen quite clearly that it just doesn't work, that the distrust that the trust deficit is so deep that there's no messaging along those lines that's necessarily going to bridge that gap. And so the question is, well, how do you fix the trust deficit. And that is kind of rebuilding I think the Democratic Party not as basically like a glorified messaging organ, but as an actually present local organization that is engaged in the kind of work that local organizations are engaged in. You can build trust, the force of personality. But for parties to build trust, they have to build trust through, I think, actually delivering things to the people they hope to serve in delivering can happen at the level of the state. It could also happen at the level of para state organizations. And that's what I would say. I think, for example, I think that it would be a good idea for the Democratic Party to make serious investments in Mississippi, a state where Democratic candidates with no investment, routinely hit the mid 40s in statewide elections. That's a clear sign. Like it's going to be really hard to close that gap because of racial polarization in the state. But the gap can be closed, and making Mississippi competitive would be a huge blow to Republicans. Changes the game, changes the map. It changes the game. It does. Yeah what does that look like. Well, what that looks like is redefining what the Democratic Party is. Mississippi, a state where there is such low state investment, will use the Democratic Party as just a private organization, as a venue for public investment. Local Democratic parties are creating public spaces for people to gather. Local Democratic parties are providing basic services fixing your taillight offering tutors for your kids, that kind of thing, and building trust. So that when election time does come around, it isn't vote for us because you have some cultural affinity for us. It's vote for us because we've done something for you, and we'll do something for you if you put us into office. All right. On that note, let's move on to our recommendations. So, Tressie as the guest of honor, you're first. Oh, I am. My stuff lately has not been a whole lot of fun. My reading. I just finished rereading my first time in a while, reading \"Deacons of Defense.\" So if anybody wants to talk about armed resistance across the American South, I'm primed for that. But I guess that's not lighter. Yeah, I just finished rereading. I hadn't read that since undergrad and found it especially powerful. Reading it today. Jamelle? I have been on a Duke Ellington kick for some time. I went through this thing where I was like, I've never. Obviously, I know who Duke Ellington is, but never really listened to Duke Ellington in a serious way. So just wanting to sit down and seriously listen to Duke Ellington. And I had this experience of being like, yeah, this guy, this guy rules. As it turns out. Yeah Yeah. As it turns out, this guy is. This guy's great. So I want to recommend his 1943 piece for his first concert at Carnegie Hall. That's called \"Black, Brown and Beige.\" And it was Ellington's attempt to tell the story of Black America in jazz. And it kind of composed jazz symphony. There is a version of it that he recorded in 1958 with Mahalia Jackson. That is absolutely wonderful. And you can find that for streaming on Apple or Spotify or whatever, but I highly recommend it. And just like to really don't like, listen to it while you're doing things like just listen to it and sit with it and actually try to experience it because it is just you'll listen to it and you'll be like yeah, Duke Ellington is one of the great composers of all time. Like, not just great American composers, but one of the singularly great composers that has ever lived. Well, mine is grim. Mine is a movie called \"A House of Dynamite.\" It's a Kathryn Bigelow film. And it's. The premise is it's just a normal day at the office in the American National defense establishment until a ballistic missile launch is detected, and then everything changes all at once in the most tense ways imaginable. So Kathryn Bigelow's very adept at directing tense thriller type movies. Very tense, very sobering, very good movie. So with that, we'll wrap it up. Tressie, Jamelle, thanks so much for chatting. Oh, it's always a pleasure. Yeah, it's a real pleasure to see you all, even if it is virtually.",

Arnold Schwarzenegger revealed on \"Real Time\" Friday whether he is still a Republican.\n\nHe responded to host Bill Maher, who challenged if what made the Austrian-born bodybuilder want to be a Republican \"still applies\" to the party today.\n\n\"You think that's still the party? You think that still applies to the Republican Party, what made you want to be a Republican, where they are today?\" Maher asked.\n\nThe \"Terminator\" actor, who served as California's last Republican governor from 2003-2011, argued the Republican Party has \"changed\" before answering Maher's question.\n\nBILL MAHER SAYS TO BRING BACK 'OLD AMERICA,' THE LEFT MUST TONE DOWN THEIR RADICAL PROGRESSIVISM\n\n\"Bill, things change,\" Schwarzenegger replied. \"It's very clear that it has changed. I'm a traditional Republican.\"\n\nThe former politician went on to tout the accomplishments of \"great Republicans,\" including former Presidents Abraham Lincoln, Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan.\n\n\"I'm the kind of a Republican - like Lincoln, who made sure that slavery stops,\" Schwarzenegger said. \"He made sure that the Blacks got the right to vote. He made sure, the Republican Party then, made sure that the Blacks became citizens of the United States...all of those kinds of things - Republicans did that.\"\n\n\"The party has changed now...but that doesn't mean that we have to change,\" he continued. \"We have to fight to get the party back and to get the philosophy back.\"\n\nSCHWARZENEGGER TAUNTS NEWSOM WITH MESSAGE TARGETING DEM REDISTRICTING PUSH\n\nMaher recalled when Schwarzenegger opened up about his personal experience with socialism, citing his \"moving\" speech at the RNC in 2004.\n\n\"You talked about growing up at a time when Vienna was actually occupied,\" Maher recounted.\n\n\"That's right, Austria was still occupied by the Russians,\" Schwarzenegger said.\n\nSchwarzenegger \"didn't know\" what American political parties were before entering the country, the late-night host noted.\n\n\"So you saw socialism firsthand,\" Maher said. \"You had heard the Democrats speak and you heard I think Nixon talk, and you heard the ideas of the Republican Party.

        "title": "Placer County town of Loomis considers entertainment zone for downtown",
        "description": "A new proposal is creating buzz in the Northern California town of Loomis, as city leaders consider bringing an Entertainment Zone to the heart of the community.\n\nThe proposal, which would stretch from 3565 Taylor Road to 3790 Taylor Road, could transform the way people experience downtown, allowing visitors to legally enjoy alcohol outdoors.\n\nThe concept comes from California Senate Bill 76, signed by Governor Gavin Newsom in 2023, which allowed San Francisco to establish Entertainment Zones through local ordinances.\n\nLater legislation expanded the idea statewide, with cities like Sacramento implementing their own zones. Now, Loomis, northeast of Sacramento in Placer County, is exploring whether the concept could work in a smaller town.\n\n\"It's not about drinking and partying hard. It's about connecting the businesses together,\" said Nate Peters, owner of Gander Taphouse.\n\nThe idea is drawing mixed reactions from locals. Some see it as a way to boost small businesses and community events.\n\n\"I think it's something that would really help out our businesses,\" said Monica Nickel, who often visits downtown.\n\nOthers worry about changing Loomis' family-friendly feel.\n\n\"My first thoughts were that it would increase the level of intoxicated individuals in our downtown area,\" said Rachel Halverson, a Loomis resident of 17 years. \"You don't need to have an open container and walk place to place. I think we need to concentrate on places for our kids,\" she added.\n\nSupporters say the zone could encourage more mingling and foot traffic downtown.\n\n\"It's nice that we do offer a lot of small family nights, and I think it would continue to promote that people might actually mingle around the whole town more and enjoy more businesses as well,\" Nickel said.\n\nThe town council has formed an Ad Hoc Committee with two members to develop an Entertainment Zone management plan and explore necessary code amendments.\n\n\"The blueprint has been written. It's not that hard to follow. There's rules, there's wristbands, there's cups. We implement because we want this to be a safe and fun thing for families,\" Peters said.\n\nWhile still in the early stages, the proposal is being taken seriously. The next few months will determine whether Loomis moves forward with its own Entertainment Zone.",

        "title": "Military Plans to Fire Artillery Over California Freeway on Saturday",
        "description": "The Marines plan to fire 155-millimeter artillery shells over a major freeway in Southern California on Saturday as part of a demonstration at Camp Pendleton to celebrate the Marine Corps' 250th anniversary.\n\nThe plans to fire over the freeway triggered outrage by Gov. Gavin Newsom late Friday night after his office had been under the impression days earlier that the celebration would not involve firing munitions across Interstate 5, a heavily traveled corridor between Los Angeles and San Diego.\n\n\"This is a profoundly absurd show of force that could put Californians directly in harm's way,\" Mr. Newsom said in a statement to The New York Times.\n\nHe criticized President Trump and said the lack of coordination among state, federal and local officials was creating a dangerous situation. The artillery demonstration, to be attended by Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and military officials, will take place on the same day that anti-Trump activists plan to hold \"No Kings\" protests across the country, including in Southern California.\n\n\"Using our military to intimidate people you disagree with isn't strength -- it's reckless, it's disrespectful, and it's beneath the office the president holds,\" Mr. Newsom said.\n\nBut a spokesman for Mr. Vance said the Marine Corps had assessed that the exercise posed no threat.\n\n\"Gavin Newsom wants people to think this exercise is dangerous,\" William Martin, Mr. Vance's communications director, said in a statement. \"The Marine Corps says it's an established and safe practice. Newsom wants people to think this is an absurd show of force. The Marine Corps says it's part of routine training at Camp Pendleton.\"\n\n\"If Gavin Newsom wants to oppose the training exercises that ensure our Armed Forces are the deadliest and most lethal fighting force in the world, then he can go right ahead,\" Mr. Martin added.\n\nMr. Newsom said he's all for celebrating military heroes but wanted more communication about the plans. The governor's office requested additional information from the military late Friday. State officials said they had received few details from the federal government about the activities involved in Saturday's celebration, other than a request to post a message alerting motorists of live fire on the electronic signs that line the freeway.\n\nA White House official speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the planning said on Friday that the authorities still planned on keeping the freeway open during the demonstration.\n\nThe vice president, himself a former enlisted Marine who served in Iraq, and other dignitaries were expected to observe what the Marine Corps called an \"amphibious capabilities demonstration\" at the base, which may involve active duty Marines coming ashore from the sea at an oceanfront training area.\n\nThat strip of shoreline, called Red Beach, is along Interstate 5 just south of the decommissioned San Onofre nuclear power plant and is closed to the public. It was visited frequently by former President Richard M. Nixon in the 1970s because of the security and seclusion it offered.\n\nTo prepare for Saturday's event, artillery rounds from M777 howitzers were fired from Red Beach east over Interstate 5 on Friday evening as a test run, said Capt. Gregory Dreibelbis, a spokesman for the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force, which is based at Camp Pendleton. Vehicular traffic along the interstate was not closed off while the artillery guns were firing, he said in a statement.\n\n\"M777 artillery pieces have historically been fired during routine training from land-based artillery firing points west of I-5 into impact areas east of the interstate within existing safety protocols and without the need to close the route,\" Capt. Dreibelbis said. He called the test firings an \"established and safe practice\" as a rehearsal for Saturday's event.\n\nThe shells fired by M777 howitzers, which are about six inches in diameter and two feet long, typically weigh about 90 pounds and can be fired at targets more than 15 miles away.\n\nMarine officials did not disclose whether the shells fired Friday were high-explosive rounds, or inert practice projectiles often used for military training.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration has issued what it calls notices to airmen during the vice president's visit, closing some of the airspace near Camp Pendleton while he is expected to be there. Amtrak, which runs the Pacific Surfliner train near the stretch of interstate in question, has canceled rail service in the area from noon to 3 p.m. Pacific time on Saturday.\n\nThe celebration caused confusion earlier this week, when Mr. Newsom first raised concerns that it would involve shooting missiles over the freeway. On Wednesday, his office said that state officials had begun making preliminary plans to close the freeway during the military celebration, but that they were awaiting more details from the federal government.\n\nLate Wednesday night, the Marine Corps issued a statement saying that all events would \"occur on approved training ranges and comport with established safety protocols\" and that no public freeways would be closed.\n\nOn Thursday, Mr. Newsom was asked about the situation while speaking to reporters in Los Angeles.\n\n\"We were under the understanding they were going to close I-5,\" he said, adding that military officials then later \"seemed to back off on that.\"\n\nBut the governor was visibly frustrated that the state wasn't getting the details he felt were necessary to manage the traffic and potential public safety issues posed by the event.\n\n\"So, to be determined, what they are proposing to do,\" he said.\n\nIn June, the Army staged a parade in Washington to celebrate the service's 250th birthday, and the Navy hosted the president and other officials aboard an aircraft carrier off the coast of Virginia earlier this month to celebrate the service's same 250-year milestone.\n\nMr. Trump turned that Navy event into a political rally.",

        "description": "\"I'm not a political hack. I don't serve the party, I always serve the people,\" the former governor adds\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger shared his two cents on Governor Gavin Newsom's Prop 50 measure on \"Real Time With Bill Maher\" Friday evening, where he slammed the political move as \"a big scam.\"\n\nThe actor, who served as the 38th Governor of California between 2003 and 2011, made it clear he wasn't a fan of Newsom's measure, which will authorize temporary changes to the state's congressional district maps -- directly combating similar action being done in Texas.\n\nWhile Newsom has touted Prop 50 as a way to stop President Donald Trump and the Republican party from being able to \"rig the next election,\" Schwarzenegger accused it as evidence of unethical \"gerrymandering\" in today's politics.\n\n\"Do you know who I want to win? The people,\" he said. \"The people have to win. See, I'm a Republican, but I'm not a Republican hack. I'm not a political hack. I don't serve the party, I always serve the people. The people are first.\"\n\nAs he went on, Schwarzenegger warned voters against ripping \"away the power that the people in California have\" and giving \"it back to the politicians\" via Prop 50.\n\nHe added: \"We fought that for too long. Let's not do that. Let's be a good example. Let the Democrats outperform the Republicans, and therefore, because of their performance, win and get the House back.\"\n\nSchwarzenegger later shared how he'd go about \"saving democracy,\" including a suggestion to make Election Day a holiday, independent Redistricting Commissions being in every state and the implementation of a \"voter ID.\" Per \"The Terminator\" star, these are all strategies utilized in Europe.\n\n\"We have to go talk to each other, rather than hating each other,\" he continued. \"Because, that's what the people want and that's what the people need.\"",
