    "title": "This union leader has a warning for Newsom",
    "body": "With help from Noah Baustin, Camille von Kaenel, Saqib Rahim and Garrett Downs\n\nDRAMA ON THE DOCKS: California's clean energy transition is putting a spotlight on state leaders' efforts to usher in new technology without displacing existing jobs. One of the state's largest unions is giving Gov. Gavin Newsom a failing grade.\n\nLocal officials approved a plan this week to speed up adoption of zero-emission equipment at the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. The agreement, in the eyes of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union, which represents West Coast dock workers, is missing a critical piece: guarantees that dock workers won't be rendered irrelevant by automated green machines.\n\nGary Herrera, president of ILWU Local 13, is pointing a finger at Newsom, who last month vetoed SB 34, a labor-backed bill that would have provided some assurances by restricting the use of public funding for automated port equipment. Newsom argued in his veto that the measure would have disrupted negotiations between the ports and air quality officials. But Herrera said the governor declined to speak with the union before rejecting the bill, seriously fracturing his relationship with dockworkers.\n\nHerrera spoke with POLITICO about the possibility that ILWU could withhold an endorsement for Newsom if he runs for president and the union's plans for the upcoming legislative session.\n\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nHow surprised were you that the governor vetoed SB 34?\n\nI was very disappointed. We thought that the governor was going to be proactive in being a very progressive candidate for president. We thought that if anyone's going to solidify his legacy as a governor, what better way to set the tone. The bill had bipartisan support. It was a win for all Californians and for all environmental groups and all labor groups, and he could have taken that and used it as his campaign. That's what we're lacking right now, the type of leadership to bond different groups together, groups that have not historically locked arms.\n\nHe vetoed the bill without even discussing it with us. His response was like he never even read the bill. He listened to the big billionaire companies that continue to try to paint the picture that we were circumventing our collective bargaining agreement by saying no public money for automation. That is so far from the truth, because the companies can still automate. They just have to use their own money. They can't use the taxpayers' money to get rid of the taxpayers' jobs. That's what we were trying to really enforce.\n\nHow is the automation debate going to factor into who ILWU endorses for president?\n\nThis has opened our eyes, and there's going to be a very thorough process. We won't forget what Gov. Newsom has done, and something that we thought was so easy. We feel like labor is on the island, but we need a labor party. We need somebody who can understand that the working class is the backbone of our country. We're not asking to be the richest people. We're asking for respect and dignity so that we can continue to make our families a priority, put our kids through college, put a roof over their heads. And we need a leader like that.\n\nSo the next time somebody comes for endorsement, they will be asked all the right questions. We will thoroughly go through the candidate's resume, and we will not make a decision lightheartedly at all. And if the right person doesn't exist, then we're just not going to pick a party. We need to stand by what we learned through this process.\n\nWhy has the switch to zero-emission equipment created concern about automation and job loss?\n\nWe would make sure that whatever they put in, whether it was electric, whether it was for hydrogen, whether it was for any alternative fuels at all, all the infrastructure would be for human-operated equipment. Without protections, they do what APM Terminals did, which is automate and then eliminate jobs.\n\nIf a company wants to automate, they know they have the right to in our contract. They just have to pay for it themselves. But we're so worried that they're going to find loopholes in the system that's going to use the public money, the workers' money, to eliminate our jobs.\n\nIs ILWU planning to try again by supporting legislation next year similar to the one Newsom vetoed?\n\nNext year, we will focus more on that type of language for not just ourselves. We're looking at cases out there where jobs are being lost to autonomous vehicles, and we don't know if these big companies are using public money to purchase these. What about the big grocery markets that might be using grant money to put in check out services without the human being. We're looking at everything.\n\nYes, it's about the maritime industry, but we are truly looking at any grants that any private organization is using to get rid of the workers. What happens to them? Socially, what happens to them, emotionally? You lose your dignity when you don't have a job.\n\nOther than a possible bill, what are your next steps on this issue?\n\nWe want to work closely with environmental groups to achieve things. Right now in Long Beach, we're putting together a project, a fully zero-emission, human-operated terminal, the first of its kind in the country. That's joining forces with the environmental groups, that's labor, that's sitting down with the ports, that's the kind of innovation we need to achieve the goal together. So that's going to be on the agenda for the next year. -- AN\n\nDid someone forward you this newsletter?

Similarly, Democrats in charge of California vowed to grind any lease sales to a halt in the Golden State through legal and regulatory action.\n\n\"We just can't afford to even give anybody an inch,\" said Rep. Vern Buchanan (R-Fla.), who represents a district situated between Sarasota and Tampa. \"I think that's probably one of my biggest issues since I've been in Congress, which has been for a while, is no drilling off the beaches.\"\n\nAt a Capitol Hill press conference dominated by California Democrats, the lawmakers laid out a strategy to obstruct the plan's implementation in hopes that the party will retake power and kill it altogether.\n\n\"Every time big oil tries to force its way back into California, we stand up and fight and we are ready to begin that fight to do it again,\" said California Rep. Jared Huffman, the top Democrat on the House Natural Resources Committee. \"There's no way we're gonna let this happen to our beautiful California coast on our watch.\" -- GD, NB\n\nWHEELS ON THE BUS: The Trump administration is throwing up roadblocks in front of clean transportation efforts, but federal dollars haven't completely dried up, yet.\n\nSpeaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi and Rep. Kevin Mullin announced Friday that the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency won a $40 million grant to purchase new hybrid diesel-electric buses to replace a portion of the city's aging fleet.\n\nThe award, from the Federal Transit Administration, is a holdover from former President Joe Biden's Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.\n\nPelosi, who wrote a July letter to the administration backing SFMTA's application, used the announcement to take a victory lap Friday.\n\n\"Thanks to Democrats' Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, San Francisco continues to modernize our transportation system while combating the climate crisis,\" Pelosi said in a statement. -- AN\n\nBOUNCE BACK: U.S property insurers made record profits in the third quarter of the year thanks to an unusually quiet hurricane season, reports Saqib Rahim for POLITICO's E&E News.\n\nAfter sustaining heavy losses from the Los Angeles-area wildfires in January, insurers coasted through a 10-month \"string of good fortune on the catastrophe front,\" according to a report by S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nThe period running from July through September includes the Atlantic hurricane season and typically generates the insurance industry's greatest catastrophe losses. But in 2025, insurers had their lowest loss ratio of this century, which compares money earned from premiums to claims they've received.\n\nSeven of the largest property and casualty insurance holding companies had more than $1 billion in underwriting gains in the quarter, S&P found. -- SR, NB\n\n-- Western Senate Democrats are pushing for federal funding to restore public lands recently scorched by wildfires -- like the hundreds of Joshua trees in the namesake national park that burned during the government shutdown.\n\n-- The Sacramento County Board of Supervisors moved a solar farm forward despite local concerns over the loss of oak trees.\n\n-- Chinook salmon are making it further up Alameda Creek this year than seen since the 1950s.\n\nCALIFORNIA POLICY IS ALWAYS CHANGING: Know your next move.

    "body": "Thanks to Newsom, Trump and redistricting, the deep-blue state is in the thick of national politics.\n\nIt's the most populous state in the country, the world's fourth-largest economy and home to two of the last three speakers of the House.\n\nYet California does not always find itself at the center of the national political debate, in large part for its deep-blue nature and its relatively minor role in the presidential nomination process.\n\nThat has changed in 2025.\n\nThe Golden State finds itself squarely in the political spotlight thanks to a confluence of events, some unprecedented and others expected: an overwhelming statewide vote to gerrymander California's House map to help Democrats, the emergence of Gov. Gavin Newsom as a chief Trump critic and potential 2028 candidate, and a competitive, unpredictable primary to succeed him at the end of his term.\n\nThat's not to mention the policy battles between California and the Trump administration over immigration policy and federal funding.\n\nIt's a lot. To help make sense of these swirling stories, we're turning to Laurel Rosenhall, our Sacramento-based reporter who has been covering them closely.\n\nSo, Laurel, how much of California's political resonance has to do with Gavin Newsom, the state's ambitious and loudly anti-Trump governor?\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

    "title": "California voters passed Prop. 36, Sacramento has failed to deliver",
    "body": "The most essential role of government is public safety. When state leaders, like Gov. Gavin Newsom, fail to fund what voters mandated, they fail that basic duty.\n\nA year ago this month, Californians sent a clear message at the ballot box: they're fed up with retail theft, open-air drug scenes, and a justice system that prioritizes criminals over victims. Nearly 70% of California voters in all 58 counties overwhelmingly approved Proposition 36. The ballot measure promised accountability for repeat offenders and treatment for those struggling with addiction. From Marin to Kern County, this anti-crime initiative won support from Democrats, Republicans, and Independents.\n\nA year after voters passed it, there's been no real investment in Prop. 36 due to Gov. Newsom's refusal to adequately fund it. During this past budget cycle, I joined my State Senate Republican colleagues in requesting $400 million for implementation. While this amount is a drop in the bucket, it would have been a meaningful first step. However, the governor only allocated one-time funding of a meager $100 million to be spent over three years with no money going towards probation, which is the accountability part of Prop 36. This is woefully inadequate, and frankly, it is a slap in the face to the Californians who passed it.\n\nWhy should Sacramento fund it? Once voters approved Prop. 36, it's the duty of state government to implement it responsibly. That means ensuring a reliable funding source and working with counties on the treatment infrastructure and court capacity required for success. But that hasn't happened; far from it. As Orange County Sheriff Don Barnes recently stated, \"We specifically need state leaders to fund Proposition 36's treatment-mandated felony programs in order to help those struggling with addiction get the help they need.\"\n\nThe lack of funding has real consequences. Data shows that 9,000 people have been charged under Prop. 36's new \"treatment-mandated felony.\" Yet it is disappointing to learn that only about 1,200 chose treatment, fewer than 800 were placed in programs, and just 25 people statewide have completed treatment. I don't consider this progress, and neither should you.\n\nThe reality is that counties and courts are carrying out the new law without new funding resources. Judges are offering treatment that does not exist. Probation officers and public defenders are overwhelmed. It is obvious that inadequate funding and lack of support shown by the governor is the problem.\n\nWhile counties struggle to acquire much-needed public safety funding, Governor Newsom continues to prioritize money for his pet projects. Among them: a guaranteed funding source of $1 billion per year for the failed bullet train for the next decade; a $750 million bailout for the Bay Area Rapid Transit, also known as BART; $3 billion for the creation of a new, unaccountable Climate Bureau Agency; a slush fund of $70 million for the attorney general to sue the federal government; and lastly, the allocation of nearly $300 million for a special election for Proposition 50. Yet, when it comes to a voter-approved initiative designed to restore public safety for our neighborhoods, this governor says the money isn't available when it should be the priority in his budget. Public safety should always be the number one priority.\n\nWithout real investment, Prop. 36 will fail, just as opponents want. Without proper support, we'll see overcrowded jails instead of recovery, and a continued cycle of addiction and incarceration instead of real change.\n\nJust as we expect lawbreakers to be held accountable, policymakers should be too. Recently, the Democratic-controlled San Diego County Board of Supervisors voted to allocate local funds to implement Prop. 36. While I commend this bold move, counties shouldn't have to do it alone.\n\nI remain committed to advocating for the funding necessary to implement the anti-crime initiative. Californians deserve better. It's time to fund what voters demanded and restore faith in our system.",

    "title": "Even a full reservoir wouldn't have ensured water in Palisades fire, California officials say",
    "body": "Gov. Gavin Newsom called for an investigation. State officials determined that even if the reservoir had been full, the water system still would have been quickly overwhelmed and lost pressure.\n\nIn January, when crews fighting the fast-spreading Palisades fire were hampered by low water pressure and dry hydrants, Gov. Gavin Newsom ordered an investigation.\n\nAfter a 10-month review, California officials concluded in a report that the water supply in Southern California was \"robust\" at the time of the fire and that the water system isn't designed to handle such large, intense wildfires.\n\nThe state's findings, released Thursday, also address an issue that has been a point of frustration and anger among residents in Pacific Palisades: the fact that Santa Ynez Reservoir, which can hold 117 million gallons of drinking water, was empty for repairs at the time of the fire.\n\n\"Draining the Santa Ynez reservoir was necessary to protect public health while repairing the tear in its cover and required by both federal and state regulations,\" the report says. Even if the reservoir had been full, the flow rate in the system's pipes \"would have been a limiting factor in maintaining pressure and the system would have been quickly overwhelmed\" and hydrants would have lost pressure.\n\nThe state's findings are in line with what L.A. water officials have said about the reservoir, the water system and the factors that caused the loss of water pressure.\n\n\"The report confirms that the Santa Ynez Reservoir was offline to make necessary repairs and that issues with water pressure during the fire response were due to the extraordinary demand on the system, not because of inadequate water supply,\" said Ellen Cheng, a spokesperson for the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power.\n\nThe deadly firestorms in Pacific Palisades and Altadena revealed the limitations of California's urban water systems, which experts say are not designed with the capacity for large wildfires that rage through entire neighborhoods.\n\nState officials said in the report that without further data and analysis, it is not clear exactly how much longer a full reservoir might have kept hydrants running, but that \"based on experiences with prior fires,\" the demands on the system were so large that they would have quickly exceeded the system's maximum.\n\nThe L.A. Department of Water and Power said in a July report that the Palisades fire's swift spread \"led to extraordinary demands\" on a part of the system called the Westgate Trunk Line, as firefighters drew from hydrants and residents left sprinklers and hoses running. In addition, as homes burned, water gushed from their damaged pipes, contributing to the loss of pressure.\n\nWhen the system lost pressure in parts of Pacific Palisades, some fire hydrants in high-elevation areas ran dry.\n\nSimilar loss of pressure has occurred during other big California wildfires, including the Tubbs and Thomas fires in 2017 and the Camp and Woolsey fires in 2018.\n\nDWP officials have said they took steps to make water available for firefighters, including by deploying water tankers and trucks to Pacific Palisades. However, the Los Angeles Fire Department said in a report last month that firefighters faced delays in getting vital water trucks into the area.\n\nDuring the fire, water-dropping helicopters were able to refill at DWP's three open-air reservoirs, which, unlike the Santa Ynez Reservoir, are not part of the drinking water system and are available for firefighting. The state's report notes that aircraft were temporarily grounded because of high winds on Jan. 7 and 8 as the fire rapidly spread.\n\nThe Palisades fire killed 12 people and destroyed thousands of homes.\n\nThe state report was prepared for the governor's office by agencies including the California Environmental Protection Agency, California Natural Resources Agency, California Office of Emergency Services, State Water Resources Control Board, Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, and Department of Water Resources.\n\n\"Community water systems facing a large-scale fire are bound by their physical limitations,\" with the flow rate constrained by the capacity of pumps and the piping network, the report says. \"Local water systems and hydrants are not designed to suppress firestorm conditions impacting an entire neighborhood of homes at the same time.\"\n\nThe Palisades and Eaton fires exploded during high winds. After two wet winters that had fed the growth of vegetation on hillsides, Southern California had seen no significant rain in eight months. Scientists have estimated that human-caused global warming probably contributed roughly one-fourth of the dryness, one of the factors that fueled the fires' rapid spread.\n\nState officials noted that large Southern California reservoirs had ample water at the time of the fires, and that the local system in Pacific Palisades lost pressure \"not due to a lack of water supply in the system, but because of an insufficient flow rate.\"\n\n\"Even though there was plenty of water available in the system, it was not possible to pump enough water to the fire area all at once to meet the flow rate demand created by the leaking water from already destroyed structures and high water use from hydrants,\" the report says.\n\nA 20-member independent commission, the Blue Ribbon Commission on Climate Action and Fire-Safe Recovery, said in a June report that \"protecting water supply and pressure for firefighting will require a coordinated regional approach, collaboration across agencies, and flexible access to alternative sources.\"\n\nMark Gold, a member of the commission, said given the extreme dryness and fire risks, it was \"not a good time to be doing large-scale maintenance projects that are going to keep any part of your water system offline.\"\n\n\"We've got to be way smarter in taking into account the local conditions when we have any part of our water infrastructure offline,\" he said.\n\nTo prepare for major fires intensified by extreme weather, the state report says, it's essential to focus on having crews and equipment, including water tanker trucks, in place ahead of time to ensure there is water if hydrants run out.\n\nDWP faces lawsuits filed by homeowners, who argue the utility failed to prepare for and adequately respond to the fire. The agency has said its crews and water system were prepared for emergency situations, but that \"no urban water system is designed to combat a massive, wind-driven wildfire of the speed and scale\" of the Palisades fire.\n\nState officials said that with the risks of such extreme events increasing with climate change, efforts to fully implement a list of fire safety measures outlined in the state wildfire plan are crucial.\n\n\"California faces a fire year rather than a fire season,\" the state report says. \"And catastrophic wildfires affecting communities in the wildland urban interface can be driven and exacerbated by extreme weather events.\"",

    "title": "'Dead in the water': Gavin Newsom slams Trump on 'reckless' oil drilling plan",
    "body": "Gavin Newsom has slammed Donald Trump's oil drilling plans for California and Florida.\n\nThe governor of California called the plans \"reckless\" in a statement released on Thursday. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum called the oil drilling plan a \"forward-thinking\" project, which he says would make American energy \"dominant\" for years to come.\n\nHe said, \"The Biden administration slammed the brakes on offshore oil and gas leasing and crippled the long-term pipeline of America's offshore production. By moving forward with the development of a robust, forward-thinking leasing plan, we are ensuring that America's offshore industry stays strong, our workers stay employed, and our nation remains energy dominant for decades to come.\"\n\nBut Newsom has called the project \"idiotic\" and said that it will not only harm Californians but is an \"attempt to sell\" to Big Oil donors. Newsom said, \"Trump's idiotic plan endangers our coastal economy and communities and hurts the well-being of Californians. This reckless attempt to sell out our coastline to his Big Oil donors is dead in the water.\"\n\n\"For decades, California has stood firm in our opposition to new offshore drilling, and nothing will change that.\" Newsom has previously aired his support for greater offshore controls following a spill at Huntington Beach in 2021. He also backed a congressional effort to ban new offshore drilling projects on the West Coast.\n\nTrump's plan has faced opposition from the League of Conservation Voters, which called Trump's offshore drilling plan \"dangerous\" in a statement released earlier this week.\n\nAmerica Fitzpatrick, the group's conservation program director, said, \"This needless, reckless expansion of offshore drilling would jeopardize our coastal communities, public health, local economies, and the environment, while prolonging our dependence on fossil fuels and doing nothing to lower costs.\"\n\nIt follows a statement released by Senator Rick Scott earlier this month, who announced that oil drilling would be banned through 2032, CBS reported.\n\nScott said, \"As Floridians, we know how vital our beautiful beaches and coastal waters are to our state's economy, environment, and way of life. It's why I have fought for years to keep drilling off Florida's coasts and worked closely with President Trump during his first term to ensure they remain protected with the president's moratorium, which bans oil drilling through 2032.\"\n\n\"I am proud to put these efforts into law with the American Shores Protection Act. I will always work to keep Florida's shore pristine and protect our natural treasures for generations to come.\"",

    "body": "\"I'm running for Governor because prices are too high and people are scared,\" he wrote.\n\nA Swalwell candidacy was on nobody's radar just a few months ago. His decision to enter the race late in the year -- when other candidates have had as much as a year's head start -- is the latest sign of an unsettled Democratic field in the race to succeed Gavin Newsom, with no decisive frontrunner.\n\nThe leading Democrat, Katie Porter, has been hobbled by unflattering viral videos, while former Health Secretary Xavier Becerra and former Los Angeles mayor Antonio Villaraigosa have struggled to break into double-digits in the polls. The other contenders -- state schools chief Tony Thurmond, former state controller Betty Yee, entrepreneur Stephen J. Cloobeck and former assemblymember Ian Calderon -- have failed to break out from the bottom of the pack.\n\nOther potential entrants to the race include a pair of billionaire entrepreneurs -- Tom Steyer and Rick Caruso -- while some Sacramento players have encouraged Attorney General Rob Bonta to take another look at the race.\n\nSwalwell, who began his congressional career by ousting a 40-year Democratic incumbent, has built his profile on relentless criticism of Trump. He parlayed his regular appearances on cable news into a short-lived presidential run, which ended after three months in 2019.\n\n\"I've been in these fights as a city council member up in Dublin, my hometown, as a prosecutor in Oakland and taking on the most corrupt president ever in the U.S. Congress, but I'm ready to bring this fight home,\" Swalwell told Kimmel on his show.\n\nSwalwell's persistent needling of the president has made him a target of the administration. Last week, a Trump official alleged Swalwell committed mortgage fraud -- a recurring accusation against Trump's enemies such as New York Attorney General Letitia James, who was indicted last month, and California Sen. Adam Schiff -- and referred the case to the Department of Justice for possible investigation.\n\nSwalwell has also become an object of derision on the right, where his detractors are quick to point out his previous ties to a Chinese spy who sought to influence American politicians. Swalwell has said he cooperated with the FBI when he was alerted to her work for the Chinese government and that he immediately cut off contact.\n\nWhile his combat with Trump has made him a hero to grassroots Democrats, he will need to play significant catch-up for his nascent campaign. He has roughly $500,000 in his congressional campaign account, which he could put toward his race. He also is not particularly well-known among Sacramento power brokers, which means he'll have to quickly build relationships to secure major endorsements that could give his campaign a boost.",

    "title": "Report shows how Eaton fire moved west, into Altadena, well before many were alerted",
    "body": "A new report commissioned by Gov. Gavin Newsom on the spread of the Palisades and Eaton fires suggests that the movement of the Eaton fire from east Pasadena into west Altadena occurred earlier than originally reported, leaving questions on whether evacuation orders should have come sooner.\n\nThe Eaton fire, which started at 6:18 p.m. Jan. 7 near high-tension electrical towers in rugged Eaton Canyon, burned homes in east Pasadena, torched rugged terrain in the San Gabriel Mountains, then when winds shifted, moved toward west Altadena as early as 9:20 p.m, according to the Fire Safety Research Institute's Southern California Fires Timeline Report.\n\nBy 10:50 p.m. Jan. 7, there were fire calls for a roof on fire of a home on Calaveras Street in Altadena, two blocks west of Lake Avenue and three blocks south of East Altadena Drive. The is significant because it shows embers burning homes outside the fire's perimeter.\n\nFrom tracking 911 calls and using pictures of houses on fire with timestamps from residents, the report, released on Thursday, Nov. 20, put together a lengthy timeline of when the Eaton fire had moved from east Pasadena to west Altadena.\n\nMany west Altadena residents told the Southern California News Group that they did not receive alerts to evacuate until 3 a.m., with some saying they got an alert at 5 a.m. on the morning of Jan. 8, more than 10 hours after the fire began. The report cites calls of homes on fire in west Altadena hours before that time.\n\nMore timely alerts to evacuate may have helped more victims get out sooner, before the flames burned down their homes.\n\nThe Eaton fire claimed the lives of 19 residents, with 18 from the west Altadena area. That part of Altadena, with mostly older, modest homes and an area occupied by Black residents, were populated with houses passed down from generation to generation over decades.\n\nThe Eaton fire also destroyed 9,413 structures while burning through 14,021 acres.\n\n\"Our report represents a critical first step in understanding how the Southern California fires last January progressed -- and how agencies responded during this unprecedented event,\" wrote Steve Kerber, vice president and executive director of the Fire Safety Research Institute (FSRI) in a forward to the FSRI report.\n\nThe Eaton fire may have started due to the sparking of power line at Eaton Canyon that has been inactive for decades. This is a theory that Southern California Edison, the owners of the power towers, have suggested as a possible cause but no cause has been determined.\n\nMore than 130 lawsuits have been filed blaming SCE's equipment for sparking the fire, through an idle transmission line that potentially became re-energized after more than 50 years.\n\nThe fire spread quickly due to very dry conditions, low humidity, and an unusually fierce wind storm that hit the eastern San Gabriel Mountains and also, drove the fire in the Palisades and Malibu from the rugged Santa Monica Mountains, the report stated.\n\nThe report pointed out that firefighters were overwhelmed fighting a fire on the eastern Eaton front, near where it started, and then simultaneously on the northwest and into urban Altadena between Lake Avenue and Lincoln Avenue, north of central Pasadena.\n\nThe timeline says flames and embers were torching homes and businesses in Altadena in the early morning hours of Jan. 8, while also burning in the southwest and along the eastern edge of the fire in Sierra Madre.\n\nJust after midnight until 1:17 a.m., the fire was spreading both east and west \"including reports of fire activity along and west of Lake Avenue\" (in Altadena), the report said.\n\nBy 3:17 a.m. the fire's change in direction was complete and was now largely burning down house after house in urban Altadena west of Lake Avenue. The timeline reports at least five alarm calls between 2:32 a.m. and 3:14 a.m. on Jan. 8 in western Altadena, roughly in an area encompassing Maiden Lane, Porter Avenue, East Palm Street and East Mendocino Street.\n\n\"During this time, fire activity west of Lake Avenue increased dramatically, particularly north of East Palm Street,\" said the timeline section of the report, complete with pictures of homes on fire. Shortly after 2 a.m. Los Angeles County Sheriff deputies reported \"they could see fire in the foothills north of Farnsworth Park.\"\n\nThe park was severely damaged in the fire and has not reopened as the county searches for funding.\n\nAfter 3:17 a.m., most of the fire activity was north of East Palm Street but continued moving west into the vicinity of Fair Oaks Avenue. In this area between 4:18 a.m. and 5:17 a.m., about 10 hours after the start of the fire, the majority of the fire was burning west of Lake Avenue.\n\nThe report said at that time, there were 24 fire alarms sounded and 30 smoke alarms. In multiple cases automatic alarms were coming from the same address.\n\nAlso, evidence of the flames and embers now destroying property in west Altadena comes from a SCE weather station on West Poppyfields Drive and Olive Avenue. The temperature reading increased from 57 degrees after 4 a.m. to 119 degrees at 5:30 a.m.\n\nThis report is one of two. A second report is due out sometime next year.\n\n\"The analysis in the second report will look to understand pre-existing conditions in the fire areas, the influence of the built environment on fire behavior, first responders' actions, and emergency response agencies' capabilities for addressing urban conflagrations,\" according to the report.",

    "title": "No signs California won't move forward with redistricting despite a court blocking similar plan in Texas",
    "body": "After a panel of federal judges in Texas this week struck down that state's recently redrawn congressional maps, voters in California might be wondering if that means the Golden State will halt its own mid-decade redistricting plan.\n\nAfter all, when Gov. Gavin Newsom and other California Democrats began talking about redistricting early on, they framed it as a counter to the gerrymandering in Texas that was meant to benefit Republicans there. In selling the idea to voters that California should adopt new maps that benefit Democrats, Newsom said, just before he signed a bill to call the special election, \"We're responding (to) what occurred in Texas; we're neutralizing what occurred.\"\n\nHowever, now that Texas may not be able to move forward with its redistricting plan -- the recent decision could still be overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court -- some voters may wonder if California ought to proceed with its new maps.\n\nNewsom's office confirmed that California can still go forward with its plan because it is not contingent on what happens in any other state.\n\nThat's because on the day the California Legislature passed bills to call for a special election and put new maps before voters, language that said California's new maps would be implemented \"only if Texas, Florida, or another state adopts a new congressional district map\" was removed. At the time, a spokesperson for Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas said that wording was removed because Texas had, by then, voted to redistrict.\n\n\"Because Texas Republicans have voted,\" spokesperson Nick Miller said in an August email, \"the original trigger language in our measure is no longer necessary.\"\n\n\"To make sure the measure is clear to California voters when they have the final say, it has been removed,\" he added.\n\nSome voters may still be surprised, though, thinking California would only move forward with redistricting if Texas does. The title of the ballot measure had stated that Proposition 50 \"authorizes temporary changes to congressional district maps in response to Texas' partisan redistricting.\"\n\n\"There is more than one reason that Californians may feel misled, including the reason for (our) lawsuit,\" Mike Columbo, the lead attorney in a case challenging the state's new congressional maps, said in an email.\n\nThat lawsuit -- brought by California Republicans, and which the U.S. Department of Justice later joined -- alleged California's maps are unconstitutional because districts were racially gerrymandered. A spokesperson for Newsom previously expressed confidence that the state will prevail in court.\n\nAsked if California still plans to redistrict in light of this week's ruling on the Texas maps, Newsom's office responded with a statement from the governor: President Donald Trump and Texas Gov. Greg Abbott \"played with fire, got burned -- and democracy won. This ruling is a win for Texas, and for every American who fights for free and fair elections.\"\n\nTo be clear: Texas has filed an appeal with the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn the 2-1 decision by the federal district court judges. Should the nation's highest court ultimately side with Texas, the maps that Abbott is pushing for could be implemented after all.\n\nMeanwhile, irrespective of the Texas case, there's still the matter of the Republicans' lawsuit challenging California's maps.\n\nWith that case still pending, voters and candidates alike may be asking what this means for California and the 2026 midterm elections. When will they know what the districts look like?\n\nAfter all, a key date for candidates is coming up: Starting Dec. 19, candidates who don't want to pay the filing fee to run for a House seat can begin gathering voter signatures to have the fee waived.\n\nKnowing by then what the boundaries are for the district they're running in is important, said Columbo.\n\n\"It will create a problem for voters and those candidates if the districts change after that date,\" he said.\n\nHis team is seeking a preliminary injunction and requesting that California's current congressional maps -- used in the 2024 elections -- remain in place until a final decision is rendered about the legality of those established by Proposition 50.\n\nA three-judge panel will hear the matter on Dec. 3, and attorneys for the plaintiffs have asked for a decision on the preliminary injunction by Dec. 5 so that if the losing side appeals, the U.S. Supreme Court would have two weeks to weigh in before Dec. 19, Columbo said.\n\n\"The reason we are asking for such a quick decision is to avoid the confusion and disruption that would occur if we don't have a decision by Dec. 19 and then later, the court determines that the maps are unconstitutional,\" he said.\n\nOnce it's established which maps candidates will run on, the lawsuit challenging the Proposition 50 maps would proceed as normal through the court process, Columbo said.\n\nSuch a plan is not unheard of.\n\nJessica Levinson, a professor at Loyola Law School who has taught courses on constitutional law and election law, said in these types of cases, a court generally will indicate which map shall be used for the next election while a case is still being heard.\n\nThat happened, she said, with an ongoing U.S. Supreme Court case that centers around Louisiana's congressional maps.\n\n\"People need to know which lines are in place before they have to declare their candidacy,\" Levinson said. \"Judges will have to give some indication about whether or not the new lines can be used. That will obviously have huge implications for who runs, in which district and what the contest looks like.\"\n\n\"We just need to know which lines to use,\" she added. \"But the case doesn't need to have a final resolution\" yet.\n\nIn the meantime, candidates have already started announcing their plans to run in districts based on the Proposition 50 maps. With California's June 2 primary election just over six months away, a number of candidates have started fundraising and seeking endorsements.",

    "title": "US Unveils Plan for Oil and Gas Auctions off California Coast",
    "body": "(Reuters) -The Trump administration on Thursday unveiled a five-year plan to hold as many as 34 auctions for oil and gas drilling rights leases in the Gulf of Mexico and in federal waters off the coasts of Alaska and California.\n\nThe Interior Department proposal is aligned with President Donald Trump's energy-dominance agenda to supercharge domestic fossil fuel production. It is likely to set off a fresh conflict with California Governor Gavin Newsom, a Democrat who is among the president's harshest critics.\n\nThe plan contemplates 21 sales off the coast of Alaska starting next year, seven in the Gulf of Mexico and six in the Pacific Ocean from northern to southern California.\n\nOil and gas leases in federal waters accounted for 14% of U.S. oil production and 2% of domestic natural gas production in fiscal-year 2024, according to federal data. The vast majority of that output is from leases in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nThe proposal would replace a schedule set by the administration of former President Joe Biden that included just three lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\n\"The Biden administration slammed the brakes on offshore oil and gas leasing and crippled the long-term pipeline of America's offshore production,\" Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said in a statement. \"By moving forward with the development of a robust, forward-thinking leasing plan, we are ensuring that America's offshore industry stays strong, our workers stay employed, and our nation remains energy dominant for decades to come.\"\n\nFederal waters typically start 3 nautical miles off the coast and extend about 200 nautical miles.\n\nOil and gas industry groups praised the plan.\n\n\"We commend Secretary Burgum and the Department of the Interior for taking this important step to fix a leasing program that was wholly insufficient,\" National Ocean Industries Association President Erik Milito said in a statement. \"We look forward to working with policymakers to ensure the Gulf continues to lead America's energy future.\"\n\nThe Trump plan does not include any sales in the Atlantic Ocean. The Republican governor of South Carolina had asked for his state to be left out of the plan, as had the Democratic governor of North Carolina.\n\nNewsom has said that any plan to open up drilling in federal waters off the coast of his state would be \"dead on arrival.\"\n\nHis office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nConservation groups derided the proposal.\n\n\"This draft plan is an oil spill nightmare!\" Oceana Campaign Director Joseph Gordon said in a statement. \"The last thing America needs now is a massive expansion of offshore drilling that could shut down our shores with catastrophic oil spills.\"\n\n(Reporting by Nichola Groom in Los Angeles; Editing by Rod Nickel and Matthew Lewis)",

    "title": "The Kamala Harris, Gavin Newsom cage match",
    "body": "On her never-ending book tour this week, former Vice President Kamala Harris shouted to the audience, \"Release the files!\" in reference to the infamous Epstein files and what President Trump should do with them.\n\nNever mind that she was vice president for four years and never mentioned Jeffrey Epstein's name. Democrats during the Biden administration were too busy expanding the size of the federal government and lining their own pockets to give any attention to Epstein's victims or demand that the Biden White House release the files.\n\nYet Ms. Harris has her eyes on a 2028 presidential run and is desperate to remain relevant.\n\n\"I am not done. I have lived my entire career as a life of service, and it's in my bones,\" she said about her plans.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom is also making the media rounds, fueling speculation of his 2028 aspirations, and potential cage match with Ms. Harris, for the top of the Democratic presidential ticket.\n\n\"Is it fair to say about the 2026 midterms, you're going to give [a 2028 presidential run] serious thought?\" a reporter recently asked him.\n\n\"Yeah, I'd be lying otherwise,\" Mr. Newsom replied. \"I'd just be lying. And I'm not -- I can't do that.\"\n\nLast week, Mr. Newsom was in Brazil at the COP30 climate summit, acting as if he were the king of America in Mr. Trump's absence.\n\n\"[Trump is] an invasive species. ... He's a wrecking ball president. And he's trying to roll back progress of the last century. ... He's doubling down on stupid,\" Mr. Newsom preached to the globalist crowd.\n\nMeanwhile, 5,000 miles away in California, residents are experiencing the highest gas prices in the country. His state has lost $370 billion in the past 10 years as high earners fled. None of his green policies has helped lower the average Californian's cost of living.\n\nStill, Mr. Newsom is coming off a win, with residents approving his redistricting efforts this month, voting in favor of Prop 50. The effort netted Mr. Newsom about $40 million in small-dollar donations, allowing him to invest in his 2028 ambitions.\n\n\"Gavin's infrastructure is a highly developed, ready-for-president infrastructure,\" a Newsom insider told Vanity Fair this week. \"It was that last year, and it is even more so now.\"\n\n\"He has the ability to help next year in a way that few other people in politics do,\" another Newsom ally told Vanity Fair of the 2026 midterms. \"If we win the House back next year, he's going to be the guy who did that.\"\n\nMs. Harris and Mr. Newsom got their starts in Democratic politics courtesy of San Francisco kingmaker Willie Brown. Three decades ago, Mr. Brown appointed Ms. Harris to multiple state boards and then, as mayor, helped position her for a role in the district attorney's office. Around the same time, Mr. Brown appointed Mr. Newsom to the city's Parking and Traffic Commission and then to the city's Board of Supervisors, which helped him mount a successful run for mayor.\n\nNow, Ms. Harris and Mr. Newsom appear to be on a collision course for the White House, with little affection between them.\n\nIn her book \"107 Days,\" Ms. Harris recalls how she tried to contact Mr. Newsom after President Biden decided not to seek reelection, catapulting her to the top of the ticket. Mr. Newsom's reply was \"Hiking. Will call back.\"\n\n\"He never did,\" Ms. Harris wrote.\n\nMr. Newsom told reporters he didn't recognize Ms. Harris' number and quickly drafted a letter of endorsement, which he assumed was also detailed in the book. It was not.\n\n\"As the Democratic Party, we have a lot of work to do to make up for our failures in the past,\" Mr. Newsom told Stephen Colbert last month. \"We got crushed in this last election.\"\n\nMs. Harris disagrees.\n\nShe claims she was the \"most qualified candidate ever\" to run as president and has touted her skills at playing \"three-dimensional chess\" on the campaign trail, avoiding Mr. Trump's traps.\n\nAll chess is played in three dimensions, and Ms. Harris lost the election.\n\nWithout Mr. Trump on the ticket in 2028, Mr. Newsom and Ms. Harris will be left to define their own visions for America and defend their own records.",

    "title": "Trump administration proposes opening waters off California and Florida to oil drilling",
    "body": "The administration's announcement also sticks an oily thumb into the eye of the international climate community currently meeting in Brazil to discuss, among other things, ways to ratchet down global greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n\"The Biden administration slammed the brakes on offshore oil and gas leasing and crippled the long-term pipeline of America's offshore production,\" Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said in a statement. \"By moving forward with the development of a robust, forward-thinking leasing plan, we are ensuring that America's offshore industry stays strong, our workers stay employed, and our nation remains energy dominant for decades to come.\"\n\nThe plan's offering of new leases in California waters -- reported by POLITICO last month -- looks designed to antagonize Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, a potential 2028 presidential contender who in recent months has sought to moderate his position on fossil fuel production. Newsom, speaking at the COP 30 conference, called the administration's move to open new waters off the California coast to drilling \"dead on arrival.\"\n\nRich Goldberg, who served as a senior counselor to the Trump administration's National Energy Dominance Council through August, said in an interview that oil and gas issues present a clear policy split between the Trump administration, which has gone all-in on oil and gas development, and California, which has emphasized renewable energy.\n\n\"This is really a core fight and the demonstration of two world views that come to have concrete results in one of our largest states,\" Goldberg said. \"So this is a fight worth taking on to have a very public demonstration of the contrast in policies and results.\"\n\nThe plan proposes sales off Southern California in 2027, 2029 and 2030, off Central California in 2027 and 2029, and Northern California in 2029.\n\nCompanies are already producing oil and gas off the California coast in territory originally leased by the mid-1980s, but drilling there has declined for decades. A series of congressional and presidential actions stifled new leasing in the Pacific and strict environmental regulations made it difficult to transport the oil from federal waters to the state's coastline. A recent effort by one company, Sable Offshore Corp., to restart production off Southern California has run into major state and local opposition.\n\nThe proposal to lease acres in the resource-rich eastern Gulf of Mexico, which President Donald Trump has renamed the Gulf of America, could also run into political headwinds. The plan includes sales in the region, which oil companies have long sought to tap, in 2029 and 2030, after the Trump administration leaves office.\n\nFlorida politicians of both parties have opposed drilling for decades over fears that an oil spill would devastate the state's tourism industry. After the first Trump administration's plan to open up nearly all federal waters to drilling drew heavy backlash, Trump extended a preexisting moratorium on drilling off Florida's coasts until 2032.\n\nIt was not immediately clear whether the new proposed sales fall within the moratorium, which extends roughly 125 miles offshore.\n\nRepublican lawmakers have already panned the idea after POLITICO reported last month that the plan would include the eastern Gulf and Atlantic coasts. The Republican pushback persuaded the administration to remove the Atlantic coast from consideration, POLITICO also reported.\n\nEven without any Atlantic sales, the proposal would tee up auctions in regions with serious political and economic hurdles to development, such as Alaska's High Arctic. That will test oil companies' willingness to \"drill, baby, drill,\" especially as crude prices remain low.\n\nThe plan includes 21 sales off Alaska, mostly in 2030 or later. It includes sales each year beginning in 2027 in the Cook Inlet, sales in the Beaufort Sea in 2026 and 2030, Chukchi Sea in 2028 and 2030, and the High Arctic in 2030.\n\nThe last Arctic Ocean lease sale was held in 2008. An attempt by Shell to drill in the region in 2012 ended in a high-profile failure.\n\nThe aggressive leasing schedule would represent a major jump from the current plan, which was finalized under the Biden administration and remains in effect. That plan includes just three offshore lease sales between 2024 and 2029, the fewest since the modern offshore program began in 1980.\n\nInterior's plan, a framework used to schedule offshore lease sales in federal waters for a five-year period, could still change before it is finalized, likely next year.\n\nThe discretionary sales in Thursday's plan are in addition to dozens of lease sales mandated under Republicans' new budget law, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, in the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska's Cook Inlet.\n\nEnvironmental groups have criticized the Trump administration's leasing push, arguing oil companies already producing at record levels don't need additional acreage offshore. They also point to the potential impact on endangered species such as whales, which the administration has sought to protect by throttling the growth of offshore wind.\n\n\"The last thing America needs now is a massive expansion of offshore drilling that could shut down our shores with catastrophic oil spills,\" Joseph Gordon, campaign director at Oceana, said in a statement. \"Congress, and coastal state leaders, must stand together to defend all of our coasts and demand that the Trump administration go back to the drawing board to take their states out of the final plan.\"\n\nBut Erik Milito, president of the National Ocean Industries Association, said the expansion of lease sales into new regions like the Eastern Gulf would be critical to maintain U.S. competitiveness, especially as onshore shale wells get less productive.\n\n\"We need to make sure we're not missing out on potential strategic opportunities 10, 15, 20 years down the road, because the production we have now is because of decisions we made 10, 15 years ago,\" Milito said in an interview prior to the plan's release.\n\nMilito said casting a \"wide net\" in the proposed plan would allow the government to gather input from companies on the areas' geology and potential drilling interest, which could then be used to narrow the final plan.\n\nThe first Trump administration proposed an initial plan with 47 lease sales off nearly every coast, but ultimately pared it down to just 11 auctions, 10 in the Gulf of Mexico and one in Alaska's Cook Inlet.\n\nInterior's Bureau of Ocean Energy Management is set to hold its first offshore lease sale under the Trump administration in December, auctioning off roughly 80 million acres in the Gulf of Mexico. The sale was one of the three scheduled under the Biden administration's plan, and was also mandated in the budget law. Environmental groups sued Interior on Tuesday to block the sale.\n\nBOEM will take public comment on the draft leasing schedule for 60 days beginning Nov. 24. The agency typically releases a second draft narrowing the initial proposed program and takes public comment again before finalizing the plan.",

    "body": "Sean McCluskie, a former longtime political aide to Xavier Becerra, pleaded guilty to charges in connection with stealing funds from Becerra's dormant California campaign account on Thursday.\n\nMcCluskie is one of four co-conspirators listed in a federal indictment that accused Gov. Gavin Newsom's former chief of staff, Dana Williamson, of 23 fraud-related charges.\n\nHe pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud and wire fraud and one count of conspiracy to defraud the United States.\n\nGreg Campbell and McCluskie appeared in court last Friday, when they both pleaded not guilty. Campbell is expected to change his plea during his Dec. 4 court hearing.\n\n\"Mr. Campbell takes full accountability for his actions and is cooperating fully with the legal process,\" Campbell's attorney, Todd Pickles, said in a statement after Friday's court hearing.\n\nIf Williamson's case goes to trial, the two men could testify against her for a lesser punishment for their accused crimes.\n\nThe indictment alleges that Williamson, along with help from Campbell, developed a plan with McCluskie to take money from Becerra's dormant state campaign account in 2022.\n\nBecerra is a former member of Congress and was appointed California Attorney General in 2017. He was then reelected in 2018, when Williamson ran his campaign. Becerra was later appointed by former President Joe Biden as Secretary of Health and Human Services.\n\nMcCluskie was Becerra's longtime aide, including Becerra's former chief of staff.\n\nThe federal documents said about $225,000 was stolen from Becerra's dormant campaign account and used for personal use.\n\nCampbell is accused of coordinating the theft through his companies and helping cover it up.\n\nThe court documents alleged Becerra did not know about the scheme. Newsom's office said last week that the governor was unaware of any investigation involving him, and that Williamson was placed on leave in late 2024 after learning she was under criminal investigation.\n\nAccording to the indictment, Williamson allegedly subscribed to false tax returns, claiming more than $1 million in business deductions that were for personal use and nondeductible expenditures, like private jet travel, hotel stays, home furnishings and designer handbags.\n\nIn her first court appearance last week, Williamson pleaded not guilty to the charges. If convicted, she could face up to 20 years in prison.",

Gavin Newsom over a California measure that gives illegal immigrants access to in-state tuition benefits, marking the third lawsuit in one week that the department has brought against the high-profile Democratic governor.\n\nThe lawsuit, brought in the Eastern District of California, alleged that California's education code caused out-of-state U.S. citizens to pay higher tuition rates at California's schools than people living in the country illegally.\n\nThe attorneys called it \"unequal treatment\" that was \"squarely at odds\" with federal law, which states that people unlawfully residing in the United States cannot be given tuition benefits based on residence that U.S. citizens are not also entitled to.\n\nThe DOJ has brought similar lawsuits in several other states, including . That case was put on hold for weeks because of the government shutdown.\n\nMinnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, an elected Democrat, has moved to have the lawsuit dismissed, arguing that the DOJ is not properly reading the federal laws and that U.S. citizens do indeed have the same benefits as undocumented immigrants.\n\nFox News Digital reached out to Newsom's office for comment.\n\nAshley Oliver is a reporter for Fox News Digital and FOX Business, covering the Justice Department and legal affairs.

    "body": "On Wednesday, the state's nonpartisan Legislative Analyst's Office published its fiscal outlook for the 2026-2027 fiscal year -- and it's not pretty.\n\n\"Under our revenue and spending estimates, the Legislature faces an almost $18 billion budget problem in 2026-27,\" the LAO reports. \"This is about $5 billion larger than the budget problem anticipated by the administration in June, despite improvements in revenue.\"\n\nNew revenues, they explain, are almost entirely consumed by mandated spending obligations like Proposition 98, which requires minimum funding levels for the state's education system.\n\nIn addition, perennial problems like rising pension costs and health benefits for government retirees continue to erode finite resources.\n\nThe report also notes that California will be spending $850 million more in the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. Gov. Gavin Newsom's alliance with the prison guards union has meant union dollars have propped up his political campaigns in exchange for his support of lucrative contracts for the union.\n\nThe LAO notes the state's budget problem is projected to only get worse after next year.\n\n\"Starting in 2027-28, we estimate structural deficits to grow to about $35 billion annually due to spending growth continuing to outstrip revenue growth,\" they note. But California will be facing this in a worse position than in years past because \"the state has used most of its budget resiliency tools to address prior deficits\" already. This includes, \"over $20 billion in borrowing, one-time and temporary spending solutions are exhausted, and budget reserves are at about half of their peak.\"\n\nIn the face of higher deficits, this is certainly a problem and means the termed-out Newsom is getting out just in time.\n\nThe LAO notes that even if the state saw significant levels of revenue growth, increased spending obligations are likely to outpace what's reasonable to expect.\n\nThis is all the consequence of mismanagement and short-sightedness by the state's Democratic supermajority, which has always preferred to spend whatever it can regardless of the outcomes or costs.\n\nWe know Newsom and the current crop of state leaders are competent only at shellgames and buck-passing, so we don't expect much from them. But we certainly hope California voters elect better leaders at the next available opportunity. Preferably leaders with basic budgeting skills and appreciation for even rudimentary math.",

Gavin Newsom's former chief of staff, Dana Williamson, faces nearly two-dozen fraud-related charges, alleging that she and multiple co-conspirators took money from former state Attorney General Xavier Becerra's dormant California campaign account.\n\nCBS News Sacramento obtained a copy of one of the letters that the FBI sent out, which tells recipients that even if they were not a target of this investigation, some of their phone conversations have been recorded. The FBI said this was part of a court order allowing investigators to intercept wire and electronic communications between May and June of 2024.\n\nSome people currently in Newsom's office received the letter. A spokesperson for the governor said Newsom did not.\n\nAndrew Acosta is a Democratic strategist watching the bombshell court case against Williamson, former Becerra chief of staff Sean McCluskie, and lobbyist Greg Campbell play out.\n\n\"Does it end with these three or is there other stuff that's going to be uncovered?\" Acosta said. \"I think that's what everyone is sort of wondering.\"\n\nThe federal indictment naming the three includes references to wiretapping, with investigators listening to phone calls and reading text messages and emails.\n\nThis is not the first FBI investigation at the Capitol.\n\nIn 2013, agents were seen leaving Capitol offices with boxes in a federal probe of Senator Ron Calderon and his brother, Tom Calderon, in a money laundering case.\n\nIn 2014, Senator Leland Yee was arrested in a gun trafficking case, and in 1988, the Shrimp scam case led to the conviction of 12 public officials in a bribery case.",

    "body": "California is projected to face a $18 billion deficit next year, setting up a challenge for Gov. Gavin Newsom to safeguard some of the progressive policies that have defined his tenure as he considers a presidential run.\n\nThe nonpartisan Legislative Analyst's Office projected the shortfall in a report released Wednesday. It would mark the state's fourth deficit in a row, including last year's $12 billion shortfall. State spending continues to grow much faster than revenues, and new federal policy changes to health care and food assistance programs for low-income people will also increase costs for the state by $1.3 billion, the report says.\n\nNewsom will release his own budget estimates in January as he lays out a spending proposal for the next fiscal year; sometimes his office disagrees with the LAO and paints a rosier financial picture. His second and final term as governor ends in January 2027, and this year's budget will be his last say on how money is spent in the nation's most populous state. Governors in California are limited to two terms.\n\nNew federal policies on tariffs and ongoing high borrowing costs are leading to weaker corporate and sales tax trends and sluggish job growth, Legislative Analyst Gabriel Petek said at a briefing Wednesday.\n\nThe only bright spot has come almost exclusively from strong investments in artificial intelligence, allowing the state to collect billions more in personal income tax than projected. But most of those revenue gains must go toward schools and paying down state debt. The report also warns that the AI investments might not be sustainable in the long run.\n\n\"It's risky to assume that these trends will just continue unabated,\" Petek said. He added: \"The budget condition right now has become relative weak.\"\n\nFor Newsom, how he balances the budget without abandoning Democrats' priority programs will help shape his national image as he mulls a presidential run.\n\nHe already had to roll back a signature health care program last year, dealing a major blow to state Democrats' priority of providing universal health care. The ambitious state-funded program started in 2024 to provide free health care to immigrants living in California regardless of their legal status. Those without legal status will no longer be eligible to enroll in the program starting next year, and some will have to start paying a premium in 2027.\n\nState Democratic leaders in the past few years have avoided some of the deepest cuts to their priorities by borrowing from special funds and delaying payments to plug the budget hole. But they're running out of most temporary and one-time solutions.\n\nMore cuts to health care programs could come next year, as they are among the biggest expense in the state budget. The governor in past years had rejected calls to raise taxes to fix budget problems. Lawmakers have until June to pass a balanced budget.\n\n\"While we're still updating and refining our forecasts and projections for the Governor's January budget, the LAO has again highlighted the challenges that we've underscored throughout the year - federal uncertainty, market volatility, and continued growth in both cost and caseload for major state programs,\" H.D. Palmer, a spokesperson for the California Department of Finance, said in a statement.\n\nCalifornia will likely see even a bigger deficit, up to $35 billion, the following year, the LAO report said.\n\nLegislative Republicans said the budget challenges are a result of poor spending decisions.\n\n\"The state's structural deficit continues to grow because of the majority party's unstoppable spending problems,\" Republican state Sen. Roger Niello said in a statement.\n\nLawmakers passed a $321 billion spending plan last year following an agreement between Newsom and Democratic leaders.\n\nSenate President pro Tempore Monique Limón, a Democrat, said lawmakers will work with the governor to craft \"a responsible state budget that protects core programs, including education, childcare, safety net, health care, and public safety.\"",

    "body": "With help from Anne C. Mulkern\n\nTHE CLIMATE OF THE RACE: Newly minted gubernatorial candidate Tom Steyer and his pet issue of climate change face the same challenge: connecting with voters.\n\nThe hedge-funder turned climate advocate, investor and erstwhile presidential candidate entered the race to succeed Gov. Gavin Newsom on Wednesday via a two-minute campaign video in which he pledged to tackle the state's high cost of living by building record numbers of affordable homes and breaking up monopolistic electric utility companies.\n\nClimate didn't rate a mention. That's by design, in this age of affordability, political consultants say.\n\n\"Insiders know he's spent a lot of effort on climate, but he's going to largely be able to define himself however he wants it,\" said Rob Stutzman, a Sacramento-based Republican consultant.\n\nSteyer has a long climate resume, from co-chairing the opposition campaign in 2010 that defeated Prop 23, an oil industry attempt to repeal California's signature climate law, to launching NextGen Climate Action Committee, an advocacy group focused on supporting climate candidates.\n\n\"What do we want to incentivize in this world? What we want is the cheapest, cleanest, most ubiquitous energy that we can have,\" Steyer said last month at an event alongside California Air Resources Board Chair Lauren Sanchez.\n\nSteyer's challenge will be to build name recognition while also rebranding himself a populist critic of the wealthy and a foil to President Donald Trump. His Prop. 50 ads last month began to do that with their cartoonish depiction of the president -- and his focus now on criticizing utilities is tapping into a similar vein of targeting a common source of frustration for Californians.\n\n\"In the video I saw today, I saw a lot about affordability and corporations not paying their fair share, and not necessarily a whole lot about climate,\" Stutzman said. \"Does this affect the climate discussion? I think that'll be up to him.\"\n\nOther candidates are already taking their shots.\n\n\"A billionaire in our race claims he'll fight the very industries he got rich helping grow -- fossil fuel companies, tobacco, and private immigration detention facilities -- at great cost to Californians. I call bullshit,\" candidate Katie Porter posted on X.\n\nRepublican contender Chad Bianco, meanwhile, was already using Steyer's environmental record against him by linking him to high gas prices.\n\nThe early attacks on both flanks illustrate the treacherous path Steyer will have to navigate to reach the governor's mansion from his low-single-digit poll position at a time when affordability is hot -- and climate is not.\n\nPublic Policy Institute of California polling from October found that 26 percent of likely voters think that cost of living, the economy and inflation are the most important issues facing Californians today. Just two percent think the environment, pollution and global warming deserve the top spot.\n\nEnvironmentalists are excited but also holding off endorsing, hoping for a robust debate.\n\n\"I think you have basically a field where everyone's still trying to figure out what their lane could look like,\" said California Environmental Voters executive director Mike Young.\n\n\"I would love to see a debate between him and Katie Porter on the one hand, and Antonio Villaraigosa and Xavier Becerra on the other side, talking about taking fossil fuel money,\" said said RL Miller, the president and founder of Climate Hawks Vote, which maintains a list of candidates who've pledged not to accept money from oil and gas companies. \"I would love to see a debate about how we can bring down utility prices.\" -- AN, CvK, NB\n\nDid someone forward you this newsletter? Sign up here!\n\nEJAC-TED: An environmental justice adviser to the California Air Resources Board resigned in protest on Tuesday after a dust-up that has only further strained the relationship between the powerful regulator and the left flank of the environmental movement.\n\nCatherine Garoupa, who was co-chair of the Environmental Justice Advisory Committee, said in a resignation letter that CARB was dismissing science \"at the expense of low income communities and communities of color,\" as Anne C. Mulkern reports for POLITICO's E&E News. Garoupa had previously criticized a tense interaction with a CARB staffer on an earlier webinar, which she called disrespectful and said caused a \"chilling effect.\"\n\nCARB spokesperson Lindsay Buckley told POLITICO the agency had requested Attorney General Rob Bonta's office review the allegations, which Buckley said it found were unsubstantiated.\n\nThe tussle comes in a moment of transition for the advisory group, which has no further meetings scheduled until the current members' terms expire in March 2026. It also comes after a bruising year for environmental justice groups in the state Legislature, which saw lawmakers and Newsom expand oil drilling in Kern County and extend the state's signature emissions trading program without some of the major changes they wanted.\n\nNow, CARB is set to start its all-important emissions trading rulemaking by the end of the year, with a final vote next spring, without any scheduled EJAC meetings. -- CvK, ACM\n\nSPILLING THE TEA: What do firearms, explosives and kombucha have in common? They're all forbidden at California's last remaining nuclear power plant.\n\nPOLITICO visited the Diablo Canyon Power Plant on Monday and had to know more about the kombucha interdiction.\n\nIf someone brings a bottle in, \"we've got a beverage with alcohol, and that becomes a regulatory violation,\" said Maureen Zawalick, Pacific Gas & Electric's chief risk officer.\n\nShe explained that the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission has strict regulations prohibiting alcohol on site -- including kombucha, although it only has trace amounts.\n\nIn 2017, the facility launched an investigation to identify the culprit who left a bottle of kombucha in a breakroom refrigerator. A similar situation happened at the Millstone Nuclear Power Plant, in Connecticut, in 2018, after which the NRC lightened its reporting requirements. But the beverage remains a no-no on site -- and it's not the only culinary deprivation plant workers experience.\n\nDrug tests can get tripped for opiates if a person has been eating poppy seeds, even though they're not an intoxicant. For Zawalick, that meant saying goodbye to everything bagels, coated with the risky seeds, during her three-decade nuclear career.\n\n\"I've had a lot of salmon and lox and capers on a cracker,\" she said.\n\nSnacks aside, the plant is currently at the center of another brewing battle.\n\nThe California Coastal Commission put off a vote earlier this month on a key approval Diablo Canyon needs to continue operating through 2030 over concerns that it wouldn't require PG&E to conserve enough land to make up for the plant's damage to marine life.\n\nCommissioner Matt O'Malley argued during the meeting that the commission should conserve 12,000 acres of land around the plant, rather than the 1,100 acres that PG&E had agreed on.\n\n\"I don't think that's a nexus of proportionality for five years of operations,\" Zawalick said regarding the 12,000-acre proposal, adding that she felt that the staff proposal was \"appropriate mitigation.\" PG&E is continuing to have conversations with Coastal Commission staff on the topic, according to Zawalick.\n\nThe agency expects to revisit the issue at its December meeting, according to Coastal Commission spokesperson Joshua Smith. -- NB\n\nON FIRE IN DC: California's fire tech is marching on its Washington D.C. influence campaign with a new bipartisan bill proposal in Congress.\n\nRep. Dave Min (D-Calif.) is part of the bipartisan group that introduced the legislation on Wednesday, along with Rep. Gabe Evans (R-Colo.) and Sens. Ben Ray Lujan (D-N.M.) and Dan Sullivan (R-Ark.). The new bill, named the \"Regional Leadership in Wildland Fire Research Act of 2025,\" would direct federal agencies to establish eight wildfire research centers at colleges and universities.\n\nAmong the supporters: the University of California. Bipartisan support gives the bill better odds, but it may not be enough: A broader bipartisan bill that would make it easier for wildfire prevention projects, the Fix our Forests Act, has yet to receive a full Senate vote. -- CvK\n\nCHARGERS IN COURT: An environmental group on Wednesday sued Shasta County, Compton and Shafter over enforcement of state laws to speed up local electric vehicle charger permitting.\n\nCoalition for Clean Air is requesting court orders to force local officials to adopt state-mandated streamlining ordinances and permitting checklists for applicants.\n\n\"For years, state law has required cities and counties to make it fast and easy to build EV charging stations, but far too many local governments have ignored this mandate,\" Joseph Lyou, the group's president and CEO, said in a statement.\n\nCompton, Shafter and Shasta County are among the 110 local governments that have taken no action to streamline EV charger permitting, data published by the Governor's Office of Business and Economic Development shows. CCA is already warning that more lawsuits are likely to follow.\n\nThe move comes as California lags behind its public charger goals. The state has just over 200,000 public and shared private electric vehicle chargers, according to its most recent data, and is not on pace to reach the one million figure it estimates is needed by 2030 to support 7 million EVs on the road. -- AN\n\nNO VOTE: Remember that controversial vote on undergrounding powerlines to reduce wildfire risk that the California Public Utilities Commission was gearing up to take tomorrow? Commissioner Matthew Baker on Wednesday delayed the decision to the CPUC's Dec. 4 meeting.\n\nHow come? Regular readers, let's all say it together: \"For further review,\" said CPUC spokesperson Terrie Prosper. -- NB\n\n-- Catch Camille talking about Newsom's climate calculations on KQED.\n\n-- The Environmental Defense Fund is pushing CARB to adopt a more ambitious pollution cap in its upcoming rewrite of its cap-and-invest program.\n\n-- The first home has been rebuilt after the Los Angeles wildfires.

    "title": "Tom Steyer is running for California governor as a populist billionaire",
    "body": "Billionaire businessman and activist Tom Steyer, who once self-financed an unsuccessful White House campaign and spent his own money advocating for President Donald Trump's impeachment, has launched his bid for California governor as a Democrat.\n\nThe 68-year-old's tremendous wealth immediately makes him a notable contender in a free-for-all that includes more than a half-dozen Democrats and two Republicans competing in an all-party June primary, with the top two vote-getters advancing to a November general election to succeed term-limited Gov. Gavin Newsom.\n\nSteyer announced his candidacy with a pledge to improve economic conditions and by framing his political record as friendly to consumers, working-class voters and the environment.\n\n\"Californians deserve a life they can afford,\" he said in a video released Wednesday morning. \"But the Californians who make this state run are being run over by the cost of living.\"\n\nThe approach puts Steyer on a collision course with other candidates like progressive Congresswoman Katie Porter, former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and former U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra.\n\nAt one time, Porter was viewed as a top contender but the contest is now seen as wide open. Steyer's personal fortune could give him an advantage in reaching voters through television and digital advertising in an expansive state with nearly 40 million people and multiple media markets. Still, tremendous wealth has not necessarily translated to statewide electoral success in California: Carly Fiorina, a former Hewlett-Packard CEO, could not unseat Democratic U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer in their 2010 matchup. Meg Whitman, a onetime CEO of eBay, spent more than $100 million of her own money in a losing governor's campaign that same year.\n\nSteyer's money quickly became a target for rivals in the race.\n\n\"Tom Steyer tried to buy the presidency -- and he failed. The California governorship is not going to be his consolation prize,\" said Democrat Betty Yee, a former state controller.\n\nSteyer nodded to his wealth Wednesday, noting his business enterprises made \"billions of dollars.\" But he also sounded populist tones.\n\n\"The richest people in America think that they earned everything themselves,\" he said, before dismissing that notion with an expletive for bovine excrement. \"That's so ridiculous.\"\n\nSteyer said he would \"make corporations pay their fair share again,\" and his campaign cited his previous work on ballot initiatives with similar aims. Steyer was a leading advocate for a 2012 ballot initiative that made it harder for corporations to avoid certain taxes. The new revenue was steered to energy improvements in the state's public schools.\n\nIn other referendum work, Steyer helped lead the 2016 campaign that yielded a $2 per-pack tax hike on tobacco products. The money was steered to state health care programs, including tobacco-prevention efforts. And Steyer was a top opponent of a 2010 ballot initiative that would have rolled back California's clean air and climate law, which has been viewed as a national standard on climate policy.\n\nIn another development Wednesday, Villaraigosa launched a digital ad spotlighting Becerra's connection to an unfolding Sacramento scandal as the two skirmish over votes, including those of Latinos. Prosecutors allege longtime Becerra aide Sean McCluskie was at the center of a plan that siphoned money from one of Becerra's dormant state campaign accounts to pad his salary after he accepted a job as Becerra's chief of staff in Washington. Becerra is not implicated in the indictment but the ad attempts to raise doubts about his judgment and features clips from a TV interview in which Becerra said he knew payments were being made from his account but didn't know they were being improperly used.\n\nSteyer spent millions of his own money touring the country and pushing for Trump's impeachment during the Republican president's first term. He then ran for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, spending more than $200 million of his fortune and receiving no pledged delegates. After distant finishes in the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary, Steyer doubled-down with an expensive push in South Carolina, only to finish a distant third behind eventual nominee and President Joe Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. Steyer then ended his presidential bid, and he financially supported Biden's reelection in 2024 before the Democrat bowed out in favor of then-Vice President Kamala Harris, another Californian.\n\nSteyer's latest campaign comes amid some Democrats questioning Porter's candidacy after her combative exchanges with a TV journalist spread online in October. He has long been mentioned, along with Harris and U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla, as a potential heavyweight candidate who could join the field.\n\nHarris, who is on a national tour promoting her 2024 campaign memoir, has said consistently that she has no plans to run -- suggesting instead that any future campaign would be for the presidency.\n\n\"I will be voting,\" she told The Associated Press on Oct. 17 when asked about entering the governor's race. Asked whether she was satisfied with the field as Porter faced her most intense criticism, Harris said only that she wanted Democrats to have \"the best and the brightest running and winning\" and that she was \"not actively involved.\"",

Gavin Newsom to safeguard some of the progressive policies that have defined his tenure as he considers a presidential run.\n\nThe nonpartisan Legislative Analyst's Office projected the shortfall in a report released Wednesday. It would mark the state's fourth deficit in a row.

His second and final term as governor ends in January 2027, and this year's budget will be his last say on how money is spent in the nation's most populous state. Governors in California are limited to two terms.\n\nNew federal policies on tariffs and ongoing high borrowing costs are leading to weaker corporate and sales tax trends and sluggish job growth, Legislative Analyst Gabriel Petek said at a briefing Wednesday.\n\nThe only bright spot has come almost exclusively from strong investments in artificial intelligence, allowing the state to collect billions more in personal income tax than projected. But most of those revenue gains must go toward schools and paying down state debt. The report also warns that the AI investments might not be sustainable in the long run.\n\n\"It's risky to assume that these trends will just continue unabated,\" Petek said. He added: \"The budget condition right now has become relative weak.\"\n\nFor Newsom, how he balances the budget without abandoning Democrats' priority programs will help shape his national image as he mulls a presidential run.\n\nHe already had to roll back a signature health care program last year in the face of a $12 billion deficit, dealing a major blow to state Democrats' priority of providing universal health care. The ambitious state-funded program started in 2024 to provide free health care to immigrants living in California regardless of their legal status. Those without legal status will no longer be eligible to enroll in the program starting next year, and some will have to start paying a premium in 2027.\n\nState Democratic leaders in the past few years have avoided some of the deepest cuts to their priorities by borrowing from special funds and delaying payments to plug the budget hole.

Palmer, a spokesperson for the California Department of Finance, said in a statement.\n\nCalifornia will likely see even a bigger deficit, up to $35 billion, the following year, the LAO report said.\n\nLegislative Republicans said the budget challenges are a result of poor spending decisions.\n\n\"The state's structural deficit continues to grow because of the majority party's unstoppable spending problems,\" Republican state Sen. Roger Niello said in a statement.\n\nLawmakers passed a $321 billion spending plan last year following an agreement between Newsom and Democratic leaders.\n\nSenate President pro Tempore Monique Limón, a Democrat, said lawmakers will work with the governor to craft \"a responsible state budget that protects core programs, including education, childcare, safety net, health care, and public safety.\"",

    "title": "Jerry's jeremiad: A wild dissent roils Texas redistricting debate",
    "body": "Smith, on the losing end of that 2-1 ruling, attacked the plaintiffs as tools of left-wing donors George and Alex Soros, who featured at least 17 times in the ruling. (\"George and Alex Soros have their hands all over this.\") Smith swiped at Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom (\"The main winners from Judge Brown's opinion are George Soros and Gavin Newsom.\") And Smith went after the plaintiffs' lawyers and advocates in intensely personal ways.\n\n\"That tells you all that you need to know -- this is about partisan politics, plain and simple,\" Smith wrote.\n\nBut Smith, a Reagan appointee, saved his most intense disdain for a fellow jurist, U.S. District Judge Jeffrey Brown, a Galveston-based Trump appointee who authored Tuesday's ruling scrapping the new Texas map that gave Republicans a five-seat pickup opportunity.\n\nThe redistricting ruling is headed for the Supreme Court, which is expected to decide quickly whether to allow it to remain in effect or reinstate Texas' new, more Republican-friendly map. While the justices often rely on appellate dissents in considering how to deal with cases, Brown's intense focus on the conduct of his judicial colleague could obscure some of his legal and factual complaints about the ruling, some experts said.\n\nSmith's umbrage appeared to stem from the speed with which Brown issued the ruling, a move Brown emphasized was intended to allow Texas leaders to return to the state's earlier congressional boundaries before a Dec. 8 deadline for candidates to declare their bids for Congress.\n\n\"This outrage speaks for itself,\" Smith wrote. Only it didn't, because Smith kept going.\n\nWhile dissenting judges typically refer obliquely to the \"majority\" opinion, Smith's relentlessly personal and withering opinion using Brown's name more than 360 times, often accompanied by colorful insults.\n\nSmith lit into Brown as an \"unskilled magician\" who \"prefers living in fantasyland.\" Smith said Brown committed \"pernicious judicial misbehavior\" by racing to issue his opinion. Smith also slammed Brown as \"no stranger to inconsistency,\" called him \"wrong on multiple levels\" and accused him of handing \"Soros a victory at the expense of the People of Texas and the Rule of Law.\"\n\n\"Whether Judge Brown likes it, gravity exists,\" Smith wrote.\n\nAlthough judges typically couch their deliberations in a veil of secrecy, Smith revealed them in great detail, even quoting from the text of email exchanges with Brown as the ruling was being prepared.\n\nLest anyone be confused, Smith rolled out the phrase, \"I dissent\" some 16 times.\n\nSmith also concluded his opinion ominously. \"Darkness descends on the Rule of Law. A bumpy night, indeed,\" he wrote.\n\nBrown did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe fellow district judge who signed on to Brown's opinion, El Paso-based Obama appointee David Guaderrama, escaped largely unscathed from Smith's withering assault. Smith mentions Guaderrama by name only once and alludes to him briefly at one other point.\n\nThe rupture between Smith and Brown could be due in part to the fact that the men don't typically work together. Under a special legal provision passed by Congress, certain redistricting cases go to a three-judge panel instead of a single district court judge. Such panels are comprised of two district judges and one appeals court judge, with appeals of their rulings going directly to the Supreme Court.",

    "title": "What happens to California's redistricting after Texas' congressional maps were struck down in court?",
    "body": "Gov. Gavin Newsom said California's redistricting was in response to Texas' rare mid-decade redistricting push. That doesn't mean California is turning back after a federal court in Texas blocked the state's recently redrawn congressional map from going into effect for the 2026 midterm elections.\n\nTuesday's court ruling came weeks after California voters formally approved a ballot measure that was introduced to counteract Texas' redistricting -- but lawmakers removed the trigger language from the ballot measure. Without the trigger language, changes to California's districts are unlikely.\n\n\"Donald Trump and Greg Abbott played with fire, got burned and democracy won,\" Newsom wrote on X Tuesday following the court ruling. \"This ruling is a win for Texas, and for every American who fights for free and fair elections.\"\n\nPaul Mitchell, whose firm was hired to draw California's congressional districts, posted on social media that the maps will be staying in place.\n\n\"The trigger language was removed in the legislative process as it was clear that TX was redistricting. So, even if their map is invalidated/postponed, the Prop 50 maps stay in place,\" Mitchell wrote.\n\nEarlier this year, Texas lawmakers redrew their congressional maps in a rare mid-decade redistricting effort, kicked off after President Trump pushed for new congressional district boundaries that could help secure five Republican-friendly seats.\n\nThe move set off a redistricting battle across the U.S., with Newsom -- - a potential 2028 presidential candidate -- leading an effort to neutralize potential Republican gains in Texas by redrawing California's own congressional lines to net up to five seats for Democrats.\n\nIn August, California lawmakers approved several bills to redraw the state's congressional map to potentially make five Republican-held congressional districts more favorable to Democrats. Because the measures required changes to the state's constitution, they had to be put before voters in a special election.\n\nEarlier this month, California voters overwhelmingly approved Proposition 50, setting the stage for newly-drawn congressional maps for the 2026 midterms.\n\nWhen California state lawmakers had initially introduced their redistricting legislation, it included a trigger clause under which California would only redraw its congressional map in response to a similar move by a Republican state.\n\nUnder that trigger language, California's redistricting map would \"become operative only if Texas, Florida, or another state adopts a new congressional district map that takes effect after Aug. 1, 2025, and before Jan. 1, 2031, and such redistricting is not required by a federal court order.\"\n\nHowever, the trigger clause was removed just before California lawmakers voted on the redistricting bills. Without that trigger language, as it stands now, the Texas ruling does not impact California's redrawn map.\n\nDuring an August press conference, Newsom was asked if California would move forward with Proposition 50 even if a court were to strike down Texas' maps.\n\n\"We're moving forward,\" Newsom responded. \"Texas moved forward. Texas acted. Texas is moving forward. You're suggesting, people are suggesting. Texas is not going to move forward because of what we just did? Come on.\"\n\nThe Trump administration has sued California over its new congressional lines. A hearing is scheduled for Dec 3.\n\nMeanwhile, the Trump administration denounced the ruling striking down Texas' maps. Texas on Tuesday afternoon appealed the ruling striking down its maps to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\n\"We strongly disagree with today's district court ruling on Texas's redistricting map - Texas's map was drawn the right way for the right reasons,\" Attorney General Pam Bondi wrote on X. \"We look forward to Texas's victory at the Supreme Court.\"\n\nAccording to Justin Levitt, a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles, the ruling invalidating Texas maps would not have an effect on California's redistricting efforts given the facts that were considered by the court.\n\n\"Texas maps were struck down by the court based on how Texas actually drew the lines, and that has very little to do with how California drew their lines,\" Levitt told CBS News.\n\nIn the Texas ruling, in a 2-1 decision, federal judges found \"substantial evidence\" that \"Texas racially gerrymandered the 2025 map.\" The court considered a letter that the Justice Department sent to Texas lawmakers in July stating the state's 2021 map was \"unconstitutional\" because it included four congressional districts where no ethnic group had an outright majority, concluding that the state must therefore dismantle and redraw its lines.\n\nThe court found this to be a \"legally incoherent assertion.\"\n\n\"California didn't do anything like that,\" Levitt said. \"California drew districts overwhelmingly for partisan reasons and there's actually nothing that the litigants in California have pointed to that indicates that California focused predominantly or excessively based on race.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court is expected to weigh in on a dispute over Louisiana's congressional map and whether race can be used as a factor when drawing districts. In October, justices appeared poised to weaken a key provision, Section 2, of the Voting Rights Act that has allowed the consideration of race when drawing districts, and has been used to ensure minority voters have the opportunity to elect their preferred candidates.\n\nThis could lead to more redistricting efforts as states eliminate race as a factor for their standing congressional voting lines.\n\n\"It is terribly disturbing that this is where we are at,\" Texas Democratic state Rep. Ramon Romero told CBS News. \"A point where communities that have been so grossly underrepresented for basically our entirety of the history of our country and now that there's growth in opportunity, there's growth in education, there's growth in representation, those wealthy billionaires that are manipulating our country for their benefit have won at the expense of so many families and people of color.\"\n\nRomero was among the Texas lawmakers who broke quorum in August by leaving the state in attempts to block the GOP-backed congressional maps. Though he says today's ruling was a victory for Democrats, much remains to be determined after the Supreme Court weighs in.\n\nThe timing of a Supreme Court decision is unknown, but the clock is ticking for Texas. Congressional candidates have until Dec. 8 to file to run for next year's midterm election and appear on the primary ballot set for March.",

    "body": "But it's not looking like such a great idea right now. After moving five Democratic-held seats in Texas into the GOP column, Trump's redistricting campaign has suffered setback after setback as Democrats responded in kind, and some Republican-led states refused Trump's pressure campaign.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, got voters to approve a ballot initiative that counters Texas' gerrymander by adding five Democratic-leaning seats in the state. Efforts to pressure GOP legislatures to redraw maps in states like Indiana and Kansas ran aground while Virginia Democrats announced their own plan to redraw their state's map -- potentially flipping up to four seats from the GOP. Then a state court in Utah required the state to draw one safe Democratic seat. And on Tuesday, a federal court struck down Texas' new map as a racial gerrymander.",

    "title": "What happens to California's redistricting after Texas' congressional maps were struck down in court?",
    "body": "Gov. Gavin Newsom said California's redistricting was in response to Texas' rare mid-decade redistricting push. That doesn't mean California is turning back after a federal court in Texas blocked the state's recently redrawn congressional map from going into effect for the 2026 midterm elections.\n\nTuesday's court ruling came weeks after California voters formally approved a ballot measure that was introduced to counteract Texas' redistricting -- but lawmakers removed the trigger language from the ballot measure. Without the trigger language, changes to California's districts are unlikely.\n\n\"Donald Trump and Greg Abbott played with fire, got burned and democracy won,\" Newsom wrote on X Tuesday following the court ruling. \"This ruling is a win for Texas, and for every American who fights for free and fair elections.\"\n\nPaul Mitchell, whose firm was hired to draw California's congressional districts, posted on social media that the maps will be staying in place.\n\n\"The trigger language was removed in the legislative process as it was clear that TX was redistricting. So, even if their map is invalidated/postponed, the Prop 50 maps stay in place,\" Mitchell wrote.\n\nEarlier this year, Texas lawmakers redrew their congressional maps in a rare mid-decade redistricting effort, kicked off after President Trump pushed for new congressional district boundaries that could help secure five Republican-friendly seats.\n\nThe move set off a redistricting battle across the U.S., with Newsom -- - a potential 2028 presidential candidate -- leading an effort to neutralize potential Republican gains in Texas by redrawing California's own congressional lines to net up to five seats for Democrats.\n\nIn August, California lawmakers approved several bills to redraw the state's congressional map to potentially make five Republican-held congressional districts more favorable to Democrats. Because the measures required changes to the state's constitution, they had to be put before voters in a special election.\n\nEarlier this month, California voters overwhelmingly approved Proposition 50, setting the stage for newly-drawn congressional maps for the 2026 midterms.\n\nWhen California state lawmakers had initially introduced their redistricting legislation, it included a trigger clause under which California would only redraw its congressional map in response to a similar move by a Republican state.\n\nUnder that trigger language, California's redistricting map would \"become operative only if Texas, Florida, or another state adopts a new congressional district map that takes effect after Aug. 1, 2025, and before Jan. 1, 2031, and such redistricting is not required by a federal court order.\"\n\nHowever, the trigger clause was removed just before California lawmakers voted on the redistricting bills. Without that trigger language, as it stands now, the Texas ruling does not impact California's redrawn map.\n\nDuring an August press conference, Newsom was asked if California would move forward with Proposition 50 even if a court were to strike down Texas' maps.\n\n\"We're moving forward,\" Newsom responded. \"Texas moved forward. Texas acted. Texas is moving forward. You're suggesting, people are suggesting. Texas is not going to move forward because of what we just did? Come on.\"\n\nThe Trump administration has sued California over its new congressional lines. A hearing is scheduled for Dec 3.\n\nMeanwhile, the Trump administration denounced the ruling striking down Texas' maps. Texas on Tuesday afternoon appealed the ruling striking down its maps to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\n\"We strongly disagree with today's district court ruling on Texas's redistricting map - Texas's map was drawn the right way for the right reasons,\" Attorney General Pam Bondi wrote on X. \"We look forward to Texas's victory at the Supreme Court.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court is expected to weigh in on a dispute over Louisiana's congressional map and whether race can be used as a factor when drawing districts. In October, justices appeared poised to weaken a key provision, Section 2, of the Voting Rights Act that has allowed the consideration of race when drawing districts, and has been used to ensure minority voters have the opportunity to elect their preferred candidates.\n\nThis could lead to more redistricting efforts as states eliminate race as a factor for their standing congressional voting lines.\n\n\"It is terribly disturbing that this is where we are at,\" Texas Democratic state Rep. Ramon Romero told CBS News. \"A point where communities that have been so grossly underrepresented for basically our entirety of the history of our country and now that there's growth in opportunity, there's growth in education, there's growth in representation, those wealthy billionaires that are manipulating our country for their benefit have won at the expense of so many families and people of color.\"\n\nRomero was among the Texas lawmakers who broke quorum in August by leaving the state in attempts to block the GOP-backed congressional maps. Though he says today's ruling was a victory for Democrats, much remains to be determined after the Supreme Court weighs in.\n\nThe timing of a Supreme Court decision is unknown, but the clock is ticking for Texas. Congressional candidates have until Dec. 8 to file to run for next year's midterm election and appear on the primary ballot set for March.",

    "body": "This story was originally published on Manufacturing Dive. To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily Manufacturing Dive newsletter.\n\nDive Brief:\n\n* California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced Monday that the Office of Business and Economic Development awarded $99.9 million in tax credits to nine companies that plan to establish or expand manufacturing operations in the state.\n\n* The tax incentives, dubbed CalCompetes, will bring in more than $370 million in investments to California, according to the press release.\n\n* The tax credits will also support an estimated 2,752 jobs, with an average annual salary of $139,000.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nThe CalCompetes tax incentive was established in 2013 to help businesses grow and stay in the state. Since the program's launch, California has awarded tax credits to more than 1,200 companies and created about 161,000 jobs, according to the Governor's Office of Business and Economic Development.\n\nThe latest round of manufacturing awardees involves various sectors including aerospace, wastewater treatment, data center infrastructure and clothing design, per the release.\n\n9 manufacturers received $99.9M in CalCompetes tax credits\n\nProject investments each company pledges to spend and where, the number of jobs it'll create and the tax incentives they would receive.\n\nThe state has approximately $308 million in CalCompetes tax credits available and the Governor's Office of Business and Economic Development will accept applications from Jan. 5 to Jan. 26, 2026, according to a June 30 notice. Later in the year, the state agency will have $306.6 million available plus any remaining unallocated amounts, and will accept applications from March 2 to March 16, 2026.\n\nThe tax credits also support Newsom's 10-year plan for economic growth, which he released in February. Titled \"California Jobs First Economic Blueprint,\" the plan entails nine state agencies taking action to streamline the economic, business and workforce development to expedite job creation, including strengthening the state's manufacturing sector.\n\nAdditionally, Newsom's plan includes spending $52 million in creating apprenticeships focused on high-demand sectors such as advanced manufacturing, according to the Feb. 25 press release. Furthermore, the state will invest $16 million for pre-apprenticeship and apprenticeship programs that provide hands-on job training for people ages 16 to 24 who are not in school or working.\n\n\"Through programs like CalCompetes, we're attracting companies and helping them grow successfully in our state, creating good-paying jobs and opportunities for Californians,\" Newsom said in a statement Monday.",

    "body": "SACRAMENTO -- Current and former members of Gov. Gavin Newsom's administration were among the dozens of Sacramento insiders who received FBI letters in recent days notifying them that their phone calls, texts or other electronic communications had been intercepted as part of the federal corruption case tied to Dana Williamson and two other longtime Democratic operatives.\n\nThe notifications are routine in wiretap investigations once surveillance ends, but the letters set off a wave of panic across California's political power structure. The letters are signed by Sacramento Field Office Special Agent in Charge Siddhartha Patel and began arriving in mailboxes from Sacramento to Washington, D.C., last week, according to copies of the communications shared with The Times.\n\nThe legal notifications, under the terms of the 1968 Federal Wiretap Act, are sent out routinely to people whose private communications have been captured on federal wiretaps.\n\nA Newsom spokesperson said the governor's office is aware that a limited number of the letters were sent to current and former members of the administration. The spokesperson said that the letters were expected given federal law requires parties to be notified. Newsom's office said the governor did not receive a letter.\n\nNewsom's office said the governor is not involved in the case against Williamson. None of the charging documents released in the cases against the three aides mention Newsom.\n\nCopies of the letters, which were provided to The Times by individuals who asked to remain anonymous, indicate the period of time the communications were intercepted ranged from May 2024 to the end of July of 2024.\n\n\"This letter does not necessarily mean you were the target of the investigation or that any criminal action will be taken against you,\" Patel wrote in the letter. \"Rather, the purpose of this letter is to notify you that some of your communications may have been intercepted during the course of the investigation.\"\n\nWilliamson, known as one of California's toughest political insiders who previously worked as chief of staff to Newsom, was arrested last week on federal charges that allege she siphoned $225,000 out of 2026 gubernatorial hopeful Xavier Becerra's dormant state campaign account. She also was accused of spending $1 million on luxury handbags and high-flying travel and illegally declaring them as business expenses on her tax returns.\n\nAccording to the 23-count indictment, Williamson conspired with Becerra's former chief deputy in the California attorney general's office and ex-chief of staff Sean McCluskie, along with lobbyist Greg Campbell to bill Becerra's dormant campaign account for bogus consulting services.\n\nWilliamson has pleaded not guilty to the charges.\n\nThe highly publicized indictment against Williamson was sprinkled with references to her phone calls and text messages, indicating that federal investigators were likely relying on wiretapping. But the letters informing a wide swath of political insiders, from lobbyists to other operatives, is causing widespread anxiety across the Capitol.\n\nThe exact number of letters sent by the FBI is unknown, but political insiders say they've heard dozens of people have received one.\n\n\"It sends a chill up your spine, and everybody is worried,\" said Democratic consultant Steve Maviglio, who said he did not receive a letter. \"They can't remember what they said to whom, about what. It could be anything. I think most people think this could be the tip of the iceberg. They are very concerned about where all these rods might lead.\"",

    "body": "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.\n\nBillionaire Democratic mega donor Tom Steyer launched a California gubernatorial bid, throwing his hat into the ring to compete against the crowd of candidates vying to replace current Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom.\n\n\"The richest people in America think that they earned everything themselves,\" Steyer said at the beginning of a campaign video, before dropping a profanity.\n\n\"Bulls--- man. That's so ridiculous,\" he asserted.\n\n6 DEM-SUPPORTING BILLIONAIRES BIDEN DIDN'T MENTION WHILE CALLING OUT POLITICAL 'OLIGARCHY'\n\nSteyer, a former hedge fund manager, became a force in national politics last decade. He created NextGenAmerica, a grassroots advocacy organization that helped drive the youth vote in the 2018 elections, helping the Democrats win back the House of Representatives. And he became one of the ringleaders in the Democrats' first push to impeach President Donald Trump -- through his \"Need to Impeach\" movement.\n\nSteyer launched a 2020 presidential campaign and poured roughly $250 million of his own money into his White House bid. But after poor finishes in the early primaries and caucuses, he dropped out of the race.\n\nTRUMP ADMIN SUES OVER CALIFORNIA LAW BANNING ICE FROM WEARING FACE MASKS TO SHIELD IDENTITIES\n\nTrump criticized Steyer at the time, taking to social media to say, \"Tom Steyer who, other than Mini Mike Bloomberg, spent more dollars for NOTHING than any candidate in history, quit the race today proclaiming how thrilled he was to be a part of the ... Democrat Clown Show. Go away Tom and save whatever little money you have left!\"\n\nNewsom took office in early 2019, then survived a gubernatorial recall election in 2021 before going on to win a second term in 2022.\n\nHe is ineligible to serve a third term, as the state constitution stipulates, \"No Governor may serve more than 2 terms.\"\n\nLONGTIME NEWSOM CRITIC PUTS UN SUMMIT ON NOTICE IF DEM GOVERNOR IS ALLOWED TO SPEAK: 'CLIMATE HYPOCRISY'\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nFormer President Joe Biden-era Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra, former U.S. Rep. Katie Porter, former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco and former Fox News Channel host Steve Hilton are some of the other candidates running for California governor.",

    "title": "Politico Touts Gavin Newsom as 2028 'Frontrunner' but the Data Tells a Different Story",
    "body": "California Gov. Gavin Newsom is receiving heightened attention as a leading potential Democrat contender for the 2028 presidential race, but emerging party data suggests a disconnect between media enthusiasm and measurable impact on the ground.\n\nA Politico column by senior political writer Jonathan Martin portrayed California Gov. Gavin Newsom as the Democrat Party's early frontrunner for 2028, pointing to his clashes with President Trump, his use of social media to shape political narratives, and his decision to redraw California's congressional map as factors boosting his national profile.\n\nMartin's analysis highlighted Newsom's appeal across both traditional and modern Democrat coalitions. He drew comparisons to Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton, and Barack Obama -- candidates who rose as younger outsiders capable of running against Washington's status quo while still reassuring party insiders. Newsom's long-standing ties to national Democrat figures, including Bill Clinton and Nancy Pelosi, were cited as part of his political foundation, along with his early exposure to high-level networks, such as his participation in the inaugural Clinton Global Initiative.\n\nMartin also emphasized Newsom's refusal to be boxed into ideological categories, quoting the governor's description of himself as a \"hard-headed pragmatist\" who \"doesn't want to be labeled,\" and highlighting his stated goal of building a party that ranges \"from Manchin to Mamdani.\"\n\nYet while the profile emphasizes Newsom's rising stature, internal party research reveals a gap between perception and performance as a national messenger.\n\nHis political footing grew shakier this week after internal Democrat Party data revealed that Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), not the governor himself -- or even former President Barack Obama -- delivered the most effective message in support of Proposition 50, a key campaign Newsom was supposed to lead.\n\nNew research from Future Forward, the Democrat Party's top super PAC, shows that Ocasio-Cortez's ad promoting the newly enacted legislative map overhaul was the most effective pro-Prop 50 message tested. The group evaluated 16 different ads, and her direct-to-camera appeal -- including a version recorded in Spanish -- outperformed all others, increasing support for the measure by more than five percentage points.\n\nThe ad aired primarily on digital platforms and resonated by linking redistricting to everyday issues like health care, wages, and personal freedoms.\n\nApproved by California voters on November 4, Proposition 50 allows the Democrat-controlled legislature to redraw congressional districts mid-decade, overriding the independent redistricting commission established by voters in 2008. The new maps are projected to net Democrats up to five additional U.S. House seats.\n\nThe California Republican Party has announced a federal lawsuit against Proposition 50, alleging that the ballot measure violates the 14th and 15th Amendments by unconstitutionally gerrymandering congressional districts. At a press conference, State Assemblyman David Tangipa (R) declared himself the lead plaintiff, joined by California GOP Chairwoman Corrin Rankin and attorney Mike Columbo of the Dhillon Law Group. Eighteen California voters are also coplaintiffs in the suit.\n\nColumbo argued that the new map favors one racial group over others, thereby violating the 14th Amendment's equal protection clause and the 15th Amendment's protections against racial disenfranchisement. The lawsuit follows previous unsuccessful legal efforts by Republicans to block Democrat redistricting plans in the state. Newsom's office has predicted the lawsuit will fail.\n\nOcasio-Cortez's success in California is already fueling speculation about her future ambitions. According to Axios, her team is positioning her for a potential 2028 presidential or Senate run. Though she ranked behind Kamala Harris and Gavin Newsom in a recent Noble Predictive Insights poll, Ocasio-Cortez placed third among Democrat voters with 8 percent support, ahead of other potential candidates, including Pete Buttigieg. An Emerson College poll conducted earlier this year also showed Ocasio-Cortez trailing Vice President JD Vance by just three points in a national matchup, with Gavin Newsom likewise behind Vance by a similar margin, suggesting both remain competitive figures in early testing.",

After distant finishes in the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary, Steyer doubled-down with an expensive push in South Carolina, only to finish a distant third behind eventual nominee and President Joe Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. Steyer then ended his presidential bid, and he financially supported Biden's reelection in 2024 before the Democrat bowed out in favor of then-Vice President Kamala Harris, another Californian.\n\nSteyer's latest campaign comes amid some Democrats questioning Porter's candidacy after her combative exchanges with a TV journalist spread online in October. He has long been mentioned, along with Harris, as a potential heavyweight candidate who could join the field.\n\nHarris, who is on a national tour promoting her 2024 campaign memoir, has said consistently that she has no plans to run -- suggesting instead that any future campaign would be for the presidency.\n\n\"I will be voting,\" she told The Associated Press on Oct. 17 when asked about entering the governor's race. Asked whether she was satisfied with the field as Porter faced her most intense criticism, Harris said only that she wanted Democrats to have \"the best and the brightest running and winning\" and that she was \"not actively involved.\"",

    "body": "The Democrat joins an already-crowded field of candidates seeking to replace termed-out Gov. Gavin Newsom in next year's election\n\nBillionaire hedge fund founder-turned-environmental advocate Tom Steyer is running for governor of California - an announcement that comes as little to no surprise following his recent ad buys in support of Proposition 50 during the state's special election on redistricting.\n\nSpeculations that Steyer, who also ran for president in 2020, may be eyeing another foray into politics began swirling immediately after he announced plans to drop $12 million on ads to support California Democrats' mid-decade redistricting effort several weeks ago.\n\nThose speculations were confirmed Wednesday, Nov. 19, when Steyer, 68, formally announced his candidacy for governor.\n\nThe Democrat is a vocal critic of President Donald Trump. But in his campaign launch video, Steyer did not bring up national politics, instead focusing his message on solving California's affordability crisis.\n\n\"Californians who make this state run are being run over by the cost of living. We need to get back to basics. And that means making corporations pay their fair share again,\" Steyer said in the roughly two-minute video.\n\nOn the Democratic side, well-known candidates include former U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra, entrepreneur Stephen Cloobeck, former Rep. Katie Porter, Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond, former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and former state Controller Betty Yee.\n\nRepublican candidates include Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco and podcaster and former Fox News host Steve Hilton.\n\nEarlier this month, U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla announced he would not run for governor, joining former Vice President Kamala Harris who decided over the summer that she, too, would forgo a run for the state's highest office.\n\nHarris' and Padilla's decisions not to seek the governorship may have opened the door for other candidates.\n\nOther high-profile figures said to be considering a run include billionaire developer and former L.A. mayoral candidate Rick Caruso and U.S. Rep. Eric Swalwell, a Democrat from the Bay Area.\n\nAs for Steyer, his campaign told the Southern California News Group that the candidate - who has contributed tens of millions of dollars in the past to support or defeat certain state ballot measures - intends to contribute to his own campaign, though he hadn't decided how much.\n\nThe campaign also cited his role in working to defeat Proposition 23, a 2010 ballot initiative backed by oil companies seeking to roll back California's clean air and climate law.\n\nTwo years later, Steyer was the lead sponsor of Proposition 39, to close a corporate tax loophole for out-of-state companies, which in turn provided funding for energy-efficiency upgrades in schools.\n\nAnd in 2016, Steyer was a major backer of Proposition 56, which raised California's tobacco tax by $2 per pack and directed those funds to health care, Medi-Cal and tobacco-use prevention programs.\n\nSteyer, in his campaign video, pitched himself as a disruptor and a political outsider.\n\n\"We have a broken government. It's been bought by corporations, and my question is, 'Who do you think is going to change that?'\" Steyer said. \"Sacramento politicians are afraid to change up this system. I'm not. They're going to hate this.\"\n\n\"Bring it on,\" he added, staring directly into the camera.",

    "body": "'The Big Weekend Show' panel discuss California Gov. Gavin Newsom's victory lap after the state passed Prop 50, which is expected to add more Democratic representation.\n\nRep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Texas, suggested that he no longer plans to retire after federal judges ruled against a Republican-backed plan to alter Texas' congressional districts on Tuesday.\n\nDoggett had announced his qualified retirement earlier this year after Texas Republicans revealed a new redistricting map that would have pitted Doggett, 79, against fellow Texas Democratic Rep. Rep. Greg Casar, 36. Now that map's future is in jeopardy, however.\n\n\"To borrow from Mark Twain I can happily say that the reports of my death politically are greatly exaggerated,\" Doggett said in a video posted to social media.\n\n\"I'm very fortunate to have the opportunity to continue to represent the only town I've ever called home, at a time when democracy faces the greatest challenges that it has ever faced at any point in my lifetime,\" Doggett's statement continued. \"Thank you.\"\n\nABBOTT CLEARS FINAL REDISTRICTING HURDLE AS TEXAS SENATE PASSES NEW TRUMP-APPROVED MAP\n\nDoggett's newfound confidence comes after a federal panel of judges ruled 2-1 that the GOP redistricting map appeared to constitute an illegal, race-based gerrymander.\n\n\"The public perception of this case is that it's about politics,\" U.S. District Judge Jeffrey V. Brown, a Trump appointee, said in the majority opinion, joined by U.S. District Judge David Guaderrama, an Obama appointee.\n\n\"To be sure, politics played a role in drawing the 2025 map,\" the judges said. \"But it was much more than just politics. Substantial evidence shows that Texas racially gerrymandered the 2025 map.\"\n\nABBOTT SIGNS TEXAS REDISTRICTING MAP INTO LAW, SECURING MAJOR GOP VICTORY AHEAD OF 2026 MIDTERMS\n\nJudge Jerry Smith, a Reagan appointee, dissented without explanation.\n\nThe ruling is a significant blow to the Trump administration. It comes as President Donald Trump and his Republican allies have raced to pad the party's razor-thin House majority in the run-up to the 2026 midterm elections -- including by imploring some states to launch rare, mid-decade redistricting efforts.\n\nAs part of that push, legislators in Texas, Missouri, North Carolina, and Ohio have each redrawn their congressional maps.\n\nFEDERAL JUDGES BLOCK TEXAS FROM USING REDRAWN CONGRESSIONAL MAP\n\nOther states, including Florida and Kansas, are currently weighing similar efforts.\n\nTexas Attorney General Ken Paxton vowed on Tuesday to appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court for review. He said Texas would also be seeking an emergency stay from the high court that would temporarily stay the lower court's ruling.\n\nCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nGov. Greg Abbott sharply criticized the court's ruling Tuesday, saying in a statement that Texas legislators \"redrew our congressional maps to better reflect Texans' conservative voting preferences -- and for no other reason.\"\n\n\"Any claim that these maps are discriminatory is absurd and unsupported by the testimony offered during ten days of hearings,\" he added.",

    "title": "Can Ted Cruz Podcast His Way to the Presidency?",
    "body": "And perhaps even more shocking is that his show, \"Verdict with Ted Cruz,\" is the most popular podcast by far of any sitting politician in the United States. He's not exactly Joe Rogan or a Kelce brother. But with up to two million downloads a month and syndicated across iHeart radio, the podcast puts him on solid ground in his side hustle and well ahead of potential 2028 competitors; in July, he had almost three and half times as many downloads as Gavin Newsom, who has the second most popular podcast among elected officials.\n\nAt a moment when influencers increasingly have parasocial relationships with their fanbases and when the traditional media landscape is only growing more fractured, the podcast gives Cruz a much bigger platform than the average politician -- and a potential head start for a future presidential run.\n\nCruz started the Verdict podcast as a passion project in 2019 during President Donald Trump's first impeachment. It was a rare moment where constitutional law took center stage in the American political debate and there were not a lot of opportunities for Cruz to go deep into the weeds. Fox News is willing to air all sorts of unconventional things but it's not big on mentions of the 18th century impeachment trial of Warren Hastings by the British House of Lords.)\n\nEvery night, after the Senate had gaveled out for the day, Cruz would go to a nearby studio to debrief listeners on the events of the day and weigh in not just on the allegations against Trump but the finer points of law and the occasional Senate floor gossip. The podcast was an immediate hit.\n\n\"We started with zero listeners, and within a week, it skyrocketed to being the number one ranked podcast in the world,\" Cruz marveled in a recent interview. Since then, the frequency of the episodes has changed as well as the podcast's co-host, but the Texas senator's commitment to the medium has remained.\n\nAs a side hustle goes, it is a grind. Cruz and his co-host, conservative pundit Ben Ferguson, will sort through a list of a half dozen topics selected by Cruz's staff, pick their favorites, work out a rough running order and start recording.\n\nThe resulting conversation comes out the next morning to a dedicated fan base that hears Cruz in a relatively unvarnished setting, one far less focused on talking points than a cable news hit. It's not that the Texas senator is totally unleashed -- after all, he's still Ted Cruz -- but he gives a fuller sense of who he is, including with bad impersonations and long detailed digressions and explanations of his thoughts.\n\nAsked whether the podcast could help in another White House bid, a Cruz spokesperson shrugged off the question: \"Verdict with Ted Cruz was launched to give listeners a behind-the-scenes look at what's really happening in Washington, D.C. The podcast focuses on the most important issues affecting Americans that the mainstream media won't cover or will cover with bias. That is why the podcast was launched and is its number one purpose.\"\n\nHowever, 2028 is not that far away. And with Trump constitutionally ineligible to run again, the Texas Republican is already starting off with a massive email list, near universal name ID among the party faithful and a first place finish in Iowa to his name. In a political-media ecosystem facing deep disruption and campaigns going out of their way to court influencers, his podcast gives him another boost. After all, candidate Cruz doesn't need to do much to win the endorsement of podcaster Cruz.",

    "body": "Gov. Gavin Newsom has embraced the \"affordability\" talking point in the wake of socialist Zohran Mamdani's victory in the New York mayoral race -- yet California lags the nation on that front, with inflation well above the national average.\n\nInflation is the result of real-world policies that drive up costs -- and Golden State policies are toxic.\n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics collects consumer price index (CPI) measurements in 23 regions, reporting the info in staggered fashion every few months.\n\nOf the five worst regions, three are in California:\n\nSan Francisco-Oakland-Hayward had 2.5% inflation -- lower, but still above the US median.\n\nContrast those figures with inflation in red states like Texas: The Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington region had inflation of just 0.9%; Houston-Woodlands-Sugar Land was only slightly higher, at 1.1%.Inflation is a blue-state problem (New York-Newark-Jersey City suffered a 3.2% annual rate as of August) -- and especially a California problem.\n\nLocalized price hikes are the result of local factors: regulations that make housing more expensive; taxes that drive up gas prices; green energy mandates that raise utility bills; and state grants that spread cash without solving the problem of poverty -- where California is also first in the nation.\n\nMaking everything \"free\" or heavily subsidized doesn't solve the problem, but rather makes it worse:\n\nNewsom this year had to stop admitting illegal migrants into Medi-Cal, the state's Medicaid program, because it was driving the whole system toward insolvency.\n\nLiberal columnist Joe Garofoli, writing in the San Francisco Chronicle, warned that the Democrats' new focus on \"affordability\" could \"doom\" Newsom's presidential ambitions, since \"California is 13% more expensive than the country overall as of 2023.\"\n\nNewsom's only hope, he argued, is that \"Democratic voters starving for a leader\" overlook the gov's record in office and buy his \"promises about the future.\"\n\nBelatedly, state and local California officials are enacting laws that make it easier to build housing -- usually, high-rises near transit hubs. Even the feared Coastal Commission, under withering public criticism, is starting to relax its restrictions.\n\nBut that doesn't reduce the expense of \"green\" construction mandates or local transfer taxes. And dense development creates its own new costs.\n\nInflation is the result of high-tax, high-regulation policies the governor has championed. That's why California, the bluest of blue states, is losing more people than any other -- and why \"affordability\" looks like a losing issue for Newsom.",

    "body": "California Gov. Gavin Newsom roasted President Donald Trump as a \"piggy\" after the president went viral Tuesday for calling a female Bloomberg jouranlist \"piggy\" while she pressed him on his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein.\n\n\"Quiet, piggy,\" Newsom tweeted from his own X account on Tuesday. The governor's post was coupled with a photo of the president looking disgruntled as he tried to remove a right-fitting suit jacket.\n\nBut the governor and his team didn't stop there, as his press office continued the insults in a series of AI-created images and memes on their own X account.\n\n\"Piggies,\" the official account for Newsom's press office wrote in an X post, which was uploaded with a screenshot from a video of Trump hanging out with the late sex offender Epstein, whom he's been tied to in the Epstein files scandal.\n\nAnother tweet was an edited image of Trump's head attached to a pig's body.\n\nThe office went on to upload more \"quiet, piggy\" posts. Another one was an edited image of Trump with a pig head holding images of the ballroom that's being built where the White House's East Wing used to be. Others showed Trump scarfing down McDonald's meals, pasta and other food, and some mocked up Trump's body with added weight or pig features.\n\nNewsom's flame sesh came after Trump was widely condemned online for telling a female reporter to \"quiet, piggy\" in a video that went viral Monday.\n\nThe incident occurred while Trump was speaking with reporters aboard Air Force One last Friday. \"I know nothing about that,\" Trump said, when first asked what convicted sex trafficker Epstein meant when he wrote that the president \"knew about the girls\" in emails released by House Democrats last week. Trump went on to promise that Americans soon will find out everything Epstein knew about certain high-profile Democrats, including former President Bill Clinton.\n\n\"Jeffrey Epstein and I had a very bad relationship for many years,\" Trump added. A female Bloomberg reporter tried to follow that initial question up by asking Trump, if there was nothing incriminating in the government's Epstein Files, why he doesn't just personally order their release. However, Trump interrupted her.\n\nHe leaned in, pointed a finger at the journalist and said, \"Quiet. Quiet, piggy.\" The president then swiftly moved on to answer a question from CBS News reporter Jennifer Jacobs, who reported on the incident on her X account Friday.\n\nCheck out the exchange below and the Newsom's retaliatory X posts.",

    "body": "'The Big Weekend Show' panel discuss California Gov. Gavin Newsom's victory lap after the state passed Prop 50, which is expected to add more Democratic representation.\n\nPresident Donald Trump is amplifying his political targeting of Indiana Republicans who have been resisting calls from the president to move forward with congressional redistricting.\n\nTrump on Tuesday, for a third straight day, vowed to back primary challenges against state Republican lawmakers in the solidly red Midwestern state who didn't support his push to draw new maps in Indiana, which would create another GOP-leaning congressional district.\n\n\"A RINO State Senator, Rodric Bray, who doesn't care about keeping the Majority in the House in D.C., is the primary problem. Soon, he will have a Primary Problem, as will any other politician who supports him in this stupidity,\" Trump warned in a social media post.\n\nDespite pressure from Trump and his political team, Bray, the Republican leader in the state Senate, announced last week that there wasn't enough support in the chamber to move forward with redistricting. Indiana is the latest battlefield in the high-stakes redistricting showdown pitting Trump and Republicans versus Democrats to shape the 2026 midterm landscape in the fight for the House majority.\n\nINDIANA REPUBLICANS REJECT TRUMP-BACKED REDISTRICTING PUSH\n\nRepublicans currently control seven of Indiana's nine congressional districts, and any new map passed by the GOP supermajority in the legislature would likely shift the state's 1st Congressional District from blue-leaning to a red-leaning seat.\n\nTrump on Sunday lambasted Bray and another Republican state senator, calling for their ouster.\n\nThe president returned to social media a day later, charging, \"Because of these two politically correct type 'gentlemen,' and a few others, they could be depriving Republicans of a Majority in the House, A VERY BIG DEAL!\"\n\nRULING BY RED STATE JUDGE REDISTRICTING SETBACK FOR REPUBLICANS\n\nTrump is twisting elbows in his attempt to make Indiana the latest Republican-controlled state to change their congressional maps. The president has called state lawmakers and Vice President JD Vance visited the state earlier this autumn to discuss redistricting.\n\nAnd Fox News has confirmed that Trump has invited some of the Indiana Republicans who are holding out against redistricting to White House meetings in the coming days. The news was first reported by Politico.\n\nTrump, in his Sunday post, also took a jab at Republican Gov. Mike Braun of Indiana, arguing that the governor \"perhaps, is not working the way he should to get the necessary Votes.\"\n\nBraun on Monday wrote on social media that \"I just had a great call with President Trump! I told him I remain committed to standing with him on the critical issue of passing fair maps in Indiana to ensure the MAGA agenda is successful in Congress.\"\n\nAnd the governor claimed that \"the Indiana State Senate is hiding behind closed doors and refusing to even bring redistricting to a vote. Hoosiers deserve to know where their legislators stand and expect them to show up for work, not walk out and hide in the dark.\"\n\nTrump on Tuesday called Braun \"a good man,\" but warned he \"must produce on this, or he will be the only Governor, Republican or Democrat, who didn't.\"\n\nNEWSOM TAKES VICTORY LAP AFTER LANDSLIDE REDISTRICTING VICTORY IN CALIFORNIA\n\nThe push by the president in Indiana is part of a broad effort by Trump's political team and the GOP to pad the party's razor-thin House majority to keep control of the chamber in next year's midterms, when the party in power traditionally faces political headwinds and loses seats.\n\nTrump is aiming to prevent what happened during his first term in the White House when Democrats reclaimed the House majority in the 2018 midterm elections.\n\nTexas, Missouri, North Carolina, and Ohio have drawn new maps as part of the president's push. And Florida and Kansas are also mulling redrawing their maps.\n\n\"We must keep the Majority at all costs,\" Trump wrote Monday.\n\nBut on Tuesday, a three-judge federal panel delivered a blow to Trump and Republicans, by ruling that the state can't use the newly drawn map in next year's elections. Texas Republicans say they'll appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court.\n\nMeanwhile, Democrats are fighting back.\n\nCalifornia voters two weeks ago overwhelmingly passed Proposition 50, a ballot initiative which will temporarily sidetrack the left-leaning state's nonpartisan redistricting commission and return the power to draw the congressional maps to the Democrat-dominated legislature.\n\nThat is expected to result in five more Democratic-leaning congressional districts in California, which would counter the passage earlier this year in Texas of a new map that aims to create up to five right-leaning House seats.\n\nCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIllinois and Maryland, two blue states, and Virginia, where Democrats control the legislature, are also taking steps or seriously considering redistricting.\n\nAnd in a blow to Republicans, a Utah district judge last week rejected a congressional district map drawn up by the state's GOP-dominated legislature and instead approved an alternate that will create a Democratic-leaning district ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.",

FOX Business' Lauren Simonetti reports.\n\nPanera Bread is launching a multimillion-dollar initiative to overhaul its operations to boost traffic and reverse years of stagnant sales growth.\n\nPanera, one of many fast-casual restaurants contending with a challenging landscape, announced its transformation strategy on Tuesday, dubbed \"Panera RISE,\" which is focused on refreshing the menu, boosting its value proposition and customer experience by enhancing the look of its restaurants and expanding its network.\n\nThe company aims to use this strategy to help it reach more than $7 billion in systemwide sales by 2028, up from the $6 billion it currently brings in annually. In 2023, U.S. sales peaked at $6.5 billion, but its units and sales haven't substantially increased since, according to reports citing data from Technomic.\n\nEXPECT MORE RESTAURANT BANKRUPTCIES IN 2025, EXPERT SAYS\n\n\"As we transform our business, we are investing in four strategic pillars that put the guest at the very center of everything we do,\" Panera Bread CEO Paul Carbone said, adding that the company has already \"made considerable progress in strengthening\" its foundation.\n\nThe fast-casual chain specializing in salads, sandwiches and baked goods, had 2,239 bakery-cafes, company-owned and franchise locations across North America. Part of the turnaround includes building new locations and \"modernizing\" its current portfolio of restaurants \"to ensure consistent operational excellence across franchise and Panera company bakery-cafes,\" the company said. Panera didn't disclose where the new locations would open or what they would look like.\n\nTHE TGI FRIDAYS COMEBACK: FROM A MENU REVAMP TO NEW SOCIAL MEDIA STRATEGY\n\nThe company said its plan also includes elevating the company's food served throughout the day to \"incorporate abundant, flavorful and distinctive, high-quality ingredients.\" It also aims to enhance its bakery and beverage options. Panera will also promise to have a \"variety of price points\" so its menu remains affordable.\n\nCHILI'S SLIMMED-DOWN MENU IS WINNING, CEO SAYS\n\nThe company will also deploy more staffing into front-of-house service to enhance the experience for guests.\n\nPanera is the latest company to initiate a major turnaround as the industry contends with supply-chain disruptions and rising labor costs coupled with subdued traffic. Starbucks chief Brian Niccol announced a \"Back to Starbucks\" turnaround program shortly after taking the reins in 2024. The program is focused on driving traffic through operational improvements, store portfolio optimization and innovation.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nEarlier this year, TGI Fridays CEO Ray Blanchette told FOX Business that it was revamping its menu as part of its comeback from bankruptcy.\n\nSimilarly, Hooters is also trying to make a return after emerging from bankruptcy this year. Its new owners are updating its menu and changing the image that once defined the restaurant chain.\n\nMeanwhile, Dine Brands Global CEO John Peyton told FOX Business that the company is working to boost sales by strategically combining its morning-focused brand, IHOP, with its evening-centric one, Applebee's. The goal is to create a dual-branded model that allows it to capture and serve customers throughout every daypart - breakfast, lunch, dinner and late night - in a way that, as Peyton puts it, \"no other restaurant company can.\"",

    "title": "Newsom postures in Brazil as Californians face higher energy prices",
    "body": "We're not exactly shocked when politicians do political things, but Gov. Gavin Newsom didn't even try to hide the transparent goals of his recent trip to Brazil to attend a United Nations climate conference. Newsom is setting himself up for a likely run for the presidency, and has positioned himself as a foil to the GOP president. He's been successful so far, as his combative social-media taunts of Donald Trump and Proposition 50 redistricting victory make clear.\n\n\"As Donald Trump abandons America's allies and dismantles federal climate leadership, Governor Newsom is filling the void -- advancing California as a global climate leader through new partnerships with Brazil, Colombia and Chile,\" according to a statement on Newsom's official website. It's about highlighting national climate-change policy given that these partnerships with South American and other countries won't achieve much in actual policy terms\n\nHow could they lead to anything substantive? Politico pointed out the obvious: \"[A]s a governor, he has one glaring weakness: He can't sign treaties with other countries.\" Newsom's weeklong accomplishments -- \"signing voluntary agreements, joint statements and other pointedly nonbinding memorandums of understanding\" -- are much ado about very little.\n\nIn a recent statement, Newsom touted his \"historic climate action,\" but the specifics are meh (even if the photography of the governor in the Amazon rain forest was fetching). Newsom signed a memorandum of understanding with Chile to improve information exchanges regarding methane production. He signed a declaration of intent with Brazil to do something or other about biodiversity. He inked a deal with Nigeria to promote \"sustainable urban transportation\" and other nebulous goals.\n\nWe doubt anyone is paying too much attention to the details of these signings. The real interest comes in the back and forth between Newsom and Trump. The governor called the administration's pullback from the Paris climate accord \"an abomination.\" Meanwhile, a White House spokesperson slammed Newsom for flying \"all the way to Brazil to tout the Green New Scam, while Californians are paying some of the highest energy prices in the country.\"\n\nThe latter point touches on our main beef with California's climate agenda: It is piling costs on California consumers to achieve little practical gain. The state has the highest gas prices in the nation, driven by the state's climate-change policies that, in part, require a special fuels formulation that makes us an energy island and limits our ability to import gas from other states. We have among the highest electricity rates and a grid that's struggling to keep up with demand, especially with the growth in Artificial Intelligence-related data centers.\n\nAccording to a study this year from the Pacific Research Institute, \"California households will bear significant costs, estimated to be between $17,398 and $20,182 per household, to fund the state's transition to alternative energy sources between 2025 and 2050.\" The state's taxpayer-funded climate agenda is costly, too, with a price tag approaching $50 billion.\n\nOil refineries also are leaving the state. They are reluctant to invest in new capacity given California's policy of eliminating fossil-fuel industries. Even though Newsom has backtracked somewhat on that policy, he is going to have a hard time selling California's climate-change agenda to a national audience once Americans start focusing more on its costs and less on its rhetorical rebuke of Trump.",

In a landscape in which male politicians routinely lace their sentences with profanity like it's punctuation, the Los Angeles Times frames a story about alleged financial misconduct around a woman dropping f-bombs (\"Foul-mouthed, brash and savvy: What to know about ex-Newsom aide tangled in a corruption probe,\" Nov. 14).\n\nLet's be clear: If Dana Williamson were a male consultant, her language would likely barely earn a sentence, let alone the repeated, pearl-clutching emphasis in this article. The world of politics is practically fueled by coffee, cynicism and four-letter words, yet somehow only a woman's swearing merits anthropological examination.\n\nAs a woman who curses (fluently and without apology), I find this fixation absurd. You have a legitimate story: federal charges, political fallout, potential implications for Gov. Gavin Newsom. Instead, the article reads like it was written by someone astonished to discover that powerful women aren't delicate flowers who speak only in euphemisms.\n\nCover the alleged crimes. Hold her accountable. But spare us the performative shock over her vocabulary. If harsh language in Sacramento is what unsettles you, I'd gently suggest you're covering the wrong f -- ing beat.",

    "body": "Comedian Jeff Dye is the latest Hollywood celebrity to flee the state of California. He says it is because of the Democrat leadership destroying the state.\n\nAppearing on the popular Joe Rogan Experience podcast, Dye announced that he has bought a home in Texas after becoming highly alarmed at the actions of California's radical, left-wing, Democrat Governor, Gavin Newsom.\n\n\"I'm kind of in this kind of LA thing, and I could be guilty of being a victim of what I'm absorbing in my algorithm. But Gavin Newsom scares the shit out of me and I don't want to be a part of it,\" the Wedding Year cast member said.\n\nDye added that the failed response to the Pacific Palisades fire was also a factor in his decision to leave California.\n\n\"Those fires were quite a wake-up call,\" he continued. \"Even if, you know, whatever you believe about the fires, the way it was dealt with was pretty scary.\"\n\nIt was recently reported that since the fire occurred, very few residents have been given permits to rebuild their homes.\n\nThe fire swept through California in January, but now, almost a year later, less than ten percent of homeowners have been given permits to begin rebuilding on their lots, Bloomberg reported.\n\nDye also ridiculed those Hollywood leftists who loudly claimed they would move out of the U.S.A.- but haven't left -- if Donald Trump became president again.\n\n\"They go, 'I'm going to move.' They make those kind of threats,\" Dye scoffed.\n\nWhen Rogan noted that some actually have, Dye replied that he \"respects\" Rosie O'Donnell and Ellen DeGeneres for sticking to their word and actually moving away from the U.S.A.\n\nO'Donnell moved to Ireland early this year while DeGeneres left the U.S. for England in 2024.\n\nStill, Dye also pointed out that leaving the country might mean they also lost their vote if they renounced their citizenship.\n\n\"But at least they left. Hundreds of celebrities said they would leave and didn't,\" he said.\n\nDye is far from the only member of Hollywood's entertainment community to flee La La Land.\n\nThe trend has been clear for years as celebrities have opted to leave L.A., and many even left California altogether.\n\nEntertainers including Mark Wallberg, Sylvester Stallone, Rod Stewart, Sheryl Crow, Dean Cain, Robert Davi, Nikki Sixx, Rob Schneider, Scott Baio, and Sean Patrick Flanery left years ago.\n\nThis year, Ryan Gosling and his wife Eva Mendes were the latest to leave L.A. for a quieter, more sane home in the U.K.\n\nIn October, A-Lister George Clooney explained that he and his wife left Hollywood for a farm in France where they felt more comfortable raising their kids.",

    "body": "This is read by an automated voice. Please report any issues or inconsistencies here.\n\nTo the editor: Thank you for the uplifting article about California having sufficient battery capacity to generate one-third of the estimated capacity needed to reach its goal of 100% clean energy by 2045 (\"Newsom touts California's record battery energy gains at U.N. climate conference,\" Nov. 13). I was shocked to learn the only region or jurisdiction generating more green energy than California is the second-largest economy in the world, China.\n\nCalifornia now ranks as the world's fourth-largest economy, with a GDP of more than $4.1 trillion -- lower than only the U.S. overall, China and Germany. In 2024, California had a GDP growth rate of 6%, outpacing the top three.\n\nMany love to be negative about California and its \"ills,\" but perhaps it's time we started to speak out broadly about our accomplishments in the face of cutbacks nationally in green energy. We watch the federal government attempt to dismantle these initiatives to soothe the ego in the White House. Gov. Gavin Newsom has done a great job tickling President Trump's insecurities -- I hope he continues to do so with California's achievements and green energy.\n\nI believe strongly in the California Dream, and that California will lead the way for the United States to finally join the green revolution we are losing out on. In the great words of my hero Winston Churchill, \"We shall fight on the beaches ... we shall fight in the hills, we shall never surrender!\"\n\nLaurie S. Adami, Los Angeles\n\n..\n\nTo the editor: Our governor could put some of his touted battery power to work preventing fires here in L.A. County and elsewhere. Many fires, including the 2018 Camp fire (Pacific Gas & Electric), the 2019 Kincade fire (PG&E) and potentially the 2019 Saddle Ridge fire (Southern California Edison) and this year's Eaton fire (Edison), have been caused by wind-whipped transmission lines and their towers, especially in hills and canyons where winds are particularly severe and turbulent.\n\nGiven the devastation that has resulted, wouldn't it be sensible to utilize some of that battery power near major destinations so that the use of the dangerous transmission lines could be reined in without interrupting service?\n\nOn Sept. 19, Newsom signed Senate Bill 254, allowing Southern California Edison to pass some of its losses onto ratepayers in surcharges. This, after the company possibly allowed its ratepayers' homes to be destroyed and a few lives lost. Edison also expects to be reimbursed from the state's wildfire fund, which customers pay into. Why can't the governor and Legislature require that some of that money go to a battery system to take the most lethal risks out of the transmission system?",

    "body": "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem responds to the targeting of law enforcement officers on 'Jesse Watters Primetime.'\n\nThe Trump administration filed a lawsuit on Monday challenging California's law banning federal immigration agents from wearing face masks to hide their identities, arguing that the measure is unconstitutional.\n\nThe lawsuit claims that the state does not have the authority to restrict federal agents.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom signed the No Secret Police Act and the No Vigilantes Act into law in September. Under the bills, most law enforcement, including federal agents, would be barred from wearing masks on the job and non-uniformed officers would be required to visibly display identification during their duties.\n\nExceptions to the mask ban would be permitted for undercover agents, for those using medical masks like N95 respirators or as part of tactical gear.\n\nNEWSOM BANS LAW ENFORCEMENT FROM WEARING MASKS, TAUNTS ICE AGENTS: 'WHAT ARE YOU AFRAID OF?'\n\nNewsom said that federal immigration officers would no longer be \"hidden from accountability\" while performing operations in California.\n\n\"That's not the America we've grown up in. And so we are pushing back,\" he said ahead of the bill signings.\n\nFederal agents have conducted immigration raids in Southern California since June, targeting migrant workers at local businesses that sparked protests and the subsequent federal deployment of the National Guard and Marines. During the raids, some federal agents wore masks and hid their identities.\n\nThe administration urged the court to deem the laws a violation of the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution and issue a preliminary injunction blocking California from enforcing the laws.\n\nThe Supremacy Clause establishes that federal law is the \"supreme Law of the Land,\" overriding state law.\n\nCALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE PASSES BILL PROHIBITING LAW ENFORCEMENT FROM WEARING FACE MASKS TO SHIELD IDENTITIES\n\nThe lawsuit also argues that the California laws violate Article 5, Section 301 of the U.S. Code, which says agency heads \"may prescribe regulations for the government of his department [and] the conduct of its employees.\"\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi said on Monday that the California laws \"discriminate against the federal government and are designed to create risk for our agents.\"\n\nAfter Newsom signed the measures, administration officials directed ICE agents to ignore the California laws.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security said on Sept. 22 that it will \"NOT comply with Gavin Newsom's unconstitutional mask ban,\" pointing to an increase in threats towards ICE officers.\n\nThe lawsuit also argues that the California laws \"would recklessly endanger the lives of federal agents and their family members and compromise the operational effectiveness of federal law enforcement activities.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBut supporters of masks for immigration agents say that the use of face coverings generates fear among the public and must be stopped.\n\nNewsom office said that California officials \"will see the [DOJ] in court.\"\n\n\"If the Trump administration cared half as much about public safety as it does about pardoning cop-beaters, violating people's rights, and detaining U.S. citizens and their kids, our communities would be much safer,\" spokesperson Diana Crofts-Pelayo said in a statement to The Hill, referring to President Donald Trump pardoning more than 1,000 people who participated in the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riots.",

    "title": "The Amazon oil that made California rethink its climate playbook",
    "body": "Even as the conference gave Gov. Gavin Newsom and the other Californians a largely warm welcome, it also exposed the awkward reality of California's reliance on oil from the Amazon: A flotilla brought Indigenous activists protesting oil extraction and agribusiness into the port city of Belém from deep in the Amazon, and a separate group of oil protesters even broke into the venue and clashed with U.N. security.\n\nCalifornia's refineries get roughly 30 percent of their oil supplies from the Amazon-region nations of Brazil, Ecuador and Guyana, some of which they go on to sell to neighboring states, according to the California Energy Commission. Brazil alone supplied about 20 percent of the state's imported foreign crude last year, overtaking Saudi Arabia and trailing only Iraq, according to the data.\n\nMost of Brazil's production is offshore and Guyana's is entirely offshore, not in the rainforest itself. But the optics have only sharpened as Brazil pushes to drill at the mouth of the Amazon at the same time as it hosts the climate talks and Ecuador, the main source of Amazonian oil, advances new oil auctions in its rainforest despite opposition from Indigenous groups.\n\nIn-state critics have seized on the contrast: Conservative commentator and GOP gubernatorial candidate Steve Hilton urged U.N. climate conference organizers last week not to grant Newsom a speaking slot because of California's oil imports from the region.\n\nHilton wrote in a letter that \"to have Gavin Newsom lecture the world on climate justice while his administration promotes the decimation of the Amazon would be an insult to the conference and its members.\" (Hilton didn't get a response from the organizers, according to a spokesperson.)\n\nCalifornia Democrats have long dismissed the argument that importing oil from the Amazon harms the environment as merely a justification to boost in-state drilling. But one of the people who's made that argument most loudly, Bakersfield Republican state Sen. Shannon Grove, found new allies this year.\n\nShe partnered with Becker on a Senate resolution supporting Indigenous communities resisting crude extraction in the Amazon, SR 51, earlier this year. The resolution passed unanimously, with support from in-state environmental groups -- a far greater success than Grove's past attempts at legislation to curb California's oil imports from the Amazon.\n\nA few things contributed to that: activists from the Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of the Ecuadorian Amazon pressed their case, traveling to California this summer to meet lawmakers in Sacramento and protesting in kayaks near the Chevron refinery in Richmond. But also, in-state refineries announced they would close, raising fears of a spike in gas prices -- and making lawmakers more sensitive to arguments about where the state's remaining fuel supply comes from.\n\n\"We started this process of really looking holistically at the fuel transition, and part of that is, 'Let's get off of oil from the Amazon,'\" said Becker.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, California oil producers also scored their first major win in years with this year's SB 237, which paves the way for more drilling in Kern County. It marked a major turnaround from just a few years ago, when lobbyists for California oil producers circulated an image of a sloth from the Ecuadorian jungle to urge lawmakers to vote against a state bill requiring a 3,200-foot buffer between new oil wells and neighborhoods, arguing it would increase the state's reliance on out-of-state oil from environmentally sensitive areas. The pitch was met largely with ridicule from Democrats and in-state environmentalists, who not only passed the law but successfully batted back an oil industry attempt to overturn it at the ballot.\n\nKevin Koenig of the environmental nonprofit Amazon Watch, which opposed SB 237, said the group was not seeking any partnership with California oil producers. \"There's no sort of strategy of ours that involves a strange-bedfellow scenario where we're looking to ally with industry,\" he said. \"We really try to have a united front on the need to get off fossil fuels, whether that's the Amazon or California.\"\n\nWhat comes next: California oil producers are focused on the future of the state's refineries, while Amazon Watch and its allies are pushing lawmakers to turn the resolution into a formal task force on Amazon-related extraction and California's role in it. Becker said he has a few more ideas on how to transition California's fuel supply, like possibly getting rid of a California-specific gasoline blend or finding alternatives to promote electric vehicles.\n\nBut none, he said, include further increasing crude oil extraction within California. And Newsom, while in Brazil, dismissed Trump's reported plans to open the waters off the coast of California to more oil as \"dead on arrival.\"\n\nLike this content?

Gavin Newsom was declared the Democratic frontrunner to win back the White House in 2028 by a column in Politico on Saturday.\n\nPolitico senior political columnist Jonathan Martin wrote that Newsom has positioned himself over the past two years as the most viable Democratic contender for the presidency.\n\n\"No Democrat has had a better two years than Gavin Newsom and because of it, the California governor -- a national figure since he was a 36-year-old boy mayor -- has claimed a new title: front-runner,\" Martin wrote.\n\nNEWSOM REBUKES WHITE HOUSE DEFENSE OF PRAYER AFTER SHOOTING: KIDS WERE 'LITERALLY PRAYING AS THEY GOT SHOT AT'\n\nMartin argued that Newsom combines traditional political experience with a strong grasp of social media and the ability to connect with younger voters, making him a promising candidate.\n\n\"By the old rules of Democratic nominations, Newsom fits neatly in the tradition of Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama: younger, outsider candidates who could credibly run fresh campaigns against the Washington status quo of both parties while claiming enough insider credentials to reassure party mandarins who care about such things,\" he wrote. \"Newsom is also the best-positioned Democrat according to the new rules of politics -- namely, whether you are or can become famous by breaking through on social media.\"\n\nMartin also noted Newsom's centrist and inclusive stance within the party as another advantage for the governor.\n\nVP VANCE'S CAMP ACCUSES CALIFORNIA GOV. GAVIN NEWSOM OF DISSEMINATING 'FAKE NEWS' AHEAD OF MARINES CELEBRATION\n\n\"'I want it to be the Manchin to Mamdani party. I want it to be inclusive,' the governor told me last week,\" Martin said, adding \"that Newsom isn't fully comfortable in either faction\" of his party.\n\nMartin dubbed him the \"early front-runner\" because of Newsom's ability to read the moment and make his opposition to President Donald Trump a public focus.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE\n\n\"The newly-elected president, perhaps the most galvanizing political foil the country has ever known, picked a fight with Newsom over the Los Angeles wildfires shortly into 2025. And then Trump elevated the governor further by deploying the National Guard and active-duty Marines into the city by the summer,\" Martin wrote.\n\nAfter those clashes with Trump, Newsom opposed the president in a redistricting fight that Martin credited for making the governor an early leader in the 2028 Democratic primary.\n\nMartin also stated how Newsom's willingness to mock Trump and his supporters online \"has endeared him to the sprawling anti-Trump coalition, even the Newsom skeptics among them.\"",

    "title": "Justice Department sues to block laws restricting masked, unidentified law enforcement officers in California",
    "body": "SACRAMENTO -- The U.S. Department of Justice sued California on Monday to block newly passed laws that prohibit law enforcement officials, including federal immigration agents, from wearing masks and that require them to identify themselves.\n\nThe laws, passed by the California Legislature and signed by Gov. Gavin Newsom, came in the wake of the Trump administration's immigration raids in California, when masked, unidentified federal officers jumped out of vehicles this summer as part of the president's mass deportation program.\n\nAtty. Gen. Pamela Bondi said the laws were unconsitutional and endanger federal officers.\n\n\"California's anti-law enforcement policies discriminate against the federal government and are designed to create risk for our agents,\" Bondi said in a statement. \"These laws cannot stand.\"\n\nThe governor recently signed Senate Bill 627, which bans federal officers from wearing masks during enforcement duties, and Senate Bill 805, which requires federal officers without a uniform to visibly display their name or badge number during operations. Both measures were introduced as a response to the Trump administration's aggressive immigration raids that are often conducted by masked agents in plainclothes and unmarked cars.\n\nThe lawsuit, which names the state of California, Gov. Gavin Newsom and state Atty. Gen. Rob Bonta as defendants, asserts the laws are unconstitutional as only the federal government has the authority to control its agents and any requirements about their uniforms. It further argued that federal agents need to conceal their identities at times due to the nature of their work.\n\n\"Given the personal threats and violence that agents face, federal law enforcement agencies allow their officers to choose whether to wear masks to protect their identities and provide an extra layer of security,\" the lawsuit states. \"Denying federal agencies and officers that choice would chill federal law enforcement and deter applicants for law enforcement positions.\"\n\nFederal agents will not comply with either law, the lawsuit states.\n\n\"The Federal Government would be harmed if forced to comply with either Act, and also faces harm from the real threat of criminal liability for noncompliance,\" the lawsuit states. \"Accordingly, the challenged laws are invalid under the Supremacy Clause and their application to the Federal Government should be preliminarily and permanently enjoined.\"\n\nNewsom previously said it was unacceptable for \"secret police\" to grab people off the streets, and that the new laws were needed to help the public differentiate between imposters and legitimate federal law officers.\n\nThe governor, however, acknowledged the legislation could use more clarifications about safety gear and other exemptions. He directed lawmakers to work on a follow-up bill next year.\n\nIn a Monday statement, Sen. Scott Wiener (D-San Francisco), who introduced SB 627, said the FBI recently warned that \"secret police tactics\" are undermining public safety.\n\n\"Despite what these would-be authoritarians claim, no one is above the law,\" said Wiener. \"We'll see you in court.\"",

    "title": "Trump Administration Asks Court to Block California Ban on Masked Agents",
    "body": "The Trump administration has filed a lawsuit against Gov. Gavin Newsom, challenging a California law he recently signed that prohibits law enforcement officers from wearing masks, a practice that became common this year amid the president's immigration crackdown.\n\nThe suit claims that the mask ban, and a companion measure requiring federal agents to wear identification, are unconstitutional because states do not have the power to regulate federal agencies. It says federal law enforcement agencies will not comply with the pair of state laws, which take effect on Jan. 1, and asks the court to strike them down.\n\n\"California's anti-law enforcement policies discriminate against the federal government and are designed to create risk for our agents. These laws cannot stand,\" Attorney General Pamela Bondi said in a statement.\n\nSeveral states have introduced measures to ban masking by immigration agents, but California was the first to pass one into law.\n\nThe lawsuit comes as little surprise. Mr. Newsom himself said in July that he was \"looking at the constitutionality\" of the bill, months before signing it in September. Legal experts predicted it would be challenged in court, where numerous conflicts between California and the Trump administration are now playing out.\n\n\"If the Trump administration cared half as much about public safety as it does about pardoning cop-beaters, violating people's rights, and detaining U.S. citizens and their kids, our communities would be much safer,\" Izzy Gardon, a spokesman for Mr. Newsom, said in a statement.\n\nSupporters have argued that the measure is constitutional because state and local governments can require federal agencies to follow general laws, such as speed limits. The mask law applies to both federal and local law enforcement agents in California.\n\nScott Wiener, a Democratic state senator who wrote the bill, vowed to fight to defend it.\n\n\"We see I.C.E. and other federal agents going into communities with these ski masks, just terrorizing communities, where you don't even know if someone is an actual agent or not,\" Mr. Wiener said in a video posted on social media.\n\n\"It causes fear, and it's unacceptable in a democracy.\"\n\nThe lawsuit claims that officers must have the option to shield their identities because of the threats and violence they face on the job. It cites a huge increase in assaults and death threats against officers, and says websites publish agents' personal information \"to harass and threaten them and their families.\"\n\n\"Now is an extraordinarily dangerous time to serve in federal law enforcement,\" the lawsuit said.\n\nIt contends that the California laws prohibiting officers from wearing masks and requiring that they display identification \"would recklessly endanger the lives of federal agents and their family members and compromise the operational effectiveness of federal law enforcement activities.\"\n\nBecause federal agencies will not comply with the laws, officers are at risk of criminal prosecution if the laws are not struck down, the suit says. It points to a statement last month by former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who said local police could arrest federal agents if they break California laws during immigration raids.",

    "body": "The U.S. Department of Justice sued the state of California, its governor and attorney general on Monday, challenging what the DOJ claims is an \"unconstitutional\" attempt to impede federal law enforcement by imposing a mask ban and identification requirement on officers.\n\nIn September, Gov. Gavin Newsom signed laws making California the first state in the nation to prohibit federal law enforcement, including agents of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, from hiding their identities, and requiring non-uniformed federal law enforcement to visibly display identification information, including agency, name, or badge number during enforcement duties.\n\nBoth laws take effect Jan. 1.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed in Los Angeles federal court, alleges that the No Secret Police Act and the No Vigilantes Act threaten the safety of officers facing harassment, doxing and violence while carrying out enforcement duties. The DOJ also contends the laws violate the Constitution's Supremacy Clause, under which states have no power to control the operations of the federal government.\n\n\"Law enforcement officers risk their lives every day to keep Americans safe, and they do not deserve to be doxed or harassed simply for carrying out their duties,\" U.S. Attorney General Pamela Bondi said in a statement. \"California's anti-law enforcement policies discriminate against the federal government and are designed to create risk for our agents. These laws cannot stand.\"\n\nThe complaint states that the federal government does not intend to comply with the challenged laws.\n\n\"Assaults against federal agents have exploded over the last few months, thanks in part to recklessness (reckless) political rhetoric aiming to delegitimize our brave agents,\" First Assistant U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli of the Central District of California said.\n\n\"Unconstitutional laws such as this one further endanger our brave men and women protecting our community. Our immigration enforcement will continue unabated and unhindered by unconstitutional state laws enacted by irresponsible politicians.\"",

    "body": "The Trump Justice Department filed a lawsuit Monday to stop California's new law that seeks to ban federal immigration officers from wearing masks to conceal their identities, saying the government \"does not intend to comply.\"\n\nTrump officials cast the state law as an illegal attempt to undermine federal immigration enforcement powers, and said it puts agents and their families at risk by exposing their identities to dangerous people.\n\nThe law, signed by Gov. Gavin Newsom and cheered by anti-ICE activists nationwide, is slated to take effect in January.\n\nMr. Newsom, a Democrat, signed another law requiring officers who aren't in uniform to wear some sort of identification, showing them as federal agents.\n\nAttorney General Pamela Bondi called the laws \"anti-enforcement policies.\"\n\n\"Law enforcement officers risk their lives every day to keep Americans safe, and they do not deserve to be doxed or harassed simply for carrying out their duties,\" she said.\n\nThe department, in the lawsuit, said both laws violate the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution by trying to exert control over how federal law enforcement is carried out.\n\nFederal lawyers also said the law is discriminatory since it only applies to federal officers and not to state officers.\n\nThe department said it is announcing federal agents' intention not to comply now, so that it can get a court ruling before the laws take effect on Jan. 1.\n\nAnti-ICE activists have complained that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which is leading much of President Trump's mass deportation effort, has turned into a secret police with its effort to hide agents' identities while scouring communities for illegal immigrant targets to arrest.\n\nActivists have tried to catalog the identities of officers they have been able to identify, leading to some reports of harassment.\n\nHomeland Security says ICE officers have seen a surge in both assaults and death threats aimed at them.\n\nCalifornia's anti-masking law is known as the No Secret Police Act. The law requiring federal officers out of uniform to wear visible identification that denotes their agency or a badge number is called the No Vigilantes Act.\n\nThat's in response to what law enforcement acknowledges has been a notable increase in publicly reported cases of people pretending to be immigration officers.\n\nIn a bulletin last month, the FBI said criminals had been found posing as immigration officers to carry out robberies, kidnappings and sexual assaults.\n\nThe bulletin, reported by Wired, cited five incidents in 2025 and attributed the increase to ICE's higher profile amid Mr. Trump's immigration enforcement push.",

    "title": "Gavin Newsom preens in Brazil  --  while California drowns at home",
    "body": "Gov. Gavin Newsom is prancing around abroad while Californians suffer through a natural disaster -- and not for the first time.\n\nThe well-coiffed presidential hopeful has a habit of being out of the state during major storms.\n\nIn 2023, he left during a deadly blizzard for a vacation in Mexico. While residents of California's high country were trapped in their homes, Newsom was sunning himself on a beach in Baja on a \"personal trip\" he wouldn't cancel.\n\nThis time, Newsom is away at the 2025 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Brazil, hobnobbing with foreign leaders.\n\nHis goal: to pose as president for a week, attacking the Trump administration for its absence while signing toothless agreements to save the planet.\n\nOn Saturday, as Californians were evacuating their homes and dodging \"catastrophic\" flash floods, Newsom was posting excitedly on X about meeting the vice mayor of Rio de Janeiro.\n\nIt's not that he was unaware of the danger: His official \"CAGovernor\" account reposted several warnings from federal, state and local government agencies back home about the imminent danger posed by the storm.\n\nThese posts alternated with videos of Newsom hiking into the Amazon to visit an indigenous community, and to see a 15-story weather-monitoring tower.\n\nApparently, Newsom cares less about the weather at home than the weather in the rainforest.\n\nNot that he cares about the rainforest all that much.\n\nAs Newsom lamented the Brazilian ecosystem's destruction, his own policies have accelerated it.\n\nCalifornia imports more oil from Brazil -- 20% of its total supply -- than from any country other than Iraq.\n\nThat's because Newsom and his Democrats have restricted production in oil-rich California.\n\nWhile pretending to eliminate fossil fuels, California has become more dependent on foreign oil, including offshore oil in Brazil, where drilling will soon begin near the mouth of the Amazon..\n\nThat is just one example of California's climate hypocrisy.\n\nNewsom and his party have dragged their feet in clearing brush from state land, and have prevented the logging industry from doing so -- again, supposedly to save the planet.\n\nThe result: massive wildfires that, in just one year, erased all of the emissions gains from nearly two decades of \"green\" policies in the state.\n\nThe recent Palisades Fire began on state land, partly due to Newsom's environmentalist extremism.\n\nNewsom has another explanation: the Palisades Fire, he told a gathering in Brazil, was due to climate change.\n\n\"We're on the tip of the spear of climate change,\" he said. \"Simultaneous droughts and simultaneous floods.\"\n\nThat is a shift from Newsom's other recent explanation, when faced with a lawsuit from devastated residents: He blamed the arsonist who allegedly started a New Year's Day blaze that reignited as the Palisades Fire in high winds on Jan. 7.\n\nAt the time, Newsom claimed that he had pre-deployed firefighting resources across Southern California in anticipation of the danger.\n\nBut he did not send crews to the site of the New Year's Day fire, where the danger was most acute -- and where state land was involved.\n\nNewsom did not make sure the state's emergency response was prepared for the worst, his most important responsibility as governor.\n\nAnd with these latest storms, Newsom is literally phoning it in from Brazil.\n\nNewsom has attacked Republicans -- often -- for leaving their states during disasters.\n\nOne of his favorite targets is Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, who was infamously caught leaving his state for Cancún, Mexico, during a deadly winter freeze.\n\n\"To be fair, he knows a lot about fleeing,\" the governor posted in August, above a photo of Cruz at the airport.\n\nWith that history in mind, Newsom ought to have been on the first flight home to California to lead the storm response.\n\nBut no -- as of Sunday, Newsom was still in Brazil.\n\nHe stayed because he knows the media -- especially in California -- will never apply the same standards to him as it does to Republicans.\n\nAnd he stayed because he is betting that Democratic presidential primary voters care less about a candidate's performance than about how hard he or she fought Donald Trump.\n\nIt's why Newsom has put $40 billion in fire aid at risk by attacking the president instead of working with him.\n\nClimate change is also a useful excuse for Newsom and for other Democrats to shirk basic governing responsibilities.\n\nIf fires and floods threaten California communities, that's because of fossil fuels and the nasty Republicans who support them -- not because Democrats have refused to clear the brush or to build new dams.\n\nIf no one is in charge during disasters, forcing residents to face danger alone, so much the better: Disaster drives home the climate-hysteria point.\n\nNewsom's goal in Brazil goes beyond typical green ideology: He is pursuing his own personal political ambitions.\n\nFresh from his Proposition 50 victory, he wants the \"B-roll\" footage for future presidential campaign ads, showing him pressing the flesh on the world stage.\n\nIf Californians have to endure torrential rainfall, flash floods and mudslides on their own, so be it.\n\nAfter all, he has bigger, global problems to solve on his way to the Democratic nomination.",

Gavin Newsom called the deployment \"illegal,\" saying California's National Guard should never have been used for Trump's immigration enforcement agenda.\n\nHundreds of National Guard troops deployed to Chicago and Portland, Ore., are being sent home, and those who will remain will continue to stay off the streets amid court battles over their deployment by the Trump administration, a defense official said Monday.\n\nThe withdrawal of soldiers -- sent from California and Texas -- is part of a larger change to troop deployments after President Trump began his immigration crackdown in various cities with Democratic leadership. The official requested anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the issue.\n\nU.S. Northern Command said in a statement Sunday it was \"shifting and/or rightsizing\" units in Portland, Los Angeles and Chicago. Although it said there would be a \"constant, enduring, and long-term presence in each city.\"\n\nIn the coming days, 200 California National Guard troops currently deployed to Oregon will be sent home, and about 100 will remain in the Portland area doing training, the official said. The military also plans to cut in half the number of Oregon National Guard troops on deployment there from 200 soldiers to 100, the official said.\n\nAbout 200 Texas National Guard troops in Chicago also are being sent home and about 200 soldiers will be on standby at Fort Bliss, an Army base that stretches across parts of Texas and New Mexico, the official said.\n\nAbout 300 Illinois National Guard troops will remain in the Chicago area, also doing training, but they currently are not legally allowed to conduct operations with the Department of Homeland Security, the official said.\n\nThe official said the upcoming holiday season may have played a role in the change in deployments.\n\nDiana Crofts-Pelayo, a spokesperson for California Gov. Gavin Newsom, said Trump \"never should have illegally deployed our troops in the first place.\"\n\n\"We're glad they're finally coming home,\" she wrote in an email. \"It's long overdue!\"\n\nSeparately, the Trump administration has stepped up immigration enforcement in Charlotte, North Carolina, expanding an aggressive campaign that's been spearheaded by U.S. Customs and Border Protection.\n\nNational Guard deployments have been one of the most controversial initiatives of Trump's second term, demonstrating an expanded willingness to use the military to accomplish domestic goals.\n\nTroops, including active-duty Marines, were deployed to Los Angeles during immigration protests earlier this year.\n\nThe National Guard was also sent to Washington, D.C., where they were part of a broader federal intervention that Trump claimed was necessary because of crime problems.\n\nThe deployments later expanded to Portland and Chicago.\n\nAlthough they don't play a law enforcement role, members of the National Guard have been tasked with protecting federal facilities, particularly those run by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\nAbout 100 troops who have been in Los Angeles will remain on deployment, the defense official said.",

The president has called state lawmakers and Vice President JD Vance visited the state earlier this autumn to discuss redistricting.\n\nAnd Fox News has confirmed that Trump has invited some of the Indiana Republicans who are holding out against redistricting to White House meetings in the coming days. The news was first reported by Politico.\n\nTrump, in his Sunday post, also took a jab at Republican Gov. Mike Braun of Indiana, arguing that the governor \"perhaps, is not working the way he should to get the necessary Votes.\"\n\nBraun on Monday wrote on social media that \"I just had a great call with President Trump! I told him I remain committed to standing with him on the critical issue of passing fair maps in Indiana to ensure the MAGA agenda is successful in Congress.\"\n\nAnd the governor claimed that \"the Indiana State Senate is hiding behind closed doors and refusing to even bring redistricting to a vote. Hoosiers deserve to know where their legislators stand and expect them to show up for work, not walk out and hide in the dark.\"\n\nNEWSOM TAKES VICTORY LAP AFTER LANDSLIDE REDISTRICTING VICTORY IN CALIFORNIA\n\nThe push by the president in Indiana is part of a broad effort by Trump's political team and the GOP to pad the party's razor-thin House majority to keep control of the chamber in next year's midterms, when the party in power traditionally faces political headwinds and loses seats.\n\nTrump is aiming to prevent what happened during his first term in the White House when Democrats reclaimed the House majority in the 2018 midterm elections.\n\nTexas, Missouri, North Carolina, and Ohio have drawn new maps as part of the president's push. And Florida and Kansas are also mulling redrawing their maps.\n\n\"We must keep the Majority at all costs,\" Trump wrote Monday.\n\nBut Democrats are fighting back.\n\nCalifornia voters two weeks ago overwhelmingly passed Proposition 50, a ballot initiative which will temporarily sidetrack the left-leaning state's nonpartisan redistricting commission and return the power to draw the congressional maps to the Democrat-dominated legislature.\n\nThat is expected to result in five more Democratic-leaning congressional districts in California, which would counter the passage earlier this year in Texas of a new map that aims to create up to five right-leaning House seats.\n\nCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIllinois and Maryland, two blue states, and Virginia, where Democrats control the legislature, are also taking steps or seriously considering redistricting.\n\nAnd in a blow to Republicans, a Utah district judge last week rejected a congressional district map drawn up by the state's GOP-dominated legislature and instead approved an alternate that will create a Democratic-leaning district ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.",

    "title": "Opinion | California's wealth-tax test",
    "body": "California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) in Brazil last week for the COP30 U.N. Climate Summit. (Fernando Llano/AP)\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom has been trying to position himself as the leader of a listless Democratic Party ahead of his likely presidential run. He's had some success energizing the base, but will the ambitious governor survive standing up to what could be his state's greatest act of economic self-sabotage in recent history?\n\nA health care workers' union recently proposed a referendum that would impose a 5 percent wealth tax on billionaires living in California. Its supporters will soon begin collecting the nearly 875,000 signatures they need to get on the ballot in time for next year's midterm election.\n\nThis would only be a one-time hit on the entirety of any given billionaire's assets to fund health care spending, insists the Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West. The levy would hit those who were California residents on Jan. 1, 2026, based on their wealth as of Dec. 31, 2026. They would have five years to pay and better hope that their wealth, which can be fickle for paper billionaires, remains high enough to come up with the cash. No matter what their advocates promise, taxes are rarely ever one-off.\n\nThe group believes this could raise about $100 billion. But there's reason to doubt those revenue projections, which have often been inaccurate in countries that imposed wealth taxes. There are about 255 billionaires in California now, and it's unclear how many count as state residents.\n\nSet aside the legal challenges that would inevitably follow and could prevent the tax from ever being levied. The most likely result is that billionaires would flee, so the state would also lose non-wealth-tax revenue. The risk of the measure passing might even cause some billionaires to leave, just in case. This initiative seems almost tailor-made to drive most Silicon Valley tech companies to Austin, Texas.\n\nNo doubt, Newsom understands the state probably wouldn't recover from such an event, which is why he opposes the measure. His allies have already launched a political action committee to fight it. This sets him apart from Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Massachusetts), whose proposal for a 2 percent wealth tax was a centerpiece of her 2020 campaign.\n\nSupporters of the initiative say that it will pursue all wealth, from art collections to closely-held companies. Income, which is relatively easy to measure, already requires massive bureaucracy to police. Including all kinds of exquisite property will lead to state workers spending countless hours guessing how much racehorses and fine wine collections are worth.\n\nThere are many other good reasons why only four countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development currently have wealth taxes, down from a dozen in the 1990s. A complex tax code means a corrupt one. Sweden's wealth tax, which stood at 1.5 percent before its repeal in 2007, discriminated between different kinds of assets. Either California's wealthy would lobby for their investments to get favorable treatment, or politicians would decide on a whim what they think should be left alone. Either approach would inevitably distort investment decisions and make the economy less productive.\n\nThere are plenty of policy failures in California, where high taxes and unaffordability have caused hundreds of thousands to flee the state. Yet Newsom, governor since 2019, is running on his record -- which is why he doesn't want to own the devastating consequences of a wealth tax. More interesting than his electoral calculation, however, is what policy and moral arguments he uses against the tax. His approach, and how voters respond, will speak volumes about the state of Democratic Party as it seeks its way out of the political wilderness.",

    "title": "Column: Sacramento scandal a wild card for Xavier Becerra and the governor's race",
    "body": "SACRAMENTO -- So far, gubernatorial candidate Xavier Becerra has escaped the bright spotlight focused on Gov. Gavin Newsom in the money pilfering scandal involving their former top aides. But that could change.\n\nIt seems only a matter of time before one of Becerra's campaign rivals seizes the federal fraud case for attack fodder. I can hear it already: \"If the man who wants to be governor can't protect his own political funds, he shouldn't be trusted to safeguard your tax money.\"\n\nThat might not be fair, but this is big-time politics. And the word \"fair\" isn't in the political dictionary.\n\nNeither Becerra nor Newsom is implicated in any wrongdoing.\n\nNewsom has drawn heavy media attention because his former chief of staff, Dana Williamson, is the central figure in the criminal case. Newsom also has made himself into a national political celebrity and the leader in early polling for the 2028 Democratic presidential nomination. That makes him prime news copy.\n\nBecerra is low-profile by comparison, although he has achieved a very successful and respectable career: U.S. Health and Human Services secretary under President Biden, California attorney general and 12-term congressman.\n\nIt was Becerra's dormant state political account that allegedly got pilfered of $225,000 while he was health secretary.\n\nFederal prosecutors allege that Williamson, former Becerra chief of staff Sean McCluskie and Sacramento lobbyist Greg Campbell illegally diverted money to McCluskie's wife, funneling the loot through shell companies for bogus consulting services.\n\nMcCluskie and Campbell both pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit fraud and have been cooperating with the federal government.\n\nWilliamson, who allegedly fleeced Becerra's political kitty when she owned a government relations firm before joining Newsom's staff, pleaded not guilty to bank and tax fraud charges. Besides raiding Becerra's account, she's accused of falsifying documents involving a COVID small-business loan and claiming $1 million in personal luxuries as business expenses on her income taxes.\n\nAfter news of the case broke last week with Williamson's arrest, Newsom's office said the governor suspended her last November after she informed him of the federal investigation.\n\nThere also was a sophomoric attempt by a Newsom spokesperson to link the federal case to the combative relationship between President Trump and the California governor. It's true Trump has been targeting his \"enemies.\" But this three-year FBI probe began under the Biden administration.\n\nBecerra issued a statement saying that the \"formal accusations of impropriety by a long-serving trusted advisor are a gut punch.\" He also said he had been cooperating with the U.S. Justice Department's investigation.\n\nThe federal indictment alleges that McCluskie and Williamson misled Becerra about how monthly withdrawals from his political account were to be used.\n\nThe account stash of nearly $2 million was raised for a 2022 attorney general reelection campaign that never occurred because by then Becerra was health secretary. But the money could be used in some future state race, such as for governor.\n\nPolitical operatives I talked with were stunned that $225,000 could be siphoned out of a politician's campaign account without him noticing.\n\n\"Did the account have no one watching it except the consultants who were pilfering from it?\" asked veteran Democratic consultant Garry South. \"Those of us who have run campaigns are scratching our heads. I can't imagine how this would happen.\"\n\nI asked the Becerra campaign.\n\nA spokesperson replied that the health secretary had authorized payments for \"campaign management\" after being misled by trusted advisors.\n\nAlso, the spokesperson added, Becerra was counseled by a Health and Human Services attorney to distance himself from any \"campaign or political activity\" prohibited by the federal Hatch Act and ethics rules. So he delegated responsibility for managing the account to advisors.\n\nAnd he got snookered and ripped off.\n\nWill it tarnish Becerra's image and hurt his campaign for governor? We don't know yet. But probably not that much, if any. His only sin, after all, was trusting the wrong people and following an attorney's advice.\n\nEven big scandals don't seem to damage politicians in this era -- Trump being the unfathomable best example.\n\nIt could crimp Becerra's fundraising if potential donors wonder where their money is actually going and whether anyone credible will be watching it.\n\nThe gubernatorial race is still wide open without a real front-runner. No candidate is captivating the voters.\n\nA late October poll by the UC Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies showed paltry numbers for all candidates. Former Orange County Rep. Katie Porter led Democrats with 11% support among registered voters. Becerra was second with 8%. A whopping 44% of those surveyed were undecided.\n\nRiverside County Sheriff Chad Blanco, a Republican, was first overall with 13%. But no Republican need apply for this job. California hasn't elected a GOP candidate to a statewide office since 2006.\n\nBecerra has as good a shot at winning as any current candidate. He was the leading Democrat among Latinos at 12%.",

    "title": "California yanks illegal immigrants' trucker's licenses; Newsom says migrant status not a factor",
    "body": "California has moved to cancel licenses of 17,000 commercial drivers after a back-and-forth with the Trump administration, which is pushing to get what it calls \"dangerous foreign drivers\" off U.S. roads.\n\nTransportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced the cancellations last week, saying California had finally bowed to pressure to kick people the feds say are illegal immigrants off the roads.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom's office acknowledged the revocations but rejected the claim that they were illegal immigrants. It said they were booted because of \"inconsistency\" with state law.\n\n\"After weeks of claiming they did nothing wrong, Gavin Newsom and California have been caught red-handed. Now that we've exposed their lies, 17,000 illegally issued trucking licenses are being revoked,\" Mr. Duffy said.\n\nMr. Newsom's office, for its part, mocked Mr. Duffy for his role on MTV's reality TV show \"Road Rules\" in the 1990s and said he was \"spreading easily disproven falsehoods in a sad and desperate attempt to please his 'dear leader.'\"\n\nAs that back-and-forth was playing out, however, a federal appeals court put a hold on Mr. Duffy's new regulation aimed at stripping illegal immigrants and other \"non-domiciled\" foreign drivers off the road.\n\nThe U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, in a 2-1 ruling, said Mr. Duffy cut too many corners in issuing the rule -- and said the foreign drivers at issue are actually safer than other commercial drivers.\n\nThey also said the migrants themselves, as well as the economy, have come to rely on the migrant drivers and taking them off the road \"would have public safety by forcing it to replace safer experienced drivers with less-safe new drivers.\"\n\nU.S. Circuit Judge Karen Henderson, a George H.W. Bush appointee, dissented, saying she thought the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration made a good showing of the need for the rule, which she said should have been good enough at this point in the litigation.\n\nThe rule at issue limited states' ability to issue commercial driver's licenses to people whose addresses were foreign domiciles but who live in the U.S.\n\nThe government said those drivers fell into a loophole.\n\nBecause much of their driving history exists in their home countries, states struggle to make determinations on whether they should be granted licenses.\n\nJudge Henderson said that made sense, and it was an error for the court to substitute its judgment for the government.\n\n\"It should go without saying that our nation's roadways are safer the fewer people there are operating eighteen-wheelers, buses and delivery trucks with unchecked driving histories,\" she wrote.\n\nShe said the government also provided examples of five recent fatal crashes -- which claimed 12 lives -- involving foreign-domiciled commercial drivers. She said an audit of their foreign records might have denied them permits.\n\nIt's not clear what effect the court ruling will have on the 17,000 revoked licenses in California. Neither that state's motor vehicle bureau nor the U.S. Transportation Department responded to inquiries for this story.\n\nMr. Duffy said the 17,000 were \"just the tip of the iceberg.\"\n\n\"My team will continue to force California to prove they have removed every illegal immigrant from behind the wheel of semitrucks and school buses,\" he said.\n\nMr. Newsom's press office denied the label \"illegal immigrant,\" saying they had \"legal presence\" and had been issued work permits by Homeland Security.\n\nWork permits can, in fact, be issued to migrants who are here without a legal visa.\n\nAs one example, the Biden administration granted millions of illegal border crossers \"parole,\" giving them the tentative legal presence Mr. Newsom's office cited. But they are still inadmissible aliens, or what would usually be considered illegal immigrants.\n\nMr. Duffy also said that California issued driver's licenses that are valid for years after their work permits expire.\n\n\"Blatantly lying to the American people won't help Newsom's keyboard warriors get their next jobs,\" the secretary said.\n\nHe said California was a major reason he issued the non-domiciled driver rule.\n\nThe Transportation Department said Wednesday that it will continue to urge California to revoke all illegal non-domiciled CDLs or risk losing $160 million in federal funds.",

You could almost hear the words spoken in unison in every government office, trade association, consultant business and lobbyist shop in California:\n\n\"It's illegal???\"\n\nYes, according to the federal government, it's illegal to run a scheme to siphon money from a campaign account, pass it through a lot of consultants and land it in the bank accounts of people with no-show jobs. Former Newsom chief of staff Dana Williamson is alleged to have done that.\n\nIt's also illegal to grift off the COVID paycheck protection program and to deduct the cost of personal luxuries as business expenses on your federal tax return, thereby failing to pay what Democrats like to call \"your fair share.\" Williamson was charged with conspiracy and tax evasion.\n\nNotice that there have been no state prosecutions. No campaign finance regulators audited the oddity of $10,000-per-month payments to a political consultant from a campaign committee that was just a motionless pot to park money.\n\nFormer California Attorney General Xavier Becerra owned the committee at the center of these charges, \"Becerra for Superintendent of Public Instruction, 2030.\" At the time the $10,000-per-month payments were leaving that account, Becerra was the Secretary of Health and Human Services in the Biden administration.\n\nNow he's back in California, running for governor in 2026. But the campaign committee for the 2030 race for superintendent is still active. As of June 30, the Becerra for Superintendent committee reported having a little more than $1.4 million in cash on hand. The Becerra for Governor committee ended the second quarter with $2.1 million.\n\nSometimes donors love a candidate so madly, they wish there were two committees so they could give twice as much. This is what Democrats like to call \"a norm.\"\n\nThe Democratic leader of the state Senate, Mike McGuire, currently has three active state campaign committees, separate from the federal committee that will accept donations for his just-announced run for Congress. As of June 30, McGuire had more than $1.1 million in his McGuire for Insurance Commissioner 2026 committee, $691,301 in the McGuire Ballot Measure Committee, and $84,362 in his still-active McGuire for State Senate 2022 committee.\n\nGenerally speaking, everything's legal in California politics as long as the forms are filled out correctly.\n\nIn August 2019, San Diego Democratic Assemblyman Todd Gloria failed to fill out a form correctly. He signed a statement of intention under penalty of perjury saying he was running for reelection to the Assembly in 2020. But he was running for mayor of San Diego at the time. The false statement allowed him to transfer his leftover campaign funds from 2018, about $300,000, to a fake 2020 campaign committee account. That prevented the 2018 funds from becoming \"surplus,\" meaning he might have had to donate them to, perish the thought, charity.\n\nAfter one of his opponents for mayor complained to the Fair Political Practices Commission that Gloria was collecting donations for the fake Assembly race that exceeded the contribution limits for the mayor's race, Gloria was fined $200 for the false statement. Today he's mayor of San Diego.\n\nThe California Secretary of State's website shows a long list of 2030 campaign committees where money has been parked by current office holders. For example, Los Angeles City Councilman Adrin Nazarian, who previously served in the state Assembly from 2012 to 2022, has $636,466 in a Nazarian for State Controller 2030 campaign committee. Reports filed with the Secretary of State show that in the first half of this year the committee had more than $14,000 in expenditures, mostly for taxes, credit card payments and donations to Democratic party organizations. Nazarian's salary as a city council member is $244,727 annually, but the donors to his past campaigns are covering a few expenses here and there.\n\nDana Williamson pleaded not guilty to all charges against her, but two others charged in the scheme, Sacramento lobbyist Greg Campbell and former Becerra chief of staff Sean McCluskie, entered into plea deals last week. Williamson's attorney, McGregor Scott, told Politico the FBI asked Williamson last year to assist in an investigation into Newsom. He said she refused, stating that \"she had not seen any misconduct by the governor of any kind.\"\n\nBut you wouldn't believe what's legal in California.\n\nFor elected officials who fill out the forms correctly, it's completely legal to call people with business before the state and ask them to make enormous contributions for \"charitable,\" \"legislative\" or \"governmental\" purposes that happen to benefit the elected official and family members. This is a category of unlimited political donations called \"behested payments,\" as in \"payments made at the behest\" of an elected official.\n\nNewsom has used this legalized shakedown to direct more than $3.7 million of other people's money to his wife's \"California Partners Project,\" for the \"charitable\" purpose of supporting \"the work.\" In April, the Federated Indians of Graton Rancheria gave $500,000. Five-figure donors last year include the California Chamber of Commerce, Blue Shield of California, Pinterest and The California Endowment. Overall, Newsom has hit up the California Endowment, a nonprofit foundation, for more than $5.6 million. This includes $5 million in COVID relief money, $150,000 to help migrants crossing the border into California, and $10,000 to the California State Protocol Foundation to support \"convening to discuss cell phone use in schools.\"\n\nNewsom also shoveled more than $4 million of the $8.8 million he \"behested\" from special-interest donors for his inaugural festivities into the California State Protocol Foundation, which paid for his photogenic trip to China in 2023.\n\nNewsom \"behested\" California Forward, a \"multi-partisan 501(c)(3) nonprofit\" into paying almost $382,000 in 2022-23 to Antonio Villaraigosa, now a candidate for governor, for a job as an \"infrastructure czar\" who could not be paid by the state for some reason.\n\nIt's all legal, at least under California law. Under federal law, the new state capital might be Alcatraz.",

    "body": "Two high-profile Democrats visited the Lone Star State recently and credited Democrats in the Texas House for igniting a nationwide redistricting battle.\n\nIllinois Governor JB Pritzker addressed 650 people at the Dallas County Democratic Party's Johnson Jordan Dinner last Monday.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers from Texas travelled to Chicago over the summer as they broke quorum, delaying a vote by House Republicans to add five Congressional seats.\n\n\"By breaking quorum, you ignited our victories, and you showed us how to fight and win in 2026,\" Pritzker told Democrats. \"You inspire us all. In this moment when we Democrats are sorting through who's on Team Fight and who's on Team Cave, it's important to remember that the fighters are those who've been through the battles before and realize to win, you need to be relentless.\"\n\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom travelled to Houston, where he spoke before hundreds of Democrats. He told them they need to have their sights set on the U.S. House next year.\n\n\"There is no more important race in our lifetimes than the House of Representatives and taking back the House and getting Speaker Jeffries sworn in next November,\" Newsom said. \"It's the whole thing. It's the whole thing.\"\n\nDemocrats and multiple organizations in Texas filed suit against the state in an attempt to block the newly drawn Congressional maps approved by Republicans.\n\nA three-judge panel at the federal court in El Paso held a trial between October 1-10, but they have not decided yet whether to uphold or throw out the maps. Any decision will likely be appealed directly to the U.S. Supreme Court. Because there is no court ruling yet, some candidates running for Congress, particularly Democrats, haven't been able to file their campaign paperwork after the process began Saturday, November 8. The filing deadline is Monday, December 8.",

    "title": "Commentary: Front-runner or flash in the pan? Sizing up Newsom, 2028",
    "body": "California has been a liability to candidates and with housing costs and homelessness at crisis levels that's not likely to change.\n\nThe 2028 presidential election is more than 1,000 days away, but you'd hardly know it from all the speculation and anticipation that's swirling from Sacramento to the Washington Beltway.\n\nTimes columnists Anita Chabria and Mark Z. Barabak disagree on Newsom's presidential prospects, and more. Here the two hash out some of their differences.\n\nBarabak: So is the presidential race over, Anita? Should I just spend the next few years backpacking and snowboarding in the Sierra and return in January 2029 to watch Newsom iterate, meet the moment and, with intentionality, be sworn in as our nation's 48th president?\n\nChabria: You should definitely spend as much time in the Sierra as possible, but I have no idea if Newsom will be elected president in 2028 or not. That's about a million light-years away in political terms. But I think he has a shot, and is the front-runner for the nomination right now. He's set himself up as the quick-to-punch foil to President Trump, and increasingly as the leader of the Democratic Party. Last week, he visited Brazil for a climate summit that Trump ghosted, making Newsom the American presence.\n\nAnd in a recent (albeit small) poll, in a hypothetical race against JD Vance, the current Republican favorite, Newsom lead by three points. Though, unexpectedly, respondents still picked Kamala Harris as their choice for the nomination.\n\nTo me, that shows he's popular across the country. But you've warned that Californians have a tough time pulling voters in other states. Do you think his Golden State roots will kill off his contender status?\n\nBarabak: I make no predictions. I'm smart enough to know that I'm not smart enough to know. And, after 2016 and the election of Trump, the words \"can't,\" \"not,\" \"won't,\" \"never ever\" are permanently stricken from my political vocabulary.\n\nThat said, I wouldn't stake more than a penny -- which may eventually be worth something, as they're phased out of our currency -- on Newsom's chances.\n\nLook, I yield to no one in my love of California. (And I've got the Golden State tats to prove it.) But I'm mindful of how the rest of the country views the state and those politicians who bear a California return address. You can be sure whoever runs against Newsom -- and I'm talking about his fellow Democrats, not just Republicans -- will have a great deal to say about the state's much-higher-than-elsewhere housing, grocery and gas prices and our shameful rates of poverty and homelessness.\n\nNot a great look for Newsom, especially when affordability is all the political rage these days.\n\nAnd while I understand the governor's appeal -- Fight! Fight! Fight! -- I liken it to the fleeting fancy that, for a time, made attorney, convicted swindler and rhetorical battering ram Michael Avenatti seriously discussed as a Democratic presidential contender. At a certain point -- and we're still years away -- people will assess the candidates with their head, not viscera.\n\nAs for the polling, ask Edmund Muskie, Gary Hart or Hillary Clinton how much those soundings matter at this exceedingly early stage of a presidential race. Well, you can't ask Muskie, because the former Maine senator is dead. But all three were early front-runners who failed to win the Democratic nomination.\n\nChabria: I don't argue the historical case against the Golden State, but I will argue that these are different days. People don't vote with their heads. Fight me on that.\n\nThey vote on charisma, tribalism, and maybe some hope and fear. They vote on issues as social media explains them. They vote on memes.\n\nThere no reality in which our next president is rationally evaluated on their record -- our current president has a criminal one and that didn't make a difference.\n\nBut I do think, as we've talked about ad nauseam, that democracy is in peril. Trump has threatened to run for a third term and recently lamented that his Cabinet doesn't show him the same kind of fear that Chinese President Xi Jinping gets from his top advisers. And Vance, should he get the chance to run, has made it clear he's a Christian nationalist who would like to deport nearly every immigrant he can catch, legal or not.\n\nBeing a Californian may not be the drawback it's historically been, especially if Trump's authoritarianism continues and this state remains the symbol of resistance.\n\nBut our governor does have an immediate scandal to contend with. His former chief of staff, Dana Williamson, was just arrested on federal corruption charges. Do you think that hurts him?\n\nBarabak: It shouldn't.\n\nThere's no evidence of wrongdoing on Newsom's part. His opponents will try the guilt-by-association thing. Some already have. But unless something damning surfaces, there's no reason the governor should be punished for the alleged wrongdoing of Williamson or others charged in the case.\n\nBut let's go back to 2028 and the presidential race. I think one of our fundamental disagreements is that I believe people do very much evaluate a candidate's ideas and records. Not in granular fashion, or the way some chin-stroking political scientist might. But voters do want to know how and whether a candidate can materially improve their lives.\n\nThere are, of course, a great many who'd reflexively support Donald Trump, or Donald Duck for that matter, if he's the Republican nominee. Same goes for Democrats who'd vote for Gavin Newsom or Gavin Floyd, if either were the party's nominee. (While Newsom played baseball in college, Floyd pitched 13 seasons in the major leagues, so he's got that advantage over the governor.)\n\nBut I'm talking about those voters who are up for grabs -- the ones who decide competitive races -- who make a very rational decision based on their lives and livelihoods and which candidate they believe will benefit them most.\n\nGranted, the dynamic is a bit different in a primary contest. But even then, we've seen time and again the whole dated/married phenomenon. As in 2004, when a lot of Democrats \"dated\" Howard Dean early in the primary season but \"married\" John Kerry. I see electability -- as in the perception of which Democrat can win the general election -- being right up there alongside affordability when it comes time for primary voters to make their 2028 pick.\n\nChabria: No doubt affordability will be a huge issue, especially if consumer confidence continues to plummet. And we are sure to hear criticisms of California, many of which are fair, as you point out. Housing costs too much, homelessness remains intractable.\n\nBut these are also problems across the United States, and require deeper fixes than even this economically powerful state can handle alone. More than past record, future vision is going to matter. What's the plan?\n\nIt can't be vague tax credits or even student loan forgiveness. We need a concrete vision for an economy that brings not just more of the basics like homes, but the kind of long-term economic stability -- higher wages, good schools, living-wage jobs -- that makes the middle class stronger and attainable.\n\nThe Democrat who can lay out that vision while simultaneously continuing to battle the authoritarian creep currently eating our democracy will, in my humble opinion, be the one voters choose, regardless of origin story. After all, it was that message of change with hope that gave us President Obama, another candidate many considered a long shot at first.\n\nMark, are there any 2028 prospects you're keeping a particularly close eye on?\n\nBarabak: I'm taking things one election at a time, starting with the 2026 midterms, which include an open-seat race for governor here in California. The results in November 2026 will go a long way toward shaping the dynamic in November 2028. That said, there's no shortage of Democrats eyeing the race -- too many to list here. Will the number surpass the 29 major Democrats who ran in 2020? We'll see.\n\nI do agree with you that, to stand any chance of winning in 2028, whomever Democrats nominate will have to offer some serious and substantive ideas on how to make people's lives materially better. Imperiled democracy and scary authoritarianism aside, it's still the economy, stupid.\n\nWhich brings us full circle, back to our gallivanting governor. He may be winning fans and building his national fundraising base with his snippy memes and zippy Trump put-downs. But even if he gets past the built-in anti-California bias among so many voters outside our blessed state, he's not going to snark his way to the White House.",

    "body": "Comedian Jeff Dye is joining the growing wave of entertainers leaving Los Angeles behind.\n\nDuring a Nov. 2 appearance on \"The Joe Rogan Experience,\" the 42-year-old \"The Wedding Year\" alum revealed he was buying a house in Texas after becoming deeply concerned by the direction California was taking under the leadership of Gov. Gavin Newsom.\n\n\"I'm kind of in this kind of LA thing, and I could be guilty of being a victim of what I'm absorbing in my algorithm. But Gavin Newsom scares the s-t out of me and I don't want to be a part of it,\" Dye said.\n\nDye also noted he was alarmed by the state and city governments' response to the fires that devastated parts of LA in January.\n\n\"Those fires were quite a wake-up call,\" he said. \"Even if, you know, whatever you believe about the fires, the way it was dealt with was pretty scary.\"\n\nFox News Digital has reached out to Newsom's office for comment.\n\nThe LA fires scorched over 55,000 acres, destroyed more than 16,000 buildings and caused at least 29 deaths.\n\nThe two largest fires were the Palisades Fire, which burned 6,837 buildings and killed 12 people, and the Eaton Fire, which decimated 9,414 buildings and claimed 18 lives.\n\nBoth Newsom and LA Mayor Karen Bass faced immediate backlash over the management of the fires. Critics alleged that, despite recurring wildfire risk, authorities had not done enough in advance to mitigate the danger.\n\nAmong the issues raised were water supply problems and firefighting resources being stretched or compromised.\n\nMany residents and some local officials have expressed frustration with the slow recovery in the wake of the fires, citing bureaucratic challenges, significant delays with permitting, insurance disputes and infrastructure concerns.\n\nDuring Dye's appearance on the podcast, the comedian and Rogan also slammed celebrities who declared that they would leave the United States if President Donald Trump was elected for a second term.\n\n\"They go, 'I'm going to move.' They make those kind of threats,\" Dye said.\n\n\"Some people do move,\" Rogan pointed out.\n\n\"Yeah, some people do,\" Dye agreed. \"I respect Rosie [O'Donnell] and Ellen [DeGeneres] for that.\"\n\nIn March, O'Donnell said she fled the country with her child Clay on Jan. 15, five days before President Trump's inauguration.\n\nAt the time, the former \"The View\" host said she was living in Ireland and was in the process of applying for Irish citizenship.\n\n\"It's been pretty wonderful, I have to say,\" O'Donnell said in a video on TikTok. \"And the people have been so loving, so kind and so welcoming. And I'm very grateful.\n\n\"Although I was someone who never thought I would move to another country, that's what I decided would be the best for myself and my 12-year-old child.\n\n\"You know, I'm happy. Clay is happy. I miss my other kids. I miss my friends. I miss many things about life there at home, and I'm trying to find a home here in this beautiful country. And when it is safe for all citizens to have equal rights there in America, that's when we will consider coming back.\"\n\nIn November 2024, DeGeneres and wife Portia de Rossi relocated from Montecito, California, to the Cotswolds region in England.\n\nDuring her first UK appearance since relocating, DeGeneres said the move was initially meant to be a part-time getaway but became permanent after Trump's re-election.\n\n\"We got here the day before the election and woke up to lots of texts from our friends with crying emojis, and I was like, 'He got in',\" DeGeneres said, according to the BBC. \"And we're like, 'We're staying here'.\"\n\nWhile speaking with Rogan, Dye said it was \"dumb that they left because now they just can't vote.\"\n\n\"But at least they left,\" he added. \"Hundreds of celebrities said they would leave and didn't.\"",

    "title": "Hilton: Newsom at Climate Summit Shows How Dems 'Ruined California'",
    "body": "California Republican gubernatorial candidate Steve Hilton explained that California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) attending a climate summit in Brazil is the \"perfect encapsulation\" of how the Democrat Party and one party rule in the state has \"ruined\" California.\n\nDuring an appearance on Breitbart News Saturday, Hilton pointed out that while Newsom was attending the United Nation's COP30 Climate Conference to \"lecture everyone about climate change\" the climate policies that he has championed and pushed in California are \"crushing working people.\"\n\n\"It's actually a perfect encapsulation of how this arrogant, corrupt regime in one party rule now for fifteen years has ruined California. All the elements are in this story. So, first of all, you look at the way their policies crush working people,\" Hilton explained, adding that in California, \"The rich get richer, regular working people get screwed.\"\n\n\"He's flying to the Amazon Rainforest to lecture everyone about climate change, to preen in front of the global climate elite -- meanwhile, his own climate policies back in California, are crushing working people, because he is shutting down California's oil and gas industry, which is driving up the cost of gas.\"\n\n\"Even though we have abundant oil, we have higher gas prices in California than anywhere in America, including Hawaii -- in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. Highest gas prices in the country. Who's paying the price for that? It's not Gavin Newsom and his rich friends. It's regular working people who drive their cars and their trucks, two, three, four, five hours a day -- paying the price for that. That's the first point, it's the working class getting screwed by these policies.\"\n\n\"Second, you see the total hypocrisy and emptiness of their policies -- it's all a con. Whatever they say about why they're doing it, and what the benefit is, it's a con because none of this actually helps the climate. Anyway, even if you buy their arguments, even if you go along with everything they say about climate change, none of their policies actually help. It's done nothing for the climate, nothing for global temperatures, at all.\"\n\nHilton added that the \"worst part,\" which showed that the climate policies Newsom and Democrats are advocating for are a \"complete con,\" is that while he's \"lecturing everyone [on] climate change,\" half of the oil that is being drilled in the Amazon Rainforest ends up being sent to California.\n\n\"The final piece of the insanity that this reveals -- their total clueless incompetence and inability to get anything done, because he's out there blaming the wildfires in Los Angeles -- nearly a year ago now, on climate change, instead of what we all know, which was their own ideology, the extreme environmentalism, and then they didn't clear the brush on those hills. They don't manage the forests, so these wildfires burn out of control. And, then the total incompetence in terms of the response and empty reservoirs, and all that -- but, he ignores all of that, and blames it on climate change.\"",

    "title": "Indictment of ex-Newsom aide hints at feds' probe into state's earlier investigation of video game giant",
    "body": "Two of the operatives indicted had ties to the video game company Activision Blizzard, which was investigated eaerlier by the state over sex discrimination allegations.\n\nAn indictment unveiled this week charging Gov. Gavin Newsom's former chief of staff with political corruption threw California's top political circles into chaos -- and stirred speculation in the state capital about what triggered the federal investigation.\n\nAuthorities have not revealed any targets beyond Dana Williamson and two other influential political operatives associated with the state's most powerful Democrats, all of whom are accused of fraud and siphoning campaign funds for personal use.\n\nBut details contained in the indictment and other public records indicate that the FBI and U.S. Deptartment of Justice had a keen interest in Williamson and other operatives involvement in the handling of a legal case involving \"Corporation 1.\" The facts revealed about \"Corporation 1\" match details of a controversial sex discrimination probe that the state of California led into one of the world's largest video game companies, Santa-Monica based Activision Blizzard Inc.\n\nWilliamson -- an influential deal-maker and one of the state's premiere Democratic political consultants before and after she ran Newsom's office -- was arrested on corruption charges on Wednesday. Two longtime associates, lobbyist Greg Campbell, a former high-level staffer in the California Assembly, and Sean McCluskie, a longtime aide to former Atty. Gen. and U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra, have agreed to plead guilty to related charges.\n\nAfter Williamson pleaded not guilty in a tearful court appearance Wednesday, her attorney, McGregor Scott, said that federal authorities had charged his client only after first approaching her to seek help with a probe they were conducting into Newsom, the nature of which remains unclear. Williamson declined to cooperate.\n\nThe governor has not been accused of any wrongdoing. Still, Republicans already are using the indictments to attack Newsom, who has openly said he is considering a run for president in 2028.\n\nWilliamson's attorney did not offer any specifics on what federal officials may have been investigating.\n\nBut numerous threads in the indictment echo details in the Activision saga.\n\nWilliamson and Campbell both worked as advisors to Activision Blizzard, according to financial disclosures on file with the state. Williamson reported receiving income from the company prior to her appointment in Newsom's office, state records show. According to records first filed earlier this year, Campbell disclosed that his lobbying firm started being paid by Activision around the time Williamson joined the governor's office. Activision reported paying $240,000 to his firm in 2023 and 2024. The amount Williamson was paid from Activision was not disclosed.\n\nActivision officials did not respond to emails requesting comment. Lawyers for Williamson, Campbell and McCluskie also did not respond or declined to comment.\n\nThe state's Department of Fair Employment and Housing in 2021 sued Activision Blizzard, which distributes video games such as \"Call of Duty\" and \"Candy Crush,\" alleging that company officials discriminated against women, paid them less than men and ignored reports of egregious sexual harassment.\n\nThe complaint alleged that the company: \"fostered a pervasive \"frat boy\" workplace culture that continues to thrive. In the office, women are subjected to \"cube crawls\" in which male employees drink copious amounts of alcohol as they \"crawl\" their way through various cubicles in the office and often engage in inappropriate behavior toward female employees. Male employees proudly come into work hungover, play video games for long periods of time during work while delegating their responsibilities to female employees, engage in banter about their sexual encounters, talk openly about female bodies, and joke about rape.\"\n\nActivision officials denied the allegations.\n\nThe allegations also were investigated by the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Activision Blizzard agreed to a consent decree, approved in March 2022, with the agency that required the company to set up an $18-million fund for employees who experienced sexual harassment or discrimination, pregnancy discrimination or retaliation.\n\nJust weeks later, the case drew national attention again when the lawyer overseeing the case for the state's Department of Fair Employment and Housing, Janet Wipper, was fired by the Newsom administration, and her chief deputy resigned and alleged that she was doing so to protest interference of Newsom's office in the investigation.\n\n\"The Office of the Governor repeatedly demanded advance notice of litigation strategy and of next steps in the litigation,\" the deputy, Melanie Proctor, wrote to her colleagues. \"As we continued to win in state court, this interference increased, mimicking the interests of Activision's counsel.\"\n\nA member of Activision's board of directors contributed $40,200 for Newsom's 2018 gubernatorial campaign, and an additional $100,000 to a committee opposing the 2021 recall campaign against Newsom -- an effort that failed.\n\nNewsom's office denied it was meddling. \"Claims of interference by our office are categorically false,\" Erin Mellon, Newsom's then-communications director said at the time.\n\nAs case continued to grind through Los Angeles Superior Court, the company stepped up its lobbying presence in Sacramento, according to disclosures filed with the state. Documents show Activision began paying Campbell starting in late 2022 to lobby on its behalf.\n\nAround this time, Newsom announced that he was hiring Williamson to be his chief of staff.\n\nIn December 2023 the state announced it had reached a settlement agreement with Activision for $54 million, with the bulk of the funds going to compensate women who had been underpaid. The company did not admit any wrongdoing.\n\nThe FBI has made inquires about the Activision settlement, though the focus of the inquiry is unclear. When reached last week, Calabasas attorney Alan Goldstein, who handled a sexual harassment suit against Activision, said he received call from an FBI agent looking to probe California's settlement -- but that he couldn't recall a \"substantive conversation.\"\n\nFederal investigators were also looking at how Campbell, Williamson and another Sacramento political consultant, Alexis Podesta, conducted their affairs. In unveiling their charges this week, the U.S. Attorney's office said the investigation began more than three years ago. All three consultants were members of the Sacramento-based Collaborative, a cooperative of top Democratic political operatives.\n\nPodesta from 2017 to 2020 served as secretary of the California Business, Consumer Services and Housing Agency, which included the state's Department of Fair Employment and Housing -- the agency that launched the investigation of Activision in 2018.\n\nWilliamson received a federal subpoena for information about her handling of a government loan her business had received during the pandemic, according to details in the indictment. The indictment accused Williamson of spending vast sums on luxury items -- including a Gucci bag, Chanel earrings and a $150,000 Mexican birthday vacation and party, plus yacht rental and private jet travel -- and then claimed them as business expenses on her taxes.\n\nShe and Campbell had also allegedly conspired with McCluskie to siphon money from Becerra's dormant campaign account to pay McCuskie's wife for a fake, \"no-show\" job working for Williamson. When Williamson went to work for Newsom, the indictment alleges, Podesta took over handling the pass through payments.\n\nBy June 2024, someone in the circle was cooperating with federal investigators and wearing a wire, recording Williamson's private conversations, according to transcripts included in the indictment.\n\nOn Nov.14, 2024, according to the indictment, FBI agents interviewed Williamson, questioning her about the Becerra campaign funds and about the pandemic funds.\n\nInvestigators also asked her about her actions \"while serving in public office to influence the litigation involving the State of California and a former client -Corporation 1,\" according to the indictment. The indictment doesn't identify Corporation 1., but details match the Activision litigation. The indictment notes that Corporation 1 was Williamson's former client and that it was involved in settlement discussions over a lawsuit with the state in 2023. It also references a state lawyer who had been fired in connection with the litigation.\n\nWilliamson, according to the indictment, told the FBI she did not pass any inside information to Campbell or other associates outside the government. But based on their recorded conversations, the indictment said, investigators believed that was not true.\n\nThey alleged that in January 2023, Williamson, shortly after starting as Newsom's chief of staff, revealed to Podesta that she had \"told a high level government attorney to ... get [the case] settled.\"\n\nThe indictment notes that \"Corporation 1\" was not only Williamson's former client, but also now Podesta's current client.\n\nIn June 2024, Williamson complained to Podesta that someone had submitted a California Public Records Act request seeking information about meetings and communications between Newsom officials and the company, according to the indictment.\n\nProctor, the state attorney who resigned in 2022 and had alleged that the Newsom administration was meddling in the Activision case, posted on her Bluesky social media account in July that she had submitted a public records request on May 29, 2024. She also posted the response from Newsom's office, showing a meeting in January 2024 in the governor's office between Williamson, Podesta, and Robert Kotick, the former Chief Executive of Activision.\n\nIn their June conversation, according to the indictment, Williamson told Podesta \"I just wanted to alert you to the PRAS that we're starting to get,\" the indictment stated. (PRAs refer to public records requests.)\n\n\"Yeah. Ugh. F -- her. They really don't know who they are messing with,\" Podesta responded.\n\n\"They really don't,\" Williamson said.\n\nPodesta, who is identified in the indictment as \"Co-Conspirator 2\" was not charged. On Thursday she sent a message to numerous associates offering her take on the situation.\n\n\"While I cannot discuss the details of the ongoing investigation, I want to state plainly that I have always conducted myself -and my business-with integrity.\" She also said that she continued to \"cooperate fully with federal authorities.\"\n\nOn Friday afternoon, McCluskie and Campbell appeared in federal court in Sacramento to be arraigned on conspiracy charges in back-to-back proceedings.\n\nBoth men had previously reached plea agreements with prosecutors, and will be back in court to enter those pleas, Mcluskie in late November and Campbell in early December.\n\nProsecutors did not seek detention for either man, but they were ordered to surrender their passports and avoid associating with other co-conspirators.\n\nIn brief remarks to reporters, Campbell's attorney, Todd Pickles, said that his client \"takes full accountability for his actions\" and would \"in appropriate time further discuss the charges.\" But, Pickles noted, those charges \"do not include Mr. Campbell engaging in advocacy or lobbying on behalf of any client.\"",

    "title": "Newsom Again Avoids Accountability amid Palisades Fire Fallout",
    "body": "Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) is continuing a familiar pattern of shifting attention away from the Pacific Palisades fire, this time focusing on climate change and insurance access instead of addressing his administration's role in the disaster.\n\nAt an event this week, Newsom described California as both \"blessed and cursed\" in terms of climate risk, claiming the state is \"on the tip of the spear of climate change.\" He cited \"simultaneous droughts and simultaneous floods,\" and emphasized that \"the hots are getting a lot hotter\" and \"the dry is drier.\"\n\nIn referencing the Palisades fire, Newsom stated: \"You saw one of the most devastating wildfires in American history in the middle of winter in Los Angeles in January, 100-mile-an-hour winds attached to fire, and as we rebuild, the number one concern people have: how do I get my home insured?\"\n\nNewsom's remarks arrive as victims and lawmakers continue to question his leadership and accountability in the wake of a fire that destroyed nearly 7,000 structures and killed 12 people in the Pacific Palisades and Malibu areas alone. Newsom has faced scrutiny from federal officials, legal challenges from displaced residents, and intense criticism from those who accuse his administration of negligence, obstruction, and policy exploitation in the aftermath of the blaze.\n\nIn the days immediately following the fire, Gov. Newsom deflected responsibility during a visit to the evacuation zone, placing blame on residents who had not yet fled. \"The fact that people were still not evacuated, still did not heed the warning, were just coming down the canyon,\" he remarked, \"is a reminder of how serious this moment is, and how important it is you listen to these evacuation orders.\"\n\nYet reports later revealed that residents had been trapped by gridlock and poor planning. Roads were choked with traffic, and police presence was limited because many officers had been reassigned to protect President Joe Biden during his visit to Los Angeles. Some residents were forced to abandon their vehicles and flee on foot. Fire crews eventually had to clear abandoned cars with bulldozers before engines could reach the flames. Officials also confirmed that fire engines had not been pre-deployed, citing budget restrictions and local leadership decisions.\n\nThe governor's office responded to a lawsuit filed by dozens of residents, arguing that the state was not obligated to monitor the burn scar left by the January 1 Lachman Fire. Although that fire was believed to have been extinguished, it reignited on January 7 under high winds, triggering what became known as the Palisades Fire.\n\nThrough a spokesperson, Newsom dismissed the plaintiffs as \"opportunistic\" and maintained that \"The state didn't start this fire.\" The administration instead pointed to alleged arsonist Jonathan Rinderknecht, whose arrest, according to Newsom, would bring \"closure.\"\n\nHowever, residents and attorneys pushed back. Plaintiffs maintained they had \"smoking gun\" video evidence showing visible smoke on the morning of January 7, hours before high winds fanned the flames. Local attorney Alexander Robertson, who asserted the state \"just didn't do their job\" of monitoring the fire site, added, \"He threw the firefighters under the bus. He took no responsibility.\"\n\nAdvocates and victims also pushed back on the notion that the fire was unpreventable. Spencer Pratt, who lost his home in the fire and has since become a vocal opponent of the state's response, said the community could have been spared if basic preventative measures had been taken. Pratt specifically pointed to the failure to clear brush in Topanga State Park, where the fire reportedly reignited. While acknowledging there may have been issues on federally managed land as well, Pratt stressed that Newsom was directly at fault for neglecting the state-managed property where the disaster started.",

    "title": "Charlotte braces for federal immigration enforcement as murder rate rises 200% in uptown area",
    "body": "U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi explains why the Department of Justice sued California Gov. Gavin Newsom and how the legal system handles alleged 'sanctuary cities' on 'Hannity.'\n\nFederal agents from U.S. Customs and Border Protection are expected to arrive in the Charlotte area within days, local officials confirmed this week amid growing friction between Washington's immigration enforcement priorities and Democratic-run cities.\n\nThe Mecklenburg County Sheriff's Office said Wednesday that it had been notified of the impending federal presence but emphasized that it has not been asked to assist or participate in any operations. A department spokesperson told Fox News Digital Friday that the sheriff's office had \"zero involvement or participation in any CBP immigration enforcements or operations.\"\n\nThe impending immigration enforcement in North Carolina comes as Sheriff Garry L. McFadden, a Democrat, has sought to maintain open communication with federal agencies while distancing his department from federal immigration enforcement.\n\nGOP URGES DEMOCRAT GOVERNOR TO DEPLOY NATIONAL GUARD TO CHARLOTTE AS CRIME SURGES\n\nCharlotte's anticipated CBP deployment is the latest in a series of similar moves by the federal government to extend border-security operations to other parts of the country.\n\nIn recent months, CBP and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) have sent personnel to major metropolitan areas including Chicago and Washington, D.C.\n\nThose operations have sparked protests from anti-immigration activists. In Portland, Oregon, protests have flared since June. Anti-ICE graffiti has been scrawled outside of detention centers, and demonstrations have become violent at times between protesters and federal agents.\n\nWATCH: Federal immigration agents dodge bullets, speeding cars in CA\n\nFederal officials have described the deployments as part of an expanded effort to disrupt smuggling networks and track illegal aliens.\n\nIn a statement to Fox News Digital, Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said: \"Every day, DHS enforces the laws of the nation across the country. We do not discuss future or potential operations.\"\n\nThe timing of the announcement comes as Charlotte faces intensifying scrutiny over violent crime.\n\nHomicides and aggravated assaults have risen sharply this year, prompting Republican lawmakers to urge Democratic Gov. Josh Stein to deploy the National Guard. For now, the governor has resisted that call from Republican lawmakers, and local officials have argued that public safety remains a local responsibility.\n\n\"Recently, the city faced eight homicides in seven days. The murder rate in uptown Charlotte is now 200% higher than it was a year ago,\" a letter from a trio of Republican lawmakers said. \"According to the Fraternal Order of Police, aggravated assaults involving knives or guns have risen from 86 in 2024 to 111 in 2025, and personal strong-arm robberies have increased from 26 to 31 in the same period.\"\n\nMAJOR CITY POLICE UNIONS SUPPORT FEDERAL TROOP DEPLOYMENTS, BUT LOCAL LEADERS ARE PUSHING BACK\n\nAccording to the Charlotte Police Department's quarterly statistics report, violent crimes, commercial burglaries and larcenies from automobiles have all gone up in Charlotte since last year. But other crimes like homicides, rapes, property crimes and arson have come down modestly from levels in 2024. In many categories, Charlotte's current crime levels are meaningfully lower than rates in 2022 and 2023, with some exceptions.\n\nOn Aug. 22, the stabbing of Ukrainian refugee Iryna Zarutska garnered attention after her killing was captured on surveillance video while she was commuting home from her pizzeria job. The footage captured the 23-year-old cowering as her alleged killer leered over her with a folding knife seconds before the attack.\n\nPolice revealed that her accused killer was identified as Decarlos Brown Jr., a repeat offender with a lengthy rap sheet.\n\nIn his earlier statement Wednesday, McFadden sought to reassure residents that his office \"remains committed to transparency\" and that any coordination with federal agencies will be limited to information-sharing, not enforcement.\n\nCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"It allows us to stay informed and be proactive in keeping Mecklenburg County safe and to maintain the level of trust our community deserves,\" McFadden said.",

    "body": "Two high-ranking men in California politics were arraigned on felony conspiracy charges in federal court on Friday.\n\nThere are five co-conspirators in the bombshell case of political corruption and fraud.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom's former chief of staff, Dana Williamson, was the first to be charged on Wednesday, indicted on 23 fraud-related charges.\n\nSean McCluskie and Greg Campbell both entered not guilty pleas Friday in court, though they are expected to change their pleas to guilty at their upcoming court hearings over the next three weeks.\n\nPlea agreements are already on file for both men.\n\nThe fraud case alleges the five co-conspirators defrauded the federal government and took hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign money to line their own pockets.\n\nAfter the court hearing on Friday, McCluskie and his attorney declined to give a comment to reporters.\n\nCampbell's attorney, Todd Pickles, however, provided a statement and took no questions.\n\n\"Mr. Campbell takes full accountability for his actions and is cooperating fully with the legal process,\" Pickles said in part.\n\nThe alleged kingpin, and the only person not cooperating according to prosecutors, is Williamson.\n\nWilliamson allegedly subscribed to false tax returns, claiming more than $1 million in business deductions that prosecutors said were for personal and nondeductible expenditures, like private jet travel, hotel stays, home furnishings and designer handbags.\n\nShe is also accused of illegally obtaining COVID-era PPP loans and helping funnel Xavier Becerra's campaign money to McCluskie.\n\nMcCluskie is the former chief of staff for Becerra.\n\nBecerra previously served as both California Attorney General and the United States Health and Human Services Secretary. He is currently running for California governor.\n\nFederal court documents allege that, unknown to Becerra, McCluskie stole $225 thousand worth of Becerra's dormant campaign funds for his personal use.\n\nWilliamson is alleged to have helped facilitate it alongside Campbell, a high-profile political consultant. Court documents allege Campbell coordinated the theft through his companies and helped cover it up.\n\n\"Mr. Campbell will, at the appropriate time, further discuss the charges, which do not include Mr. Campbell engaging in the advocacy or lobbying on behalf of any client, receiving any loans to Mr. Campbell or any company owned by Mr. Campbell, or Mr. Campbell profiting from the charged conduct,\" said Pickles on behalf of his client.\n\nBoth men are expected to plead guilty and potentially testify against Williamson for a lesser punishment for their alleged crimes if her case goes to trial.\n\n\"I continue to think the case is extraordinary,\" said Michael Wise, a Sacramento defense attorney unrelated to this case. \"It's the misuse of donated funds for people who believed in the candidate, Mr. Becerra. So I think it's really important for the community that the case has been brought.\"\n\nThe drama in the courtroom could involve top brass in California politics if Williamson faces a jury trial.\n\n\"Is there a scenario where you could see Gov. Gavin Newsom and Xavier Becerra be subpoenaed to testify in a trial?\" I asked Wise.\n\n\"Absolutely, absolutely. Especially Mr. Becerra and potentially the Governor. He would have no right to refuse, as far as I can tell, because it's a federal jurisdiction and he is a state employee,\" said Wise.\n\nThe federal court documents allege Becerra did not know anything about the scheme and nothing at this time suggests Newsom had any knowledge either of Williamson's wrongdoing.\n\nThe Governor's office placed Williamson on leave in November 2024, when they first learned she was under criminal investigation.\n\nMcCluskie will be back in court on Nov. 20 for a change of plea hearing.",

    "body": "Gov. Gavin Newsom's critics took a victory lap this week when California revoked 17,000 Commercial Drivers Licenses it had issued to migrant truck drivers whose legal permission to be in the United States ended before the CDLs' expiration dates.\n\nYet the Golden State may still be defying federal law: Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy called the 17,000 the \"tip of the iceberg,\" warning that Team Trump will keep investigating Cali for issuing CDLs to illegal migrants or to drivers who flunked English proficiency exams.\n\nCase in point: Video seems to show Harjinder Singh ignoring signs barring a U-turn on the Florida Turnpike before the deadly crash that killed three in August.\n\nInvestigators said that he had received CDLs in Washington state and California, despite failing the tests several times.\n\nHe also failed an English proficiency test after the crash. (He entered the country illegally in 2018; California claims he later obtained legal status.)\n\nCertainly, the state is still openly defying President Donald Trump's August executive order requiring English proficiency for CDLs: Newsom ordered the California Highway Patrol to ignore it.\n\nThat led Duffy to pull $40 million in federal highway funding; he threatens to withhold $160 million more for not enforcing other new rules.\n\nIn the Biden years, Cali handed out CDLs easily, casting its lax standards as a way of securing US supply chains in the wake of the pandemic.\n\nNewsom's office boasted in 2021 of \"issuing 60 percent more CDLs this year compared to last\" thanks to Biden administration cooperation in cutting \"bureaucratic red tape.\"\n\nSometimes -- especially in California -- red tape makes life impossible. But some rules exist to save lives.\n\nAs governor, Newsom has the power to choose which rules to enforce and which to ignore. He wants to crack down on gas-powered trucks -- but not on drivers who can't read road signs and shouldn't even be in the country.\n\nHe had to be dragged into enforcing the law.\n\nNewsom's belated decision to cut 17,000 CDLs is an admission of bad policy, perhaps with an eye on avoiding queries on the presidential campaign trail about why he let illegal aliens who can't speak English turn 18-wheelers loose on the roads.\n\nThat, and Duffy's threat to withhold funds, are the only reasons Gavin is finally doing the right thing.",

    "title": "Gavin discovers men, Canada's tortured talk on killing and other...",
    "body": "California Gov. Gavin Newsom told CNN Democrats \"ceded ground\" on the \"struggles\" of young men and \"it has cost them electorally.\" Michael Bahareen at UnHerd agrees: \"Democrats, especially liberal Democrats, often seem uncomfortable speaking to the plight of men.\" Newsom seeks to address how men are \"now falling behind women\" in many areas, but many Democrats still believe that \"men remain widely more 'privileged' than women\" and that \"traditional masculinity\" is \"problematic.\" Newsom warns: \"We can't afford, from an electoral perspective, to lose these folks.\" Cautions Bahareen: Newsom provides \"a good model for other Democrats\" by meeting \"young men where they are\" and showing \"he cares about them\" -- but that won't do much unless you \"offer them more than just words.\"\n\nFrom the left: Canada's Tortured Talk on Killing\n\n\"Linguistic tap-dancing\" around the killing of 300 diseased ostriches in Canada would've been \"less unnerving,\" suggests Racket's Matt Taibbi, had it not so clearly echoed \"Canada's aggressive word-twisting during the Covid pandemic,\" as well as its \"more recent literary inventions around the country's euthanasia craze.\" In 2021, Canada \"opened the door on mass Kevorkianism\" by increasing eligibility for assisted suicide to include people with a \"grievous and irremediable medical condition,\" as opposed to the imminently dying. \"In a flash, assisted suicide\" became one of Canada's leading causes of death. Now, as \"moral arguments against suicide have mostly vanished,\" Canada is \"scheduled to begin allowing euthanasia/suicide/assisted dying for people suffering from mental illness only.\"\n\nShutdown journal: The Dems' Real 'Base'\n\n\"A government shutdown, as Clausewitz didn't quite say, is the continuation of politics by other means,\" snarks The Wall Street Journal's Barton Swaim. The one that just ended proves it. After all, Obamacare \"premium increases without the subsidies\" certainly weren't \"worth the political risk of a five-week shutdown.\" Rather, the \"stunt\" was meant to show the Dems' base they're ready to fight. Sen. Chuck Schumer feared a primary challenge, perhaps from AOC. Yet the \"base\" isn't rank-and-file Democrats so much as \"cash-flush foundations, unions and activist groups\": the American Civil Liberties Union, the teachers unions, Black Lives Matters, etc. Republicans have nothing similar. And though it may be somewhat true that Republicans cater to President Trump's whims, he'll \"leave office in three years. Progressive nonprofits aren't going anywhere.\"\n\nDefense watch: Our Military-Recruiting U-Turn\n\nThe US military's recruiting shortfall, \"which by 2023 had become a critical national security crisis,\" has turned a corner, cheer the editors of National Review. In fiscal year 2025, \"the Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Space Force all reached their recruiting goals,\" with the Army surpassing it \"four months before the deadline.\" \"There's no doubt\" Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's \"telegenic public-relations focus on lethality, fitness, and 'the warrior ethos'\" has attracted some of the new recruits. But the 2025 National Defense Authorization Act \"surely also had an impact\" by raising \"the base pay of junior enlisted personnel.\" Plus, \"the services began experimenting\" with a \"pre-boot-camp prep course\" that has \"successfully allowed recruits who don't meet the minimum physical or academic standards\" to \"take the very first step of the ladder to a military career.\"\n\nFrom the right: DSA Dizzy After Triumph\n\nEven as the Democratic Socialists of America \"seems poised for a political breakthrough, it shows signs of unraveling,\" smirks Stu Smith at City Journal: Its members are \"intensely divided over whether\" Zohran Mamdani's victory represents \"an electoral success or capitulation to the status quo.\" Various caucuses within the DSA alternately think \"Mamdani is too mainstream,\" while \"others see the mayor-elect as a revolutionary.\" Some radical members even \"believe that Mamdani has become too conservative and friendly to Israel,\" and have dubbed him \"ZIOhran.\" So \"fractured\" is the DSA that Mamdani's \"ideological allies cannot agree on the purpose of his mayoralty, or even whether it's worthwhile.\"",

    "title": "Rogan and Carolla shred Newsom, say he should blame Palisades fire on bad management, not climate change",
    "body": "Comedian and podcaster Joe Rogan and Adam Carolla slammed California Gov. Gavin Newsom for his management of California, arguing it was absurd for him to blame climate change for the deadly Palisades wildfires instead of bad management.\n\nJoe Rogan and comedian Adam Carolla criticized California Gov. Gavin Newsom Friday for his rhetoric about climate change, arguing he should blame the Palisades wildfires on poor management by local leaders instead.\n\nNearly a year after the Palisades wildfires became an international news story, critics are still blasting state leaders, accusing them of failing to sufficiently prepare for or competently respond to the fires.\n\n\"The thing about the fires is like, you know, Gavin Newsom's like, 'Oh, climate change,' you know, just blame everything on climate change, which is insane,\" Carolla said on \"The Joe Rogan Experience\" podcast.\n\nNEWSOM PUSHES CLIMATE RECORD ABROAD AS CALIFORNIANS SHOULDER AMERICA'S HIGHEST GAS COSTS\n\n\"That was hilarious,\" Rogan agreed. The podcaster has long criticized California's political leadership, particularly Newsom himself.\n\nCarolla touted New Orleans and Las Vegas as examples of places where people have managed to circumvent the forces of nature to create bustling cities, arguing that California shows it can endure natural disasters like earthquakes thanks to its local codes and rules for buildings.\n\n\"So you can mitigate any of this stuff,\" he said.\n\nBut while California is prepared for earthquakes, local leaders have been repeatedly accused of failing to adequately prepare for the Palisades wildfires.\n\n\"So we did not prepare for the fires. We didn't clear the brush. We didn't fill the reservoirs. We didn't do all the stuff,\" Carolla continued. \"And Newsom goes 'climate change.'\"\n\nLA COMEDIAN CALLS NEWSOM AN 'EMPTY SUIT' THAT ALLOWED THE CITY TO BE BURNED DOWN\n\nRogan agreed, saying Los Angeles has long had the same dry climate and has always faced major fires.\n\n\"LA has always caught fire,\" he said. \"It doesn't rain there. It doesn't rain there ever. And it's been like that forever. That's why they film movies there. It's not climate change, you f------ a------. It's a lack of preparation,\" Rogan said.\n\nCarolla also mocked claims of rapidly rising sea levels, arguing that if they were true, much of the oceanfront property in Los Angeles that has been there since the 1930s and 40s would have been submerged.\n\n\"It's a weird thing because people in California talk about climate change, but the lots that are on the ocean side of PCH are 10 million bucks more than the ones that are up the hill that would be safe from the ocean that was rising,\" he said.\n\nNewsom's office has objected to Rogan and Carolla's claims, which it describes as \"factually inaccurate.\"\n\n\"It is factually inaccurate to say there was a lack of preparation - resources were prepositioned thanks to alerts from the National Weather Service. You can see the historic response by the day here,\" a spokesperson for Newsom's office wrote, linking to a lengthy list of Newsom's efforts, including cutting red tape to streamline the process of rebuilding what was lost.\n\n\"Additionally, it is well-known that there were significant winds (up to 100mph in places) driving embers (seen here) as well as historically dry grounds due to lack of rain fall for a significant period of time (as documented here).\"",

    "title": "Foul-mouthed, brash and savvy: What to know about ex-Newsom aide tangled in a corruption probe",
    "body": "The indictment threatens to complicate Newsom's national trajectory as he challenges Trump, though the governor himself is not implicated.\n\nThe FBI was secretly listening last year when a high-ranking advisor to Gov. Gavin Newsom unleashed a stream of profanities as she vented about a public records request from an unnamed individual.\n\n\"Double f -- her!\" said Dana Williamson, Newsom's chief of staff, repeating the f word throughout the conversation. She also called another person an \"a -- ,\" according to federal court documents made public this week.\n\nBefore Wednesday, few people outside of California's political bubble likely knew Williamson's name.\n\nNow she's engulfed in a scandal involving political consultants and illicit payments that threatens to haunt her former boss, Newsom, as he challenges President Trump and looks toward the 2028 presidential race.\n\nA smart and savvy negotiator who bridged Sacramento's overlapping worlds of government, business and labor, Williamson is also someone who picked unnecessary fights and launched cruel missives, political consultants and friends said this week.\n\nFederal agents arrested Williamson Wednesday at her home in Carmichael, a Sacramento suburb. Her lawyer, former U.S. Atty. McGregor Scott, was furious about how the arrest was handled, saying she was seriously ill and in need of a liver transplant.\n\nFederal prosecutors allege that she conspired to funnel money out of one of her one-time client's state campaign accounts for bogus services, and falsified documents related to her COVID loan.\n\nShe also is accused of lying on her tax returns about luxury items and services, including a $150,000 birthday trip to Mexico, that she allegedly sought to pass off as business expenses, according to the government.\n\nWilliamson, who pleaded not guilty to the charges this week, appeared in a courtroom in Sacramento. She appeared solemn during the hearing, at one point reportedly lifting her cuffed hand to wipe away a tear, and left without talking to reporters.\n\nCourt documents filed this week paint an image of both a conniving player and a fragile individual. \"I'm scared,\" she wrote in a February 2022 text message to a colleague as they discussed the alleged money-laundering scheme, which was allegedly in the early planning stages.\n\nPublic affairs consultant Steven Maviglio has known her since the two worked in President Clinton's administration -- and then later the administration of Gov. Gray Davis. He is now trying to put together a legal defense fund for her.\n\nHe described Williamson as a \"no nonsense, no BS, get it done\" person who was \"straight-talking, sometimes to the point of offensive to people.\"\n\nShe regularly dropped f-bombs, he added.\n\nIn another recording captured by the FBI, Williamson joined two colleagues last year in a restaurant near the state Capitol in Sacramento. The government was asking questions about money she received through her COVID loan.\n\nShe complained about the \"f -- \" drama and said her Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loan got \"popped\" -- before adding another swear word. According to federal officials, she created false contracts in an attempt to show the COVID money was appropriately used.\n\nThere is little sympathy from her detractors. Gil Duran, the former press secretary to Gov. Jerry Brown, who worked alongside Williamson, likened her to a \"mafia boss\" in an interview with CNN. She also has numerous defenders in Sacramento, many of them women, who view her as a tough and inspiring figure.\n\nThe details in the federal filings sent shock waves beyond Sacramento and the state Capitol this week.\n\n\"I'm stunned about the allegation and find it hard to believe,\" said Alison Gaulden, who supervised Williamson when she worked as an associate vice president of public affairs for Planned Parenthood Mar Monte from 2002-04.\n\nGaulden described her as \"incredibly bright and well versed in policy. I've admired how she grew in her career.\"\n\nWilliamson, who grew up in Santa Rosa, moved between the private and public sectors, and was employed by three governors, Davis, Jerry Brown and Newsom.\n\nAt Pacific Gas and Electric Co. (PG&E), she worked alongside two other women who would be remarkably influential in her life: Nancy McFadden, the late advisor to Brown and Alexis Podesto, a longtime California political insider who also appears in the federal court documents filed this week.\n\nPodesta is the person identified as \"Co-Conspirator 2,\" but has not been charged and is cooperating with investigators, according to her attorney.\n\nWilliamson was hired as a senior advisor for Brown and was later promoted to Cabinet secretary.\n\nWhile working for Brown, Williamson publicly advocated for children's health, testifying in favor of legislation that would eliminate the state's personal-belief exemption for childhood vaccines. She said the issue was meaningful to her because she was a mother of four.\n\n\"Usually, staff doesn't speak on bills, the great thing about the governor is that he respects that we are people first,\" Williamson told the San Francisco Chronicle. \"This was important to me.\"\n\nBusiness advocates appreciated her direct approach when she worked for Brown.\n\n\"She was very straightforward, she was a good person to work with,\" said Stuart Waldman, president of Valley Industry and Commerce Assn. He said he hadn't dealt with her in years.\n\nShe flip-flopped between private and government work, drawing criticism from groups like Consumer Watchdog for her \"revolving door\" career.\n\nIn one episode, she was allegedly seen negotiating for her energy clients in Brown's office as the state hammered out details over a grid deal, drawing outrage from the watchdog group.\n\nShe started her own government relations firm, Grace Public Affairs, which handled an array of campaigns, including the online sports betting initiative Proposition 27, which appeared on the 2022 ballot, but failed to pass.\n\nHer clients included California Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara, and former Atty. Gen. Xavier Becerra, whose campaign fund was allegedly raided by Williamson, and others.\n\nBy 2017, she had a close group of female friends, who had also risen to the top of their professions. But to those who weren't in her inner circle, she was all elbows, one political insider said this week.\n\nAt the California Democratic Party headquarters in downtown Sacramento, a bronze statue of Williamson's then-5-year-old daughter was installed as part of a campaign to promote female empowerment following Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's 2016 loss.\n\nThose behind the statue included Williamson's friends Robin Swanson, a Democratic communications consultant, and Angie Tate, then a chief fundraiser for the California Democratic Party.\n\nThe installation was intended to mimic the \"Fearless Girl\" statue at New York's Wall Street, which shows a 4-foot young woman looking defiantly at the famous charging bull statue.\n\nIn 2022, Newsom's office announced Williamson was joining his office as chief of staff. Though the two weren't particularly close when she joined, she quickly became part of his inner circle, Politico reported at the time.\n\nAnthony York, Newsom's former communications director and a former L.A. Times reporter, told Politico at the time that Williamson was not intimidated by the governor's celebrity status. \"She gives zero f -- s, which is part of what makes her so great,\" York said.\n\nDuring her time in Newsom's office, she worked with former Senate leader Darrell Steinberg on the successful passage of Proposition 1, which borrows billions of dollars for mental health services, and was a personal issue for her family.\n\n\"I had a particularly tough experience with my husband that I learned a lot from... when the incident happened with him, I learned about all the holes in the system,\" she told KQED.\n\nShe moved from Elk Grove last year to Carmichael, purchasing a home for $1.695 million, according to property records. The records show her linked to several homes in Elk Grove, including one that went into foreclosure in 2012.\n\nWilliamson would send off combative messages, including social media posts or texts, often at night. Among her targets: California Labor Federation President Lorena Gonzalez and U.S. Rep. Kevin Kiley (R-Rocklin), whom she called an \"entertaining idiot\" on X.\n\nShe took aim at former Assemblymember Kevin McCarty during his campaign last year for Sacramento mayor. She called him a \"devil\" on X and urged others not to vote for him, before her comment was taken down a few days later.\n\nNewsom placed Williamson on leave when she informed him last year she was under criminal investigation. Her last day in office was in November 2024. At the time, the governor said in a statement that \"her insight, tenacity, and big heart will be missed.\"\n\nThis week, a spokesperson for the governor struck a different tone: \"Ms. Williamson no longer serves in this administration. While we are still learning details of the allegations, the Governor expects all public servants to uphold the highest standards of integrity.\"",

I will always be here, you can count on me.\"\n\nGuilfoyle was married to Newsom between 2001 and 2005 and then was wedded to Villency between 2006 and 2009.\n\nAn email to Newsom's office seeking comment was not immediately returned Friday.\n\nThe Trump ally officially took office as the first woman to serve as American ambassador to Greece this month.\n\n\"I know we will do amazing things for these two exceptional countries,\" she told attendees at an early November welcome reception. \"I will not disappoint the United States of America. I shall not disappoint Greece.\"\n\nShe entered Trump's inner-circle initially when she started dating the president's eldest son, Don Jr. in 2018.\n\nThe pair got engaged on New Year's Eve 2020, but the end of their relationship was revealed in December 2024.\n\nTrump soon nominated Guilfoyle to her diplomatic role, and on Thursday Guilfoyle vowed to work on issues connected to the president's agenda and strengthen relations between Greece and the United States.",

    "title": "Newsom pushes climate record abroad as Californians shoulder America's highest gas costs",
    "body": "Fox News anchor John Roberts speaks with strategist Katie Zacharia and commentator Natalie Beisner about California Governor Gavin Newsom's climate plans and the effects of high energy prices on 'America Reports'.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom is in the midst of touting his state's leadership on energy policies while in Brazil for a United Nations climate conference, while Golden State residents pay the highest gas prices in the nation that are largely attributable to state regulations.\n\n\"While climate change may not resonate, I think affordability matters,\" Newsom said in an interview with the San Francisco Chronicle earlier in November ahead of his trip to Brazil. \"When you talk about energy efficiency, you're talking about saving money.\"\n\nNewsom joined the COP30 summit, which is an annual U.N. climate meeting, in Belém, Brazil. Typically, federal U.S. officials attend the summit, but the administration skipped the event as President Donald Trump rails against climate change as \"the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world.\"\n\nNEWSOM VOWS TO BLOCK TRUMP'S REPORTED ENERGY PLAN IN CALIFORNIA, EXPERTS PUSH BACK\n\n\"Absolutely,\" Newsom said Wednesday when asked if California was standing in for the U.S. at the summit, the Los Angeles Times reported. \"And I think the world sees us in that light, as a stable partner, a historic partner ... in the absence of American leadership. And not just absence of leadership, the doubling down of stupid in terms of global leadership on clean energy.\"\n\nThe governor's office touted amid the trip that \"Greenhouse gas emissions in California are down 21% since 2000 -- even as the state's GDP increased 81% in that same time period,\" and that \"the state was powered by two-thirds clean energy\" in 2023.\n\nCalifornia currently has the highest average gas prices in the nation, data shows.\n\nThe Golden State has long had notoriously high gas prices, and 2025 is no different. California currently has the highest average gas prices in the nation, at an average of $4.67 per gallon, followed by a list of other states, including Hawaii, Washington, Nevada and Oregon.\n\nHoliday travel is about to hit a fever pitch across the country as the aviation industry gets back on its feet following the historically long government shutdown that led to nationwide delays -- with many travelers expected to hop in their cars for a road trip this Thanksgiving and Christmas season.\n\nLONGTIME NEWSOM CRITIC PUTS UN SUMMIT ON NOTICE IF DEM GOVERNOR IS ALLOWED TO SPEAK: 'CLIMATE HYPOCRISY'\n\nThe White House slammed California's high gas prices to Fox News Digital Thursday while Newsom was abroad.\n\n\"Governor Newscum is working overtime to cement his status as the worst governor in America,\" White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers told Fox News Digital. \"Under his failed leadership, the great state of California is suffering with some of the highest gas and electricity prices in the country.\"\n\n\"In fact, California drivers pay $1.60 more than the national average for a gallon of gasoline,\" she added. \"Gavin, it's time to abandon your failed Green New Scam experiment and embrace President Trump's successful energy dominance agenda.\"\n\nNewsom office spokesperson Izzy Gardon told Fox Digital on Thursday that current gas prices in the state are lower than in 2019, when Newsom was inaugurated California's top leader.\n\n\"Year over year, in real dollars, gas prices in California today are lower than they were in the Governor's first year in office -- and Californians are getting up to $60 billion in utility bill rebates thanks to climate policies Trump is too lazy or too stupid to understand,\" Gardon said. \"While Trump tries to Make Black Lung Great Again, Governor Newsom is in Brazil fighting for clean energy, more jobs, and a livable planet.\"\n\nThe nation's average gas price has fallen in recent months, sitting at about $3.08 as of Thursday, after reaching a high of $5 per gallon in the summer of 2022 under the Biden administration, according to Gas Buddy data.\n\nRed states currently report the lowest prices, including Oklahoma touting the lowest average price in the nation, at a state average of $2.48 per gallon, followed by four other red states with low gas averages: Mississippi, Arkansas, Louisiana and Texas.\n\nNEWSOM CLAIMS TRUMP IS 'HANDING THE FUTURE TO CHINA' AT BRAZILIAN CLIMATE CONFAB THAT WH SKIPPED\n\nThe U.S. Energy Information Administration, which is the Department of Energy's statistical arm that publishes policy-independent data, attributed California's higher prices at the pump to a spate of policies, including state taxes and fees, environmental requirements, and special fuel requirements.\n\nCalifornians pay an extra $0.90 per gallon in local, state, and federal taxes as of March 2025, while the California Energy Commission estimated that residents pay an additional $0.54 a gallon in environmental compliance costs. The state also requires that fuel in the state be a special blend that cuts back on pollution, but also comes at a higher price tag, according to the Energy Information Administration.\n\nNEWSOM SET TO RALLY TEXAS DEMS WITH VICTORY LAP DAYS AFTER PROP 50 PASSES: 'CALIFORNIA STEPPED UP'\n\nNewsom and Trump long have been political foes, with their battles frequently focusing on energy policy, including Trump slamming Newsom over its water reserves in a state prone to devastating wildfires, and Trump signing a trio of congressional resolutions ending California's restrictive rules for diesel engines and mandates on elective vehicle sales in July.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nFox News Digital reached out to Newsom's office for comment on the matter but did not immediately receive a response.",

    "title": "Court blocks new rules limiting which immigrants can get commercial drivers' licenses - The Boston Globe",
    "body": "The court said the federal government didn't follow proper procedure in drafting the rule and failed to \"articulate a satisfactory explanation for how the rule would promote safety.\" The court said the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration's own data shows that immigrants who hold these licenses account for roughly 5 percent of all commercial driver's licenses but only about 0.2 percent of all fatal crashes, the court said.\n\nDuffy has been pressing this issue in California because the driver in the Florida crash received a license in California, and an audit of that state's records showed that many immigrants received licenses in California that were valid long after their work permits expired. Earlier this week, California revoked 17,000 commercial driver's licenses because of that problem.\n\nNeither Duffy nor California Governor Gavin Newsom responded immediately Friday to questions about the ruling. Newsom's office has said the state followed guidance it received from the US Department of Homeland Security about issuing these licenses to noncitizens.\n\nDuffy has said the Florida crash, along with fatal truck crashes in Texas and Alabama earlier this year, highlighted questions about these licenses. A fiery California crash that killed three people last month involved a truck driver in the country illegally, only adding to the concerns.\n\nThe new restrictions on these licenses would only allow immigrants who hold three specific classes of visas to be eligible to get the licenses. States would also have to verify an applicant's immigration status in a federal database. The licenses would be valid for up to one year unless the applicant's visa expires sooner.\n\nUnder the new rules, only 10,000 of the 200,000 noncitizens who have commercial licenses would qualify for them, which would only be available to drivers who have an H-2a, H-2b or E-2 visa. H-2a is for temporary agricultural workers while H-2b is for temporary nonagricultural workers, and E-2 is for people who make substantial investments in a US business. But the rules won't be enforced retroactively, so those 190,000 drivers would be allowed to keep their commercial licenses at least until they come up for renewal.\n\nDuffy has said that California and five other states had improperly issued commercial driver's licenses to noncitizens, but California is the only state Duffy has taken action against because it was the first one where an audit was completed. The reviews in the other states have been delayed by the government shutdown, but the Transportation Department is urging all of them to tighten their standards.",

    "title": "These California counties won by Trump in 2024 supported Prop. 50 in the special election. Here's what to know",
    "body": "Richard Ramos is a web producer for CBS Sacramento who was born and raised in Sacramento. He graduated with a BA in Journalism from CSUS.\n\nA majority of voters in seven California counties won by President Trump in 2024 also supported Proposition 50 in a special election earlier this month, helping pass the redistricting measure championed by Gov. Gavin Newsom and legislative Democrats.\n\nData show that ballots cast to approve Prop. 50 -- which passed with 64% of the vote -- outnumbered \"no\" votes in Fresno, Imperial, Lake, Merced, Riverside, San Bernardino and San Joaquin counties, each of which was carried by Mr. Trump in the last presidential election. No California counties that voted for Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election voted no on Proposition 50, according to data from the California Secretary of State's Office (SOS) for both elections.\n\nProp. 50 temporarily redraws five of the state's Republican-held congressional districts to make them more favorable to being won by Democrats in the 2026 midterms. It was placed on the ballot by Democratic lawmakers hoping to offset redistricting efforts in Texas that flipped five Democratic districts to Republican.\n\nAccording to the measure, the nonpartisan California Citizens Redistricting Commission will resume drawing the state's congressional maps after the 2030 U.S. Census.\n\nIt remains unclear why a majority of voters in the seven counties Trump won cast their ballots in support of Prop. 50. An October CBS News poll conducted before the election found that 75% of the likely voters surveyed who planned to vote for Prop. 50 said one of the reasons they were doing so was to oppose Mr. Trump. Seventy percent of likely voters polled who were voting \"yes\" on the measure said another reason they were doing so was to oppose national Republicans.\n\nHere's what to know about the California counties where most voters approved Prop. 50:\n\nFresno County, the second-most-populous county in California's Central Valley, voted for a Republican in a presidential election for the first time in 20 years in 2024, with 51% of the vote going to Mr. Trump, according to the California Secretary of State's (SOS) Office.\n\nIn the Nov. 4 special election, 51% of Fresno County voters said \"Yes\" to Prop. 50, according to state data as of Nov. 12, narrowly surpassing the 49% of voters who rejected the measure.\n\nSitting on the southern border, Imperial County is 85% Latino, according to 2023 U.S. Census data. In the 2024 presidential election, Mr. Trump won the county with 49% of the vote, according to data from the SOS, making him the first Republican presidential candidate to do so since 1988.\n\nIn the Nov. 4 special election, 60% of Imperial County voters approved Proposition 50, as of Nov. 12.\n\nLake County, which contains Clear Lake and a portion of California's Wine Country, voted Republican last year in a presidential election for the first time since Ronald Reagan carried the county in 1984.\n\nMr. Trump narrowly won the county in 2024. Proposition 50 passed there with 52% of the vote, as of Nov. 12.\n\nThe Central Valley's Merced County has started leaning more conservative in recent years. After voting Democrat in every presidential election since 2008, the county voted to recall Newsom in 2021 and voted against him in 2022.\n\nIn the 2024 presidential election, 51% of the vote went to Mr. Trump. The county approved Proposition 50 with 54% of voters saying yes, as of Nov. 13.\n\nDemocrats won Riverside County in presidential elections from 2008 to 2020. But in 2024, Mr. Trump narrowly defeated then-Vice President Kamala Harris, receiving 49% to 48%.\n\n\"Yes\" on Prop. 50, however, received 56% of the vote in Riverside County, as of Nov. 12.\n\nTwo of the Republicans who are impacted by Proposition 50, Reps. Ken Calvert and Darrell Issa, currently represent districts that include portions of Riverside County. Calvert's district is entirely within Riverside County, while Issa's current district includes portions of Riverside and San Diego counties.\n\nSan Bernardino County held steady in presidential elections, voting Democratic from 2008 to 2020 before going for Mr. Trump in 2024.\n\nProp. 50 passed with 57% of the vote, as of Nov. 13, marking a significant change from Mr. Trump's 50% in last year's election.\n\nMr. Trump earned a narrow victory in San Joaquin County in 2024 with 48.69% of the vote, edging out Harris by about 2,000 of the more than 264,000 votes cast. He was the first Republican presidential candidate to carry the county since George W. Bush in 2004.",

    "title": "Williamson indictment devours Sacramento",
    "body": "CAPITOL QUAKE -- The indictment of Gavin Newsom's former chief of staff Dana Williamson has exposed fractures in Sacramento's once-tight political circles.\n\nPeople in Williamson's camp are furious with longtime Sacramento consultant Alexis Podesta. She was the second of two unnamed co-conspirators mentioned in the indictment, her attorney Bill Portanova confirmed to Playbook. Portanova told the Los Angeles Times his client cooperated with authorities upon realizing that Williamson had entangled her in an alleged scheme to funnel money from a fraudulent campaign account into one belonging to another one of her co-conspirators. Podesta is not accused of wrongdoing.\n\n\"Podesta has not been and should not be charged,\" Portanova told Playbook, while saying he could not share specific details.\n\nWilliamson mentored Podesta and her allies say she transferred her sizable book of business to her as Williamson joined the Newsom administration in early 2023. Sacramento consultant Steve Maviglio, who counts Williamson as a longtime friend, said Podesta's turn on her former mentor was \"the biggest shock to me, of all.\"\n\n\"Alexis is where she is because of Dana and Nancy McFadden,\" Maviglio said, referring to the late Brown administration chief of staff. \"They plucked her from a medium-level position and made her a Cabinet secretary because they thought she was amazing and had a lot of potential as a young woman. And it breaks my heart to see what's happened here.\"\n\nMaviglio said he spoke with Williamson on Wednesday evening, and she told him that her arrest was conducted by authorities \"with guns and shields\" who handcuffed her adult child. A person briefed on the arrest and granted anonymity to describe it said \"it's all standard procedure\" when asked about those circumstances, adding that \"the search warrant was timed so that no minor children were in the home.\"\n\nWilliamson's attorney did not respond to a request for comment from Playbook on Thursday. Williamson has pleaded not guilty to all charges, while longtime Sacramento lobbyist Greg Campbell, a co-conspirator and close friend who was also indicted, accepted a plea deal and has cooperated with authorities, according to his attorney.\n\nAnother friend of Williamson's, Office of Tax Appeals Chief Deputy Director Deborah Hoffman, attended the federal indictment hearing Wednesday in Sacramento and escorted Williamson out of the building. Today will be her last day in the office, a representative for the OTA told Playbook, \"as part of her expected retirement.\" (KCRA first reported her departure.) Her appointment had just been announced in January.\n\nOn Thursday, Podesta appeared to distance herself from Williamson. Clients of hers circulated a text message that they said was from Podesta stating \"I have always conducted myself -- and my business -- with integrity.\" She acknowledged taking over Williamson's portfolio in late 2022, including payments from former California Attorney General Xavier Becerra's dormant campaign account at the center of the indictment.\n\n\"At that time, I had no reason to question the legitimacy of the account or how it had originally been established by an outside law firm,\" the message read. \"The moment I was advised that the payments associated with this work were not appropriate, I immediately ceased all involvement.\"\n\nWilliamson's critics said the allegations against Newsom's former chief were unsurprising. Gil Duran, who worked in the Brown administration with Williamson, compared her to a \"mafia boss\" on CNN.\n\n\"Dana has a reputation for being reckless, for being irresponsible and for being a bully,\" Duran said. \"She was somebody who loved power and loved to abuse power.\"\n\nWilliamson's tough reputation fed into less-than-sympathetic reactions to her indictment.\n\n\"I can't think of a positive experience that I've ever had with Dana Williamson,\" said one Democratic consultant granted anonymity to speak candidly. \"She's just a very sharp-tongued, take-no-prisoner, kind of hater.\"\n\nOthers were befuddled. Garry South, a longtime Democratic campaign strategist who has crossed paths with Williamson while working for California governors, said he was confused as to how no one noticed the money allegedly stolen from Becerra's account. Accountants tasked with overseeing such transactions and filing financial disclosures are \"pretty keen-eyed in spotting suspicious transactions,\" he said.\n\n\"Did the Becerra account have no one watching it except the consultants who were pilfering from it? Those of us who have run campaigns are scratching our heads,\" South said.\n\n-- with help from Melanie Mason\n\nGOOD MORNING. Happy Friday.

In Brazil's Amazon region on the last leg of his climate journey.\n\nTHURMOND'S FOIL -- State superintendent Tony Thurmond, a gubernatorial candidate, swiped at Rick Caruso after Playbook reported on polling testing positive and negative messaging on the mall magnate.\n\nThurmond in a video posted to his social media read the poll's negative charges, including that Caruso changed his party affiliation several times, is a billionaire and was endorsed by Elon Musk.\n\nCaruso's camp hasn't taken credit for the survey and didn't comment to Playbook on it, but Thurmond inferred it was commissioned by the one-time Los Angeles mayoral candidate and possible gubernatorial candidate.\n\n\"Well, I wasn't going to say it,\" Thurmond said, smiling after reading the negative messages.\n\nGERRYMANDERING TALK -- Proposition 50 didn't just make Republican Rep. David Valadao's district more competitive for Democrats. The measure itself is factoring into their campaigns.\n\nAssemblymember Jasmeet Bains is fundraising off of the district becoming more Democratic after the gerrymander succeeded, according to draft text and email blasts viewed by Playbook. At least one solicitation has already gone out.\n\n\"Here's what the results of this election means for us and our campaign: CA-22 is OFFICIALLY a TOSS-UP race,\" read one fundraising plea issued after the Prop 50 election.\n\nBains voted against putting the measure on the ballot -- something the campaign for her more progressive opponent, Visalia school board member Randy Villegas, criticized her for even before Prop 50 passed.\n\n\"Unlike ALL Democratic state representatives who voted to support this effort, Villegas' opponent in the Democratic primary for CA-22, Assemblywoman Jasmeet Bains, was the only Democrat to vote against the proposal,\" read an August press statement from Villegas' campaign, which included quotes from local Democratic Party chairs arguing for the need for Prop 50. Villegas supported the measure, which passed resoundingly.\n\nA spokesperson for Bains, in a statement explaining the ad push, emphasized that \"California voters decided on Prop 50 making CA-22 a toss up.\"\n\nThat \"also means Dr. Bains is now the only candidate, Democrat or Republican, who actually lives in this district,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nThat was an implicit shot at both Valadao, who is from nearby Hanford, and Villegas, who also lives just outside the district in Visalia.\n\nVillegas' campaign defended his status as a \"son of the Central Valley,\" listing his elementary and middle school education in the Central Valley and his attendance at Bakersfield College.\n\n\"He's spent almost his whole life here and serves his community he grew up in every day, whether it's educating students in Tulare and Hanford or at his family's auto shop back home in Bakersfield,\" a spokesperson for Villegas' campaign said in a statement. \"He's fighting for his community because it's the one that raised him, and he's going to continue fighting for us in Congress.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Valadao didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nIN HER CORNER -- Former Sen. Barbara Boxer is weighing in on the crowded field for a congressional seat that has been made more competitive under Prop 50. At a news conference Thursday, the former senator endorsed Marni von Wilpert, a member of the San Diego City Council, for the race to unseat GOP Rep. Darrell Issa.\n\nBoxer praised von Wilpert as \"lifelong public servant and former prosecutor who flipped San Diego's most conservative city council seat blue.\"\n\nThe endorsement is notable for its location, at the LGBTQ Community Center of the Desert in Palm Springs -- a community that has been newly added to the 48th Congressional District as part of redistricting. Von Wilpert, along with the other candidates from San Diego County, will need to cultivate new voters in the Palm Springs area in what is expected to be one of the most competitive races in the midterms. -- Ben Fox\n\nINTO THE WOODS -- Newsom is capping off his Brazilian jaunt with a swing through the Amazon rainforest, where he's talking to Indigenous communities about how to preserve the region's carbon stocks. It's long been a sensitive question in California, where regulators have been talking to Brazilian officials for years but haven't pulled the trigger on allowing businesses to buy carbon reductions from the region to offset their in-state emissions. Read last night's California Climate for the back story on California's complicated history with the world's largest carbon sink.\n\nGOP REINFORCEMENTS -- The Trump administration is attempting to block California's new congressional map that was approved by voters last week, which would create five additional House districts favoring Democrats, Aaron Pellish reports. The Justice Department on Thursday sought to intervene in a lawsuit originally filed by the California Republican Party, which looks to prohibit the state from implementing new maps.\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi accused Newsom of executing a \"brazen power grab\" and argued the maps violate civil rights laws. But Newsom's camp and Democratic lawmakers said they're confident the voter-approved effort will hold up in court: \"Californians spoke clearly -- this baseless political stunt won't change that,\" said state Sen.

    "title": "Letters to the Editor: As the federal government turns away, California must lead on climate issues",
    "body": "To the editor: Kudos to Gov. Gavin Newsom for stepping up to fill the void that the Trump administration has left as the president abdicates our country's global leadership on climate change and instead attacks environmental science and kowtows to the fossil fuel industry (\"At Brazilian climate summit, Newsom positions California as a stand-in for the U.S.,\" Nov. 12).\n\nOur governor's presence at the COP30 meeting in Brazil is evidence of the fact that most Americans still have grave concerns about our warming planet and believe that a coordinated global strategy is needed. Now more than ever, with the federal government absent on the issue, our state of California must lead at the national and international level to advance sensible climate policies that are focused on the rapid development and adoption of affordable clean energy solutions.\n\nTo the editor: Newsom demonstrates more commitment to climate change than President Trump, but that's a low bar. Every electric vehicle buyer is managing that.\n\nA large delegation at the United Nations conference doesn't guarantee reduced emissions. Preventing an electric utility from behaving like a private corporation as it tries to impede solar panel installations does. Not buckling under threats from oil refineries and holding the line on new oil drilling does.\n\nYears of inspiring but vague language has left us facing hellish heating. Rachel Cleetus of the Union of Concerned Scientists asserts that \"world leaders still have the power to sharply cut these emissions\" (\"California steps in as Trump skips global climate summit in Brazil,\" Nov. 7). But their will to do so is debatable. Global leadership that remains comfortable in the pockets of the Michael Milkens of the world will prioritize \"abundance\" and \"economic opportunity.\" This profit-seeking is what put us where we are now. People over profit is not a slogan -- it's survival.",

    "title": "Column: Two politicians who impressed in 2025? Gavin Newsom and Marjorie Taylor Greene",
    "body": "This is read by an automated voice. Please report any issues or inconsistencies here.\n\nShe's a little bit country; he's a little bit rock 'n' roll.\n\nAnd me? I'm a little bit stunned. Two politicians have emerged, against all odds, to surprise and impress us this year: Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-Calif.) and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.).\n\nYou'd be hard-pressed to find two Americans less similar -- politically, culturally, geographically, maybe even molecularly. These two occupy opposite poles. She's NASCAR and CrossFit. He's electric vehicles and Pinot Noir. They shouldn't have much in common, but lately, both have done the unthinkable: They've taken on President Trump and lived (politically) to tell about it.\n\nLet's start with Greene because, honestly, she's more fun.\n\nFor years, MTG was seen as an embarrassment. The QAnon congresswoman. The \"Jewish space laser\" lady. The lawmaker who, just two years prior to winning her House seat, questioned whether a plane really hit the Pentagon on 9/11.\n\nShe harassed a then-teenage Parkland survivor and coined the immortal phrase \"gazpacho police,\" apparently confusing the soup with Nazi secret police.\n\nBut then, something strange happened: Greene started making sense. Not \"agree with her at dinner\" sense, but the \"wait, that's not totally insane\" kind.\n\nShe blasted Trump's decision to bomb Iran, which -- if you take the \"America First\" philosophy literally and not just as performance art -- is consistent with her beliefs. And in a time when selling out is perceived as being shrewder than standing for something, the mere act of holding a consistent position is a virtue.\n\nMTG also called out her own party for blocking the Epstein files, and volunteered to walk \"on the House floor and say every damn name that abused these women.\"\n\nAnd in an act of shocking populist coherence, she ripped into Republicans for letting Obamacare subsidies expire: \"Health insurance premiums will DOUBLE,\" she thundered on X, adding: \"Not a single Republican in leadership talked to us about this or has given us a plan to help Americans deal with their health insurance premiums DOUBLING!!!\"\n\nTrump, naturally, took all this personally. \"I don't know what happened to Marjorie,\" he said, recently. \"Nice woman, but she's lost her way.\" To which Greene, never one to back down, fired back: \"I haven't lost my way. I'm 100% America First and only!\"\n\nThe thing I'm liking about Greene isn't just that she's standing up to Trump -- although, I admit, it's fun to watch. But what's really refreshing is that she's a true believer who got elected, got famous and yet continues to believe.\n\nWhich brings us to Gavin Newsom.\n\nNewsom has always been the poster boy for everything people hate about California -- a man who looks like he was genetically engineered by a Napa Valley venture capitalist to play a slick politician.\n\nThe \"important\" coiffed hair. The smug grin. The French Laundry dinner during COVID-19, while the rest of us were holed up in our houses microwaving Lean Cuisines.\n\nOnce upon a time, he and his then-wife, Kimberly Guilfoyle, posed on a rug for a Harper's Bazaar spread where they were dubbed \"The New Kennedys.\"\n\nEnough said.\n\nIf Greene is the quintessential MAGA mama, Newsom is the slick bro you want to throat punch. But somehow he has had a banner year.\n\nNewsom stood firm against ICE raids and troop deployments in Los Angeles. Then, he trolled Trump with online memes that actually landed.\n\nAfter Texas Republicans tried to grab five congressional seats for the GOP, Newsom shepherded Prop. 50 through California -- an amendment to the state constitution aimed at mitigating Texas' gerrymandering by redrawing maps to help Democrats even the score.\n\nThen, he waltzed into Houston for a celebratory rally -- some political end zone dancing on the opponents' home turf, just to twist the knife.\n\nLike Greene, the guy has moxie.\n\nAnd here's the thing I'm learning from the Trump era: Guts come from the most unlikely places, and looks can be deceiving.\n\nYou never know when some heroic-looking leader will fold like a cheap suit, just like you never know when some \"heel\" out of central casting for villains will turn \"face\" and rise to the occasion.\n\nI don't mean to sound naive. I'm not proposing a Newsom-Greene 2028 unity ticket. (Although ... tell me you wouldn't watch that convention.)\n\nThe odds are, both of these figures will disappoint me again, probably by next Thursday. Life is complicated, and it's sometimes hard to disentangle heroism from opportunism.\n\nIndeed, some have speculated that MTG's sudden streak of independence is the result of Trump putting the kibosh on a \"Greene for U.S. Senate\" bid in Georgia. And as for Newsom -- is his show of toughness an act of patriotism, or a prelude to his own presidential campaign?\n\nFrankly, that's a difference without a distinction.\n\nFor now, here's what is clear: These two political figures have shown a flash -- a glimmer -- of something like backbone.\n\nAnd in the year of our Lord 2025, that's rarer, and more valuable, than almost any commodity in politics.",

    "body": "The president's brazen hypocrisy was exposed by California Gov. Gavin Newsom and many others.\n\nDonald Trump's remarks on the importance of caring for the most vulnerable children drew major eyerolls and accusations of deep hypocrisy on Thursday.\n\nThe president, speaking at a White House event launching first lady Melania Trump's \"Fostering the Future\" initiative, which seeks to expand opportunities for youngsters in foster care, said:\n\n\"The Bible tells us that one of the measures of any society is how it cares for vulnerable children and orphans. So important, and it is so big in the Bible. So, as we make America great again, we're going to protect American children in foster care and ensure that they will never, ever be forgotten.\"\n\nWatch from the 15:45 point here:\n\nSome people on social media suggested Trump was misquoting the Bible with his political spin on the longstanding idea of helping those most in need.\n\nMany, though, highlighted how the president's rhetoric was in stark contrast to his record, particularly his administration's attempt to block Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program payments to low-income families during the recently ended government shutdown.\n\n\"You literally fought in court to strip families of food assistance,\" California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) pointed out on X, formerly Twitter.",

    "body": "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- California Gov. Gavin Newsom's former chief of staff was arrested and indicted on federal corruption charges this week, roughly a year after she disclosed the investigation to Newsom's office and was placed on leave.\n\nDana Williamson is accused of helping in a scheme to steal campaign money from former federal Health Secretary Xavier Becerra, filling fraudulent tax forms for personal expenses and making false statements to law enforcement.\n\nNeither Becerra nor Newsom are accused of any wrongdoing in the indictment. Becerra, now a candidate for California governor, called the news \"a gut punch.\"\n\nNewsom's office noted Wednesday that Williamson no longer worked in the office and later revealed Williamson had been placed on leave in November 2024 after telling the office she was under criminal investigation. Her leave was not publicly disclosed at the time. Newsom's office formally announced her departure and his hiring of a new chief of staff that December.\n\nHere's what to know:\n\nA longtime Democratic power broker in the Capitol circle, Williamson worked as an adviser to former Gov. Gray Davis and as a Cabinet secretary for former Gov. Jerry Brown before opening her own political affairs firm. She served as Becerra's campaign manager when he ran for state attorney general in 2018.\n\nShe was named Newsom's chief of staff in late 2022, a job she held for roughly two years.\n\nWilliamson is known for her savvy and aggressive style, often unafraid to spar publicly and privately with those who disagree with her.\n\nFederal authorities said the investigation into Williamson began under the Biden administration more than three years ago.\n\nThe indictment, first reported by the Sacramento Bee, includes 23 charges of conspiracy to commit bank and wire fraud, bank fraud, wire fraud, conspiracy to defraud the United States and obstruct justice, subscribing to false tax returns, and making false statements.\n\nShe entered a not guilty plea in federal court Wednesday.\n\nWilliamson is accused of developing a plan to help Sean McCluskie, a longtime Becerra aide, siphon $225,000 from one of Becerra's dormant state campaign accounts to pad his salary after he accepted a job as his chief of staff in Washington.\n\nShe then allegedly arranged for another person, an unnamed former public official, to take over the operation before joining Newsom's office.\n\nWilliamson is said to falsify business contracts related to Paycheck Protection Program loans that her business received during the COVID-19 pandemic. She also allegedly filed fraudulent tax forms from 2021 to 2023 to claim more than $1 million in business deductions for personal expenses, such as luxury handbags and jewelry; private jet travel; vacations in Mexico; installation of a home HVAC system; and several hundred thousand dollars paid to various relatives for fake jobs.\n\nShe could face up to 20 years in prison if convicted.\n\nThe federal indictment lists four other co-conspirators.\n\nMcCluskie, Becerra's ex-aide, signed a plea agreement Oct. 30 in which he admitted to one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud and wire fraud. Lobbyist Greg Campbell also signed a plea deal admitting to one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud and wire fraud and one count of conspiracy to defraud the United States.\n\nProsecutors didn't name the last co-conspirator, who took over handling the payments from Williamson when she joined Newsom's office.\n\nThe scheme began after McCluskie agreed to take the job as Becerra's chief of staff in 2022, a role that resulted in a pay cut of roughly $180,000, according to his plea agreement.\n\nWilliamson used her political consulting company to bill Becerra's campaign account for purported services. The money would then be sent to Campbell's company as a conduit before reaching McCluskie's wife.\n\nNewsom is not mentioned in the indictment, and it does not allege any wrongdoing by Williamson related to her state government job.\n\nBut Williamson's attorney, McGregor Scott, told Los Angeles Times that federal authorities under the Biden administration asked her to cooperate in a probe into the governor more than a year ago. He didn't provide any details.\n\n\"She told them she had no information to provide them, and then we wind up today with these charges,\" Scott said in a statement to The Times. He did not respond to requests for comment from The Associated Press.\n\nNewsom's office said the governor was unaware of any investigation involving him, a spokesperson said in a statement Thursday.\n\nScott was the U.S. attorney in Sacramento during President Donald Trump's first term and under former President George W. Bush. He criticized how the federal government handled Williamson's arrest, saying she was not given an option to surrender and that federal authorities are aware that Williamson is undergoing serious health challenges.\n\nThough the arrest sent shock waves in Sacramento, few lawmakers, lobbyists or other Capitol insiders have publicly commented on it. Republican Assemblyman David Tangipa said the indictment revealed wider problems. \"This is not just one bad actor,\" he said in a campaign email. \"It's a symptom of a broken culture of power and privilege in Sacramento.\"\n\nWilliamson was released Wednesday on a $500,000 bond under travel restrictions. Her house will be used as collateral.\n\nAs part of her conditions for release, Williamson will have to surrender her passport and is prohibited from consuming alcohol or drugs. She also cannot contact any of the co-conspirators.",

    "title": "US senators take public testimony on wildfire response at Palisades field hearing",
    "body": "Sens. Rick Scott of Florida and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin held a hearing 'to uncover what went wrong.' No Democratic lawmaker participated, which Gov. Gavin Newsom's office panned as an attempt to score 'cheap points.''\n\nSeveral Pacific Palisades residents provided testimony on Thursday, Nov. 13, during a congressional hearing about the January wildfire that devastated their community, sharing perspectives about the response from state and local governments and what should be done moving forward to help with recovery efforts.\n\nThe hearing was led by two Republican U.S. senators - Sens. Rick Scott of Florida and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin. No Democratic lawmaker participated in the hearing.\n\nScott, who chairs the U.S. Senate Special Committee on Aging, and Johnson, chair of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee's Subcommittee on Investigations, had announced in September that they would launch an investigation into the Palisades fire.\n\nThursday's hearing, at the American Legion building in Pacific Palisades, was billed as an opportunity to \"uncover what went wrong from the community's perspective, identify opportunities for reform, and ensure that no community is left behind in future disaster preparation or recovery efforts,\" according to a media advisory ahead of the event - although Gov. Gavin Newsom's office derided it as an attempt by the two senators to score \"cheap points\" and promote themselves.\n\nDuring the hearing, Scott called the fire \"an unacceptable failure of government to protect the lives and property of its citizens.\"\n\n\"Over the years, billions upon billions of federal tax dollars -- taxpayer dollars -- have been directed to California to support fire management and disaster mitigation efforts. Yet, on the day of the Pacific Palisades fire, reservoirs were empty, fire hydrants went dry and innocent people, including many vulnerable seniors, perished while thousands more lost their homes, businesses and everything they owned,\" Scott said.\n\nReality TV star Spencer Pratt, who is suing the city of Los Angeles after he and his wife lost their Pacific Palisades home in the fire, spoke before a panel of witnesses shared their own experiences.\n\nPratt criticized the slow pace of recovery and called the rebuilding process \"an absolute nightmare,\" from delays in obtaining building permits to questions about soil toxicity. Referencing the community of Paradise, which is still rebuilding seven years after the Camp fire, he said \"it's hard to see that and believe our town will ever be rebuilt in our lifetime.\"\n\n\"It's hard not to feel abandoned by our state and local politicians, and it's hard to not lose hope,\" he added.\n\nNewsom's office, in an emailed statement after the hearing, said: \"Our hearts go out to the victims of the Palisades fire, as well as the victims of the nearby Altadena fire. Unfortunately, Senators Scott and Johnson chose to use this forum to spew misinformation and promote themselves, which provides no benefit to the Palisades community, or to the Altadena communities the senators seem to have completely forgotten about.\"\n\nNo representative from Altadena, where the Eaton fire also destroyed thousands of homes, was part of Thursday's line-up of speakers. It was not immediately clear whether Scott or Johnson, or their staff, had invited anyone from the San Gabriel Valley to participate in the hearing.\n\nNewsom's office said that the state has repeatedly requested additional FEMA funding from the federal government but claimed the funding \"is being blocked by the Trump administration and MAGA Republicans\" (a reference to Trump allies).\n\n\"The governor's request for additional funding is sitting on (House) Speaker (Mike) Johnson's desk ready to be acted on - now that the government is reopened, perhaps this could be a Republican priority,\" Newsom's office stated.\n\nThe governor's office also dismissed as false any claims that prescribed burns aren't occurring and said that President Donald Trump made cuts to the U.S. Forest Service that provides critical wildfire prevention efforts earlier this year.\n\nDuring Thursday's hearing, Johnson said the purpose of gathering testimony was to highlight residents' stories, identify ways to prevent future disasters and to help the Palisades community rebuild - but to do so responsibly. The question, he said, is whether American taxpayers should spend billions of dollars to help in this recovery effort.\n\n\"I certainly don't trust the elected officials in California, Los Angeles, to use that money wisely. So we're going to have to have controls over that,\" said the senator from Wisconsin. He added that Congress should insist that California leaders implement strategies such as control burns to prevent future widespread fires.\n\nDavid Schwarz, who chairs the Pacific Palisades Community Council Rebuilding Committee but was speaking only for himself during the hearing, agreed that the federal government should insist on certain conditions before sending money to Los Angeles.\n\nHe said Congress should insist that Newsom create an independent Palisades Reconstruction Authority, much like the governor of New York did after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, to oversee rebuilding efforts, and to grant that authority certain powers to expedite rebuilding, such as cutting through bureaucratic permitting requirements or perhaps waiving wage regulations for contractors.\n\nSchwarz also spoke of the need to invest in \"fire resilience improvements,\" such as locating utilities underground, as part of the rebuilding effort.\n\nOther Palisades residents who testified said they received evacuation notices too late on Jan. 7, the day the fires broke out, and criticized local governments for their disaster preparedness and response - or lack thereof.\n\nCiting empty water reservoirs to fight the fires and non-working fire hydrants, among other issues, some residents also blamed the Palisades fire on the city of L.A.'s \"diversity, equity and inclusion\" hiring practices, suggesting that \"unqualified\" people were hired to oversee city infrastructure.\n\nLongtime resident Bruce Schwartz, who said he was once named the community's honorary fire chief, pointed to the Jan. 1 Lachman fire in the Palisades, which was thought to have been extinguished but wasn't. Instead, the flames reignited six days later, leading to the catastrophic Palisades fire.\n\nJonathan Rinderknecht, 29, a former resident of the Palisades, has been charged in connection with the Lachman fire, which investigators believe was intentionally set.\n\nThe reignition of that fire on Jan. 7 resulted in the most destructive wildfire in the city's history. The Palisades fire raged on for 25 days, destroying more than 23,000 acres, killing 12 and burning about 6,800 structures in Pacific Palisades and in Malibu, according to prosecutors with the U.S. Department of Justice.\n\nSchwartz blamed the person responsible for the firefighting crew that responded to the Lachman fire for not making sure that the initial fire was fully extinguished.\n\n\"When you have unqualified people appointed to positions of authority that don't have the experience or (is) unqualified, this is what can happen,\" Schwartz said.\n\nLos Angeles City Councilmember Hugo Soto-Martinez previously blasted a suggestion that the DEI hiring practices may be to blame for the fires when Scott and Johnson requested information from the city.\n\n\"DEI did not cause the fires, and these senators should take their witch hunts elsewhere,\" Soto-Martinez said.\n\nThe Los Angeles Fire Department, whose spokesperson was away at a work conference, did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday afternoon.\n\nL.A. Mayor Karen Bass' office, when asked, also did not respond specifically to the comments regarding the city's DEI hiring practices.\n\nHowever, her office said in a statement that neither of the two U.S. senators who led Thursday's hearing reached out to the mayor to discuss how they might work together.\n\n\"Mayor Bass worked in Congress for more than a decade with colleagues on both sides of the aisle,\" her office said. \"She will work with anyone, no matter their party, to support the Palisades community, and she remains laser-focused on expediting the rebuilding of homes, businesses and community spaces to get families home - not on political theater.\"\n\nAs Thursday's hearing was taking place, the mayor's office also announced that the first set of applications to expedite the rebuilding of single-family homes in the Palisades, under a new pilot program, had been approved.",

    "title": "The trailing vines between Sacramento and the Amazon",
    "body": "With help from Noah Baustin, Alex Nieves and Amelia Davidson\n\nINTO THE WOODS: Gov. Gavin Newsom spent Thursday deep in the Amazon, meeting Indigenous leaders in the community of Jamaraquá and learning about their \"nature-based carbon-capture work\" in the vast rainforest known as the \"lungs of the planet.\" The encounter is reviving an old and complicated conversation -- how exactly California might support the Amazon rainforest, where ranching, logging, farming and road-building are causing rapid deforestation.\n\nBrazilian officials have long cultivated California as a potential revenue source to entice landowners to keep trees standing. The state's cap-and-trade market allows businesses to pay for emissions reductions elsewhere in lieu of some of their required in-state cuts, and the world's largest carbon sink is an obvious target. But the offset projects have long raised concerns among environmental justice advocates in California, who would prefer to reduce emissions at home and point to reports showing they don't reduce as much carbon as they claim and sometimes go up in smoke -- literally -- in wildfires.\n\nEduardo Taveira, the environment minister for the state of Amazonas, the largest Brazilian state that includes vast stretches of forest, told POLITICO he saw Newsom's up-close encounter with the Amazon -- and Brazil's hosting of the U.N. climate talks more broadly -- as a \"huge opportunity\" to show the on-the-ground reality lived by Amazonian communities -- and turn global attention into cash.\n\n\"We need more investment than conversations,\" said Taveira.\n\nTaveira, who's traveled to Sacramento before, said he hopes that California's delegation will be inspired to craft a new kind of international standard for forest offsets -- one that recognizes and rewards communities for protecting forests instead of seeking primarily to reduce the carbon footprint of companies based in the United States.\n\n\"The discussion is not just about price or integrity,\" Taveira said. \"You need to change this vision and try to tackle the problems at the scale of the communities, including their perspective.\"\n\nTaveira and the governor of Amazonas pitched the idea to state Sen. Henry Stern this week in Belém, the Amazon port city hosting COP30. Stern said he was open to the pitch and \"might\" bring it to the Legislature. \"It's great we can share knowledge and share data and monitoring tools, but we also have a $60 billion carbon market,\" Stern said. \"Can we really be a subnational acting like a nation-state if there's no money on the table?\"\n\nNewsom's been getting the pitch, too. He said Wednesday he had \"a number of conversations\" on the topic in Brazil -- including with Indigenous leaders in Belém and at an investors conference in São Paulo -- but struck a cautious tone. He acknowledged that California lawmakers remain divided and that the idea has long drawn opposition from within the state's environmental community.\n\n\"It's a nuanced issue,\" he told POLITICO. \"I'm always open to argument, but I'm interested in evidence. I'm not ideological about these things. ... It's an interesting space, I'll leave it at that. I'm not asserting anything, and we sure as heck aren't committed.\"\n\nThe Brazilian hosts' signature request of the wealthy countries visiting for COP30 this year is a multibillion-dollar international fund to combat deforestation, with a dedicated portion for Indigenous communities (California can't contribute -- only nations). Another example already underway: Acre, a western Brazilian state, recently struck a deal with offset buyers to direct 70 percent of the proceeds to Indigenous groups and forest stewards.\n\nBrazil's push comes as California's Air Resources Board begins redoing its own rules for its carbon market, which lawmakers and Newsom just extended through 2045 -- and as memories linger from a previous attempt to bridge the two worlds. In 2019, CARB adopted a tropical forest protocol for offsets after a heated public hearing that exposed deep divisions over the role of forestry offsets. But it never took the next step to incorporate it into the state's carbon market, which would have let companies count projects in tropical forests towards their emissions goals.\n\nCalifornia environment groups remain skeptical. Nyshie Perkinson of the Center for Biological Diversity said on the sidelines of COP in Belém that the group broadly opposes forest offsets but didn't have enough information about the new proposals to comment specifically.\n\nStill, Newsom's presence in the rainforest underscored how closely the state's climate politics remain tied to global efforts to keep tropical forests standing. Before heading in, Newsom called his upcoming travels a spiritual experience.\n\n\"It's so iconic, so evocative, so it informs so much of what inspires us as children to care about the Earth and Mother Nature,\" Newsom said. \"It connects us to our creator.\" -- CvK\n\nWISH WE WERE THERE: Newsom's Democratic congressional allies would be in Brazil alongside him, if it wasn't for the pesky Republicans. At least that's how a group of senior Democrats framed their absence from COP30, Amelia Davidson reports for POLITICO's E&E News.\n\nA group of eight House Democrats, led by former Speaker Nancy Pelosi, said that Speaker Mike Johnson's refusal to bring the House into session until Wednesday had kept them from attending the climate conference.\n\n\"The world still needs and wants American leadership, and unfortunately, the consequence of Donald Trump pulling the United States delegation out at the federal level is just that China is going to get a few more of these amazing opportunities,\" said Rep. Jared Huffman (D-Calif.), who'd also planned to go.\n\nSen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) is still planning on showing up starting Friday, though, and plans to tout a carbon border adjustment mechanism as \"the last and best remaining prospect for a pathway to climate safety.\" -- AD, NB\n\nSHOW US THE MONEY: California air regulators are mapping a path forward for zero-emission car and heavy-duty truck incentives that could offer the key to combating a regulatory vacuum after the Trump administration nixed the state's EV sales mandate -- but limited funding is complicating the equation.\n\nThe California Air Resources Board hosted a workshop Thursday to gather input from industry and environmental groups on their priorities for spending limited dollars on incentive programs. The responses were decidedly mixed.\n\nCar manufacturers, including Hyundai and Rivian, pushed officials to backfill a portion of the $7,500 federal tax credit for EV buyers that congressional Republicans ended last month, arguing that knocking off even a few thousand dollars from the purchase price will attract more buyers. Newsom has already conceded that California can't afford to fully replace the federal incentive, and enviros countered that purchasing help should be reserved for low-income drivers.\n\nOther ideas shared included more funding for e-bikes, which the state has deprioritized in favor of EVs, support for shared options like ZEV carsharing and vanpools and even incentives for high-ethanol vehicles (a concept CARB staff quickly shot down).\n\nThe one thing that everyone agreed on is that current incentive plans fall well short of the demand in both the light-duty and heavy-duty sectors.\n\n\"To the question of if there's enough money, there isn't,\" said Tom Fulks, a consultant for WattEV, which develops truck charging depots. \"There never is.\" -- AN\n\nI GET KNOCKED DOWN: The anchor of Northern California's nascent offshore wind industry has had a rough few months. But it's not out for the count.\n\n\"The federal government had invested in the Port of Humboldt. That has been reversed,\" Rob Holmlund, Humboldt Bay Harbor District development director, said Thursday during a California Energy Commission panel. \"But I anticipate that the federal government will be investing in clean forms of reliable energy in the future, and then obviously the private sector is going to invest in all this.\"\n\nState leaders hope the harbor will one day be the home base for turbines spinning more than 20 miles offshore west of Eureka. Before that can happen, the Humboldt Bay Harbor District needs to complete a major port build-out to be able to service the massive components needed to assemble and maintain an offshore wind farm.\n\nIn August, the Trump administration pulled the plug on $434 million in grants the U.S. Department of Transportation had committed to the project. Holmlund and his team are continuing the planning process nonetheless.\n\nThey're expecting to receive a cut of the $475 million set aside for offshore wind infrastructure at California ports in last year's $10 billion state climate bond and plan to bring in private investment, according to Holmlund. They anticipate finishing their California Environmental Quality Act process and permitting in the next two years, setting the stage for a three-year construction phase. -- NB\n\nOUR OWN DAMN SATELLITE: Data is starting to roll in from California's methane leak-detecting satellite, which the state launched in March after nearly a decade of planning.\n\nNewsom's office said Thursday that the Tanager-1 satellite has spotted 10 large methane leaks at oil and gas facilities around the state, helping CARB enforce rules that require oil and gas field operators to inspect their systems quarterly and repair leaks.\n\nA new dashboard shows that six of the leaks were clustered in the Bay Area and the Central Valley, while the other four were located near Los Angeles, San Diego, Sacramento and the Inland Empire. -- AN\n\nAAA: California's battery systems now provide enough capacity to meet about one quarter of the state's record peak demand for several hours, the governor's office announced Thursday.\n\nCalifornia has now reached nearly 17,000 megawatts of battery storage, with 1,200 MW coming in the past six months, according to the governor's office.\n\nNewsom's amplification of the milestone underscored how central batteries, and their ability to stretch energy generated by solar into the dark evening hours, have become to his administration's push to meet the state's clean energy goals. In 2019, California had 771 MW of battery storage.\n\n\"We're deploying more battery storage than any state in America, building a stronger grid, cutting pollution, and making abundant clean energy even more affordable,\" Newsom said in a statement. -- NB\n\nCAISO CHANGE: Anja Gilbert is moving to a new gig at the California Independent System Operator, which oversees the state's electrical grid. Gilbert is now the organization's policy manager of demand flexibility, where she'll lead CAISO's work focused on how to factor in resources like solar panels and home batteries that generate and store energy and demand response programs -- which incentivize residents to reduce their electricity use -- into wholesale energy markets.\n\nShe was previously CAISO's lead policy developer for greenhouse gas accounting and resource adequacy. -- AN\n\n-- The insurance industry launched a new institute to study increasingly severe thunderstorms, which are causing a growing share of insurance claims.\n\n-- The green group 350.org is suspending U.S. operations after income dropped by more than a quarter.\n\n-- The America Is All In coalition (co-chaired by Newsom) is looking for an executive director (salary range $203,000 to $242,000).\n\nCALIFORNIA POLICY IS ALWAYS CHANGING: Know your next move.

    "body": "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- California Gov. Gavin Newsom's former chief of staff was arrested and indicted on federal corruption charges this week, roughly a year after she disclosed the investigation to Newsom's office and was placed on leave.\n\nDana Williamson is accused of helping in a scheme to steal campaign money from former federal Health Secretary Xavier Becerra, filling fraudulent tax forms for personal expenses and making false statements to law enforcement.\n\nNeither Becerra nor Newsom are accused of any wrongdoing in the indictment. Becerra, now a candidate for California governor, called the news \"a gut punch.\"\n\nNewsom's office noted Wednesday that Williamson no longer worked in the office and later revealed Williamson had been placed on leave in November 2024 after telling the office she was under criminal investigation. Her leave was not publicly disclosed at the time. Newsom's office formally announced her departure and his hiring of a new chief of staff that December.\n\nHere's what to know:\n\nA longtime Democratic power broker in the Capitol circle, Williamson worked as an adviser to former Gov. Gray Davis and as a Cabinet secretary for former Gov. Jerry Brown before opening her own political affairs firm. She served as Becerra's campaign manager when he ran for state attorney general in 2018.\n\nShe was named Newsom's chief of staff in late 2022, a job she held for roughly two years.\n\nWilliamson is known for her savvy and aggressive style, often unafraid to spar publicly and privately with those who disagree with her.\n\nFederal authorities said the investigation into Williamson began under the Biden administration more than three years ago.\n\nThe indictment, first reported by the Sacramento Bee, includes 23 charges of conspiracy to commit bank and wire fraud, bank fraud, wire fraud, conspiracy to defraud the United States and obstruct justice, subscribing to false tax returns, and making false statements.\n\nShe entered a not guilty plea in federal court Wednesday.\n\nWilliamson is accused of developing a plan to help Sean McCluskie, a longtime Becerra aide, siphon $225,000 from one of Becerra's dormant state campaign accounts to pad his salary after he accepted a job as his chief of staff in Washington.\n\nShe then allegedly arranged for another person, an unnamed former public official, to take over the operation before joining Newsom's office.\n\nWilliamson is said to falsify business contracts related to Paycheck Protection Program loans that her business received during the COVID-19 pandemic. She also allegedly filed fraudulent tax forms from 2021 to 2023 to claim more than $1 million in business deductions for personal expenses, such as luxury handbags and jewelry; private jet travel; vacations in Mexico; installation of a home HVAC system; and several hundred thousand dollars paid to various relatives for fake jobs.\n\nShe could face up to 20 years in prison if convicted.\n\nThe federal indictment lists four other co-conspirators.\n\nMcCluskie, Becerra's ex-aide, signed a plea agreement Oct. 30 in which he admitted to one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud and wire fraud. Lobbyist Greg Campbell also signed a plea deal admitting to one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud and wire fraud and one count of conspiracy to defraud the United States.\n\nProsecutors didn't name the last co-conspirator, who took over handling the payments from Williamson when she joined Newsom's office.\n\nThe scheme began after McCluskie agreed to take the job as Becerra's chief of staff in 2022, a role that resulted in a pay cut of roughly $180,000, according to his plea agreement.\n\nWilliamson used her political consulting company to bill Becerra's campaign account for purported services. The money would then be sent to Campbell's company as a conduit before reaching McCluskie's wife.\n\nNewsom is not mentioned in the indictment, and it does not allege any wrongdoing by Williamson related to her state government job.\n\nBut Williamson's attorney, McGregor Scott, told Los Angeles Times that federal authorities under the Biden administration asked her to cooperate in a probe into the governor more than a year ago. He didn't provide any details.\n\n\"She told them she had no information to provide them, and then we wind up today with these charges,\" Scott said in a statement to The Times. He did not respond to requests for comment from The Associated Press.\n\nNewsom's office said the governor was unaware of any investigation involving him, a spokesperson said in a statement Thursday.\n\nScott was the U.S. attorney in Sacramento during President Donald Trump's first term and under former President George W. Bush. He criticized how the federal government handled Williamson's arrest, saying she was not given an option to surrender and that federal authorities are aware that Williamson is undergoing serious health challenges.\n\nThough the arrest sent shock waves in Sacramento, few lawmakers, lobbyists or other Capitol insiders have publicly commented on it. Republican Assemblyman David Tangipa said the indictment revealed wider problems. \"This is not just one bad actor,\" he said in a campaign email. \"It's a symptom of a broken culture of power and privilege in Sacramento.\"\n\nWilliamson was released Wednesday on a $500,000 bond under travel restrictions. Her house will be used as collateral.\n\nAs part of her conditions for release, Williamson will have to surrender her passport and is prohibited from consuming alcohol or drugs. She also cannot contact any of the co-conspirators.",

    "title": "Eaton fire victims ask Gov. Newsom for help persuading SCE to provide housing relief",
    "body": "A group representing thousands of Eaton fire victims is asking Gov. Gavin Newsom to block state approval needed for Southern California Edison to collect higher profits until the utility agrees to immediately pay $200,000 to each household displaced by the monstrous blaze.\n\nThe 8,500-member Eaton Fire Survivors Network said victims are teetering on homelessness and that SCE could recoup the money from a $21 billion state fund for three privately owned utilities that ignite wildfires.\n\nIn a Nov. 12 letter, Joy Chen, executive director of the survivors network, asked the governor to urge the state Public Utilities Commission to delay raising SCE's guaranteed profit margin from 10.33% to 11.75% until the utility takes care of displaced fire victims.\n\nChen added that the housing relief should come with no strings attached, meaning desperate survivors should not have to forfeit their right to sue to receive the money.\n\n\"More than 80% of us remain displaced, living in temporary rentals, trailers or cars. Most will lose housing (insurance) coverage within months. Credit cards are maxed out, savings are gone, and GoFundMe campaigns have been spent,\" she wrote. \"Parents are skipping meals to pay rent. Seniors are sleeping in cars near the neighborhoods that once were their homes.\"\n\nChen wrote that SCE could use its credit resources to front the money and then seek reimbursement from the $21 billion state Wildfire Fund, created in 2019 to keep privately owned utilities from going bankrupt if found liable for a wildfire. SCE, if found to be the cause of the Eaton fire, likely would go to the fund for any damages above $1 billion, creating concerns that the blaze would deplete the entire account. State legislators are considering ways to bolster the fund.\n\nMeanwhile, Chen noted that SCE is financially healthy. She noted that parent company Edison International had a third-quarter net income of $832 million compared to a net income of $516 million in the same quarter last year. Edison CEO Pedro Pizarro, in a recent earnings call, reported the company has made \"significant progress derisking\" the utility's financial outlook.\n\nEdison's fiscal performance was bolstered by the PUC's approval of SCE's request for rate increases, which Pizarro said are essential for the company's investments in the power grid and its safety.\n\n\"It would be unreasonable to grant any further profit increase while the families displaced by Edison's fire remain without stable housing,\" Chen wrote to Newsom. She contended there is precedent for the survivors network request because Pacific Gas and Electric provided emergency relief to survivors of the 2015 Butte Fire while litigation was pending.\n\nThe official cause of the Eaton fire, which damaged or destroyed more than 9,000 structures and killed 19 people in January, is still under state investigation. But Pizarro has acknowledged there is evidence the blaze was caused by a power line dormant for more than 50 years that became reenergized during the fierce windstorm.\n\nMore than 100 lawsuits have been filed blaming SCE for the fire. As an alternative to litigation, SCE has launched its own compensation program for victims who agree not to sue.\n\nEdison has declined the request to immediately pay housing relief, in favor of concentrating on its own compensation program. The utility also urged the PUC to grant its profit request.\n\n\"Southern California Edison's cost-of-capital request supports the financing necessary for a reliable and resilient grid. We remain committed to the community we have served for nearly 140 years,\" spokesperson David Eisenhauer said.\n\nUnder the \"fast pay\" component of SCE's compensation plan, owner/occupants of a destroyed 1,500-square-foot house would receive $900,000 in rebuilding money, plus $200,000 for going through the program. Another $115,000 per adult would be paid for noneconomic damages, while children would receive $75,000.\n\nEach death would bring $1.5 million for pain and suffering, plus $500,000 for each surviving spouse and eligible dependent. Another $5 million would be paid as a premium for going directly through the Edison plan. SCE officials say victims submitting claims would receive an offer in 90 days and payment 30 days after that -- much quicker than litigation.\n\nHowever, attorneys in the lawsuits allege the SCE program would pay survivors less than they could receive through litigation, which is scheduled for trial in January 2027.\n\nNewsom's office did not respond to an email requesting comment on the survivors network letter.",

    "title": "Justice Department sues to block California US House map in clash that could tip control of Congress",
    "body": "LOS ANGELES -- The Justice Department on Thursday sued to block new congressional district boundaries approved by California voters last week, joining a court battle that could help determine which party wins control of the U.S. House in 2026.\n\nThe complaint filed in California federal court targets the new congressional map pushed by Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom in response to a similar Republican-led effort in Texas backed by President Donald Trump. It sets the stage for a high-stakes legal and political fight between the Republican administration and the Democratic governor, who's seen as a likely 2028 presidential contender.\n\n\"California's redistricting scheme is a brazen power grab that tramples on civil rights and mocks the democratic process,\" Attorney General Pam Bondi said in an emailed statement. \"Governor Newsom's attempt to entrench one-party rule and silence millions of Californians will not stand.\"\n\nNewsom spokesperson Brandon Richards said in a statement, \"These losers lost at the ballot box and soon they will also lose in court.\"\n\nThe legal move against heavily Democratic California marks the first time the Justice Department has sued over a flurry of unusual, mid-decade House map revisions across the country that were drawn to maximize partisan advantage in advance of next year's elections.\n\nThree Republican-led states -- Texas, along with Missouri and North Carolina -- have not faced federal legal action after revamping district lines following Trump's call for new maps to expand GOP numbers in the House. Civil rights advocates have argued that the new boundaries in Texas and Missouri illegally disadvantage minority communities at the ballot box.\n\nCalifornia voters overwhelmingly approved Proposition 50, a constitutional amendment changing the congressional boundaries to give Democrats a shot at winning five seats now held by Republicans in next year's midterm elections.\n\nThe Justice Department is joining a case challenging the new map that was brought by the California Republican Party last week. The Trump administration accuses California of racial gerrymandering in violation of the Constitution by using race as a factor to favor Hispanic voters with the new map. It asks a judge to prohibit California from using the new map in any future elections.\n\n\"Race cannot be used as a proxy to advance political interests, but that is precisely what the California General Assembly did with Proposition 50 -- the recent ballot initiative that junked California's pre-existing electoral map in favor of a rush-job rejiggering of California's congressional district lines,\" the lawsuit says.\n\nProp 50 was Newsom's response to Trump's maneuvers in Texas, where Republicans rejiggered districts in hopes of picking up five seats of their own ahead of the 2026 midterm elections, when House control will be on the line.\n\nDemocrats need to gain just a handful of seats next year to take control of the chamber, which would imperil Trump's agenda for the remainder of his term and open the way for congressional investigations into his administration. Republicans hold 219 seats, to Democrats' 214.\n\nThe showdown between the nation's two most populous states has spread nationally, with Missouri, North Carolina and Ohio adopting new district lines that could provide a partisan advantage. Other states are considering similar moves.\n\nThe national implications of California's ballot measure were clear in both the money it attracted and the high-profile figures who became involved. Tens of millions of dollars flowed into the race, including a $5 million donation to opponents from the Congressional Leadership Fund, the super political action committee tied to House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La.\n\nFormer Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger opposed it, while former President Barack Obama, a Democrat, appeared in ads supporting it, calling it a \"smart\" approach to counter Republican moves aimed at safeguarding House control.\n\nThe contest provided Newsom with a national platform and he has confirmed he will consider a White House run in 2028.",

After the measure passed, he called it a \"GIANT SCAM\" and claimed the vote was unconstitutional.\n\nIn August, however, the president celebrated the passage of Texas' redistricting plan, writing on Truth Social at the time that more seats for Republicans in the U.S. House \"equals less Crime, a great Economy, and a STRONG SECOND AMENDMENT.\"\n\nIn next year's midterms, Democrats will be seeking to retake control of the House in the hopes of more effectively opposing the Trump administration, while Republicans will be vying to hold on to their narrow majority.",

Gavin Newsom he's some kind of world leader?\n\nA new documentary about the Palisades Fire of January shows California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass touring the Pacific Palisades as it burns behind them - with a contingent of Los Angeles Fire Department firefighters accompanying them instead of fighting the blaze.\n\nThe film, \"Paradise Abandoned,\" scheduled for release in December, is a reminder that the Palisades Fire will continue to haunt Bass as she seeks re-election - and Newsom as he seeks the presidency.\n\nNewsom addressed adoring crowds of Democrats in Houston over the weekend, even picking up a presidential endorsement or two, though he has not yet officially launched his campaign.\n\nHe is touting his success in passing Proposition 50 - which gerrymanders California's congressional districts for Democrats' benefit - as he casts himself as the leader of the party.\n\nMY HOUSE ALMOST BURNED DOWN IN THE PALISADES FIRE. ALLEGED ARSONIST IS NOT WHO I BLAME\n\nBut victims of wildfires back home are openly threatening to tank Newsom's political prospects unless he makes amends.\n\nAnd any change may already be too late for residents who have been forced to sell their lots because of a lack of support from the state.\n\n\"Paradise Abandoned\" claims authorities diverted firefighting resources during the fire, which burned over 36 square miles, destroyed nearly 7,000 structures and killed 12 people.\n\nIt notes that despite the fact that Pacific Palisades was situated in \"a region of maximum fire risk\" ahead of predicted extreme winds Jan. 7, not one additional fire truck was deployed to the area.\n\nResidents are shown having slipped past roadblocks on the second day of the still-burning fire to find out what happened to their homes.\n\nThey discover many have burned, with few firefighters in sight.\n\n\"The response is so f---ing minimal,\" one says.\n\nLA MAYOR BASS DELAYS PALISADES FIRE REPORT AT DOJ'S REQUEST AMID PROBE\n\nMeanwhile, the film notes, many fire trucks were stationed on the outer perimeter of the fire - or at a command post in a beach parking lot below the town, where they served as a backdrop for local officials to stage press conferences.\n\nOne resident recalls watching the Chase Bank building catch fire on the second day of the fire and burn completely through - while the governor and mayor toured the area.\n\n\"The mayor and the governor were in the middle of town, doing a news conference. And in the background, you see the Chase Bank building burning to the ground. They weren't doing anything.

    "title": "Justice Dept. Joins Lawsuit to Challenge California's New Redistricting Maps",
    "body": "The U.S. Justice Department has joined a Republican lawsuit challenging new congressional maps that California voters approved last week to favor Democrats in next year's midterm elections.\n\nThe case asserts that the maps, which were championed by Gov. Gavin Newsom, are unconstitutional because they improperly use voters' race as a factor in determining district boundaries. It was filed last week by the California Republican Party, and on Thursday the Justice Department announced it had filed to intervene in the suit asking the courts to block the maps.\n\n\"California's redistricting scheme is a brazen power grab that tramples on civil rights and mocks the democratic process,\" Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement. \"Governor Newsom's attempt to entrench one-party rule and silence millions of Californians will not stand.\"\n\nIt's the latest development in what has become a nationwide battle between Republican- and Democratic-controlled states to draw new congressional maps that could determine which party wins control of the House of Representatives next year. President Trump set off the unusual frenzy over the summer when he pressured Texas officials to gerrymander that state's maps to help Republicans. In the months since then, moves to draw new congressional districts have swept the nation.\n\nThe new California maps would make it easier for Democrats to win as many as five of California's congressional seats that are now held by Republicans. Mr. Newsom, a Democrat, drafted the plan as a response to the scheme in Texas, where Republicans approved new congressional maps that aim to take five seats away from Democrats. The California redistricting plan went before the state's voters last week as Proposition 50, and passed overwhelmingly with 64 percent of the vote.\n\n\"These losers lost at the ballot box and soon they will also lose in court,\" Mr. Newsom's press office wrote on social media in response to the Justice Department's announcement that it had joined the Republican lawsuit.\n\nRepublicans sued over the maps the day after the election, arguing that drafters had engaged in racial gerrymandering by drawing districts to empower Latino voters. Lawyers for the California Republican Party said the suit was being paid for by the National Republican Congressional Committee, the political arm of House Republicans.\n\nOn Monday, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee intervened on the side of Mr. Newsom, arguing that the maps affect its ability to \"elect Democratic candidates in California's congressional districts and achieve a majority in the House of Representatives.\" The organization is represented by the law firm of Marc Elias, one of the Democratic Party's top election lawyers.\n\nThe Republicans' lawsuit was filed by attorneys who work for a firm founded by Harmeet K. Dhillon, a longtime Republican activist who was appointed by Mr. Trump to run the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division. Ms. Dhillon has been recused from the case, according to an announcement from the Justice Department.",

    "title": "Newsom touts California's record battery energy gains at U.N. climate conference",
    "body": "This is read by an automated voice. Please report any issues or inconsistencies here.\n\nCalifornia added 1,200 megawatts of battery energy storage to its electrical grid over the last six months, further building on its nation-leading capacity and pushing the state closer to its clean energy goals, officials said Thursday.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom announced the latest milestone while making the rounds at the United Nations Conference of the Parties climate summit in Belém, Brazil, where he is touting the state's international climate leadership amid the notable absence of officials from the Trump administration.\n\nWith the latest additions, the Golden State has reached 16,942 megawatts of available battery storage -- about one-third of the estimated capacity needed to reach its goal of 100% clean energy by 2045.\n\nBattery energy storage systems capture excess wind and solar power and push it onto the grid during hours of peak demand, or when the sun isn't shining or the wind isn't blowing.\n\nNewsom used the announcement as an opportunity to swipe at President Trump, who has focused heavily on the growth of fossil fuels such as oil, gas and coal while simultaneously slashing funding for renewable energy projects in California and across the U.S.\n\n\"Donald Trump's reckless energy agenda puts China first and America last -- letting Beijing seize the global clean energy economy and the good-paying jobs, manufacturing, and economic prosperity that come with it,\" the governor said in a statement. \"California won't stand by and watch.\"\n\nWhile China continues to burn fossil fuels, the country is breaking global records with its investments in renewable energy and battery storage. In 2024, China commissioned 37 gigawatts of battery storage, more than the combined additions of the U.S. and Europe, according to the energy think tank Ember.\n\nBut battery storage has also been transformative for California, helping the state avoid rolling blackouts and urgent calls for energy conservation, known as Flex Alerts, in the last several years. California now has more installed battery capacity than any other jurisdiction on the planet except for China, according to Newsom.\n\n\"We now dominate,\" he said at a climate investors event in São Paulo on Monday before heading to Belém.\n\nExperts say the state's gains are impressive. The U.S. has about 37 gigawatts of total operating battery capacity, nearly half of which is in California, said Maia Leroy, founder of the energy consulting firm Lumenergy LLC.\n\n\"California is claiming a huge victory here,\" Leroy said. She said the state's capacity of 16,942 megawatts -- or 16.9 gigawatts -- is enough to power about 13 million homes for four hours, the typical duration of a battery.\n\nThe surge in storage is meeting with even faster growth of solar in the state. Together, solar plus batteries have eliminated more than 37% of fossil gas use on the state's main grid, the California Independent System Operator, in just the last two years, according to Mark Z. Jacobson, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Stanford University.\n\n\"That is an enormous amount of batteries,\" Jacobson said.\n\nEnergy storage is one of many ways California is hoping to stand out at this year's COP summit. Representatives from the state -- including Newsom, California Natural Resources Secretary Wade Crowfoot and Air Resources Board Chair Lauren Sanchez -- have also entered into several partnerships and agreements with other regions and nations this week.\n\nAmong them is the Global Energy Storage and Grids Pledge, an initiative started at last year's COP conference that sets a global target of deploying 1,500 gigawatts of energy storage and building about 15.5 million miles of new transmission infrastructure by 2030. California became the first subnational entity to join the pledge, which has been backed by more than 100 countries and organizations.\n\nThe pledge is a good start, but the world needs more than just storage and transmission, Jacobson said.\n\n\"California is moving faster than the U.S. as a whole, but to really make inroads, California needs to also electrify transport, industry and buildings as fast as it is building batteries, while growing offshore wind, utility solar, rooftop solar and enhanced geothermal,\" he said.\n\nThe state is working toward those goals, including pushing forward with a major offshore wind project that lost nearly half a billion dollars in federal funding from the Trump administration this year.\n\nOther agreements signed at COP so far this year include joint partnerships and memoranda of understanding with Colombia, Chile, Nigeria, the Brazilian state of Pará and the German state of Baden-Württemberg on issues such as wildfire prevention and response, sustainable urban transportation and greenhouse gas emission reductions.",

Gavin Newsom's former chief of staff in a corruption case involving a top aide to former Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra.\n\nNeither the term-limited governor nor Becerra, who is running to succeed Newsom, is accused of wrongdoing.\n\nBoth have spent the past day distancing themselves from the investigation into Dana Williamson, a longtime political strategist who was Newsom's chief of staff from early 2023 to November 2024, and Sean McCluskie, who was Becerra's chief of staff at HHS and his top deputy when Becerra was the state's attorney general.\n\nWilliamson was arrested on Wednesday in Sacramento on allegations of fraud, falsifying her tax returns and other charges, the most serious of which carry sentences of up to 20 years in prison. She pleaded not guilty and was released on a $500,000 bond.\n\nProsecutors allege in the 23-count indictment that Williamson conspired with McCluskie and others to divert roughly $225,000 from the dormant campaign account of \"Public Official 1,\" whom the indictment describes in terms that match Becerra, to McCluskie, disguising it as pay for work that never happened.\n\nWilliamson is also charged with falsifying and backdating contracts to justify Covid-era loans made to her business under the Paycheck Protection Program, claiming as tax deductions more than $1 million worth of personal expenses, including private jet travel, luxury hotel stays, designer handbags and cash payments to friends and family.\n\nMcCluskie recently entered into a plea agreement and agreed with the facts of the FBI's investigation. He faces up to five years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000, though he will likely receive lighter punishment because he is cooperating.\n\n\"Ms. Williamson no longer serves in this administration,\" a spokesperson for the governor said in a statement to MSNBC. \"While we are still learning details of the allegations, the Governor expects all public servants to uphold the highest standards of integrity.\"\n\nThe spokesperson said Williamson was placed on leave as soon as she informed the office last year she was under criminal investigation, adding that the alleged fraud did not take place while she served in the governor's office.\n\nBecerra said in a statement that the \"news of formal accusations of impropriety by a long-serving trusted advisor are a gut punch\" and added that he is voluntarily cooperating with the Justice Department in its investigation.",

    "body": "'The Big Weekend Show' panel discuss California Gov. Gavin Newsom's victory lap after the state passed Prop 50, which is expected to add more Democratic representation.\n\nThe Department of Justice intervened Thursday in a lawsuit against Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom that is challenging California's efforts to redraw the state's congressional map in time for the next election.\n\nDOJ Civil Rights Division lawyers argued in a complaint that race was \"used as a proxy\" in California to justify creating districts favorable to Democrats, a move that served to offset the redistricting showdown in Texas that resulted in more Republican-leaning districts.\n\n\"In the press, California's legislators and governor sold a plan to promote the interests of Democrats in the upcoming midterm elections,\" the DOJ lawyers wrote. \"But amongst themselves and on the debate floor, the focus was not partisanship, but race.\"\n\nCALIFORNIA REPUBLICANS SUE TO STOP NEWSOM, DEMOCRATS FROM PUSHING REDISTRICTING PLAN\n\nThey added the Constitution \"does not tolerate this racial gerrymander\" and cited several remarks from lawmakers and others involved in the process about how they prioritized creating a Latino-majority district to counter Texas' perceived attempt to \"silence the voices of Latino voters.\"\n\nThe federal government has authority to enforce the Voting Rights Act, which has a provision designed to make sure voters are not disenfranchised based on their race. But the law's language has long been a point of controversy and is now under review by the Supreme Court in a separate redistricting case about Louisiana's map.\n\nCalifornia's ballot measure, called Proposition 50, passed on Election Day, and clears the way for the state legislature to redraw districts that could flip five Republican seats. Newsom said in celebratory remarks after the measure's passage that it was California's answer to Trump \"trying to rig the midterm elections before one single vote is even cast.\"\n\n'DERANGED OBSESSION': NEWSOM HIT WITH LAWSUIT OVER 'RETALIATORY' CALIFORNIA REDISTRICTING PUSH\n\n\"One thing he never counted on, though, was the state of California,\" Newsom said. \"Instead of agonizing over the state of our nation. We organized in an unprecedented way, in a 90-day sprint.\"\n\nCalifornia Assembly member David Tangipa, a Republican, responded by suing, and the DOJ joined in that lawsuit Thursday.\n\nA spokesperson for Newsom told Fox News Digital: \"These losers lost at the ballot box and soon they will also lose in court.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe legal battle comes as redistricting fights have intensified in the lead-up to the 2026 midterm elections. In addition to Texas and California, Louisiana's fight before the Supreme Court could affect its map by the next election, depending on when the high court rules. In Utah, Republicans were just dealt a blow by a state judge who approved a new map that will tip one of the state's four districts in favor of Democrats.",

    "title": "A Sacramento scandal: Who's who and what's what",
    "body": "FALLOUT CONTINUES: Sacramento is roiling from the indictment of former Gavin Newsom chief of staff Dana Williamson and the various corrupt schemes she is accused of carrying out with other Capitol power players.\n\nThere seem to be almost unlimited threads to pull in the alleged campaign fund theft, tax and loan fraud and FBI false statement cases against Williamson, as well as allegations against Xavier Becerra's former longtime chief of staff Sean McCluskie and consultant Greg Campbell.\n\nJeremy B. White, who's covered many a Sacramento scandal, broke it down for us.\n\nWho are the people involved in the alleged schemes?\n\nWilliamson served in former Gov. Jerry Brown's administration, ran a powerful consulting firm, and was Newsom's chief of staff for nearly two years until late last year. She is well-known in Sacramento as an aggressive operator with experience in brokering high-level deals. Her hard-charging style at times fomented conflict with lawmakers and interest groups.\n\nThe government alleges Williamson was working with Campbell, a prominent lobbyist who previously served as chief of staff to two Assembly speakers -- he was known to be a bare-knuckled enforcer -- before launching a consulting firm. Campbell and Williamson in 2020 collaborated on a novel alliance of consulting firms called The Collaborative.\n\nAnother central figure in the indictment is McCluskie, who had worked for Becerra -- a former California attorney general and Health and Human Services secretary -- for many years, dating back to his days in Congress.\n\nMcCluskie has accepted a plea deal in which he admits to bank and wire fraud. Campbell has accepted a plea deal in which he admits to bank and wire fraud and to a conspiracy to defraud the United States. Williamson entered a not guilty plea in federal court on Wednesday.\n\nMcCluskey's lawyer declined to comment. An attorney for Campbell said his client \"takes full accountability for his actions and is cooperating fully with the legal process.\"\n\nAre any elected officials implicated?\n\nThe indictment does not allege wrongdoing by elected officials. While Becerra is referenced repeatedly -- though not by name -- because his campaign funds were allegedly being stolen by his chief of staff, the court documents show the co-conspirators working to mislead him.\n\nNewsom is also not implicated in the documents. The governor's office has said Newsom became aware of the investigation last November and immediately placed Williamson on leave. She officially left the office a month later.\n\nWilliamson's attorney, who blasted her arrest as \"grandstanding,\" now alleges that prosecutors sought her help with an investigation into Newsom, but said \"she had no information to give them or offer them because she had not seen any misconduct by the governor of any kind.\" The governor's chief of staff said Wednesday there was \"no basis for any federal investigation into the governor.\"\n\nWhat's happened with Becerra's campaign funds?\n\nThe government alleges that Williamson, who worked on Becerra's 2018 and 2022 attorney general campaigns, worked with Campbell and McCluskie to funnel roughly $225,000 from Becerra's dormant state campaign account to McCluskie. It describes McCluskie saying he took a pay cut when he followed his boss from the California Department of Justice to HHS in 2021 and that he needed the additional funds to pay for airline travel so he wouldn't have to relocate to Washington. His federal salary at the time was about $183,000.\n\nThe payments were represented as covering consulting and account management costs, which were then passed along to cover a \"no-show\" job for McCluskie's wife, but the federal government says the funds were passed back to McCluskie.\n\nWhat about the tax and loan fraud?\n\nWilliamson is also accused of misleading the federal government when it was looking into a Paycheck Protection Program loan her consulting firm obtained during the Covid pandemic.\n\nAccording to the indictment, Campbell, at Williamson's behest, drew up contracts and backdated them to \"falsely indicate\" they were executed years earlier.\n\nThe indictment also alleges Williamson repeatedly underreported her taxable income by creating $1 million worth of \"false business deductions\" for personal expenditures including luxury items, hotel stays and a home HVAC unit.\n\nWhat triggered the federal investigation into Williamson and others?\n\nIt isn't clear. But the indictment describes the co-conspirators making false statements or omissions to the media, and it references Williamson approving a statement to a journalist that matches, in the wording of the statement and the timing of the story, a POLITICO piece that referenced the payments from Becerra's dormant account.\n\n-- with help from Nicole Norman\n\nIT'S THURSDAY AFTERNOON.

Facing a possible midterm race in newly drawn blue territory, Sacramento-area Republican Rep. Kevin Kiley is joining Democratic Bay Area Rep. Sam Liccardo to push legislation that would temporarily extend Obamacare subsidies while Congress crafts a longer-term solution.\n\nAs Rachel Bluth reports in her coverage of Democrats angry about the lack of subsidy extensions in the freshly signed shutdown agreement, the bipartisan duo introduced their proposal just hours before the Senate's Monday vote.\n\nThe legislation borrows from other bipartisan bills that have been introduced but gone nowhere. It extends the subsidies for two years, and with stricter income requirements.\n\n\"We needed to end the shutdown, that was very clear. Things were getting worse and worse every day,\" Kiley said. \"I do think the fact that you are seeing a strong level of bipartisan interest in the subsidies created an environment where ending things was easier.\"\n\nRENT REVAMP: For the first time in decades, the Los Angeles City Council overhauled its rent control rules on Wednesday, sharply lowering the annual rent increases facing tenants in one of the country's most expensive cities, Liam Dillon reports.\n\nThe decision follows years of debate over how heavy a hand the city should have in regulating its sprawling rental market as living costs have soared and the gap between rich and poor has widened. It comes amid a national focus on affordability punctuated by New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, who won a decisive victory last week after running an outsider campaign centered on a promise to \"freeze the rent\" for that city's tenants.\n\nUnder the new rules, Los Angeles landlords whose buildings are covered by the city's rent stabilization laws -- about three-quarters of the market -- will be allowed to increase rents by between just 1 percent and 4 percent each year, depending on inflation. Currently, landlords are allowed to increase rent between 3 percent and 8 percent annually.\n\n-- The ACLU is suing the Santa Clara County District Attorney's Office over charging data that the civil-liberties group says it needs in order to evaluate how race impacts charging and sentencing decisions in the South Bay.

The measure allows Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) to circumvent the state's nonpartisan redistricting commission to redraw the map for three elections but returns redistricting authority to the commission after the 2030 Census.\n\n\"Newsom should be concerned about keeping Californians safe and shutting down Antifa violence, not rigging his state for political gain,\" Attorney General Pam Bondi wrote in a post on X.\n\nThe Justice Department is joining a suit filed in federal court this month by California Assembly member David Tangipa (R), who alleged in his filing that the new congressional map, which adds five more Democratic-leaning districts, violates the 14th and 15th Amendments' protections against racial gerrymandering.\n\nBondi filed a motion to join the case Thursday, asserting that the case is \"of general public importance.\" The Justice Department declined to comment on the suit. Representatives for Newsom didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nNewsom and Democrats in California's legislature set out to redistrict to counteract Texas's new congressional map, drawn at Trump's behest to try to shore up or expand Republicans' narrow House majority next year. In addition to Texas, which approved its new map in August, the GOP has drawn new maps in Missouri, North Carolina and Ohio. Democrats have kicked off a months-long process to draw a new Virginia congressional map and are trying to block the Missouri map from taking effect.\n\nOther states are discussing redistricting, but The Washington Post previously reported some Republican resistance to those efforts in Indiana and Kansas, while some Democrats have pushed back against new maps in Illinois and Maryland.",

Williamson's alleged misdeeds occurred in private work prior to her joining his staff, and his office said it placed her on leave in November 2024 after she informed him she was under investigation.\n\nNonetheless, the bombshell allegations struck at the center of the political power circle surrounding Newsom, rattling one of the nation's most prominent and important hubs of Democratic state power at a time when President Trump and his Republican administration wield power in Washington.\n\nWilliamson was charged with bank and tax fraud for allegedly siphoning campaign and COVID-19 recovery funds into her and an associate's pockets and claiming personal luxuries as business expenses on tax forms. According to the indictment, the campaign funds were drawn from a dormant state account of another top California Democrat: gubernatorial candidate and former U.S. Health and Human Services secretary Xavier Becerra.\n\nTwo other well-connected aides in state politics were also charged -- and struck plea deals confirming the scheme -- while a third, with deep ties to one of the most well-connected circles of political and business consultants in the country, appeared in charging documents as an uncharged co-conspirator.\n\nWilliamson's attorney McGregor Scott, a former U.S. attorney in Sacramento, told The Times on Wednesday that federal authorities had approached Williamson more than a year ago, seeking help with some kind of probe of the governor himself.\n\n\"She told them she had no information to provide them, and then we wind up today with these charges,\" Scott said. The nature of that alleged probe is unclear.\n\nNewsom's office on Thursday said it was \"not aware of any federal investigation involving the governor.\"\n\nLauren Horwood, a spokesperson for the U.S. attorney's office in Sacramento, said she could not confirm or deny the existence of any investigation involving Newsom, in accordance with Justice Department policy. None of the charging documents released in the cases against the three aides mention Newsom.\n\nA loquacious liberal foil to Trump and likely 2028 presidential contender, Newsom has been in Brazil since Sunday and on Thursday left for a planned trip into the Amazon with a small delegation after attending the United Nations climate summit known as COP30. He left the conference before news of Williamson's arrest, and could not be reached directly by The Times for comment.\n\nIn his absence, Newsom's representatives have tried to draw a connection between the federal case and the contentious relationship between California and the Trump administration, though offered no evidence that the investigation was influenced by the White House.\n\n\"At a time when the president is openly calling for his attorney general to investigate his political enemies, it is especially important to honor the American principle of being innocent until proven guilty in a court of law by a jury of one's peers,\" a Newsom spokesperson said Wednesday.\n\n\"Under the Trump administration, the DOJ routinely targets the state, which has resulted in us suing the federal administration 46 times,\" a Newsom spokesperson said Thursday.\n\nTrump and his administration have been accused of using their power -- and control over the Justice Department -- to go after his political enemies. Charges reportedly deemed weak and unfounded by career prosecutors have been brought forward anyway against former FBI Director James Comey and New York Atty. Gen. Letitia James, while Sen. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) is being investigated for years-old occupancy claims in mortgage documents. All have denied wrongdoing.\n\nThe case against Williamson and the other California aides, however, is something different -- originating years ago under the Biden administration.\n\n\"Today's charges are the result of three years of relentless investigative work, in partnership with IRS Criminal Investigation and the U.S. Attorney's Office,\" FBI Sacramento Special Agent in Charge Sid Patel said Wednesday.\n\nAbigail Jackson, a White House spokesperson, rejected the notion that the case was in any way driven by the Trump administration or politically motivated.\n\n\"What an absurd claim to make when public reporting has already noted that this investigation began under the Biden DOJ,\" Jackson said. \"The Trump administration is restoring integrity and accountability to the Justice Department.\"\n\nProsecutors also have plea deals with two of the primary suspects in the case, in which they corroborate some of the allegations.\n\nAccording to the 23-count indictment, unsealed Wednesday morning, Williamson conspired with Sean McCluskie -- a former top aid to Becerra -- and lobbyist Greg Campbell to bill Becerra's dormant state campaign account for bogus consulting services. The three allegedly used shell companies to funnel money out of the campaign fund starting in 2022.\n\nFederal authorities alleged the bulk of the payments were made to McCluskie's wife, who did not actually provide consulting services, and deposited into an account accessed by McCluskie. Becerra, who has not been accused of wrongdoing, said Wednesday's charges alleging \"impropriety by a long-serving trusted advisor are a gut punch,\" and that he was cooperating with authorities.\n\nIn addition, Williamson was charged with falsifying documents for a COVID-era small business loan, and with claiming luxury goods and services -- including a $15,353 Chanel purse, $21,000 in private jet travel and a $150,000 birthday trip to Mexico, complete with an $11,000 yacht trip -- as business expenses on her tax returns, federal prosecutors said.\n\nWilliamson appeared in federal court in Sacramento on Wednesday afternoon, and pleaded not guilty to the charges.\n\nWilliamson's attorney said he has been in \"regular communication\" with federal prosecutors about the case for some time, and had asked to meet with prosecutors to \"present our side\" before any charges were brought, but that request \"was not honored.\"\n\nInstead, officials \"chose grandstanding instead of the normal process\" and arrested Williamson at home Wednesday, despite her being seriously ill and in need of a liver transplant, Scott said. Williamson could not be reached for comment directly.\n\nWilliamson previously worked as a Cabinet secretary to former Gov. Jerry Brown, who also could not be reached for comment Thursday.\n\nThe case against Williamson is bolstered by acknowledgments of guilt from at least two others.\n\nMcCluskie -- a former chief deputy attorney general of California when Becerra was attorney general -- pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit fraud and is cooperating with authorities, court filings show. He could not be reached for comment.\n\nCampbell pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit fraud and conspiracy to defraud and commit offenses against the U.S. government. Campbell's attorney Todd Pickles said his client \"takes full accountability for his actions and is cooperating fully with the legal process.\"\n\nThe case also involves another longtime California political insider: Alexis Podesta, a former secretary of the California Business, Consumer Services and Housing Agency who Newsom appointed to the State Compensation Insurance Fund board of directors in January 2020. A spokesperson for the board confirmed Podesta remained a member as of Thursday morning.\n\nBill Portanova, Podesta's attorney, confirmed to The Times that Podesta is the person identified as \"Co-Conspirator 2\" in charging documents -- including McCluskie's plea agreement, which alleges she funneled the campaign funds to him.\n\nPortanova said Podesta inherited responsibilities for handling the Becerra account from Williamson when Williamson left to become Newsom's chief of staff. Podesta did not perceive anything \"unusual about the accounts, how they were set up or who had set them up,\" so continued making payments as previously arranged, Portanova said.\n\nHowever, \"when confronted with the information that it was improper payments,\" Portanova said, she immediately stopped the payments, and \"has been fully cooperative with the federal authorities at every stage of these proceedings.\"\n\nHe said she is not charged, and \"should not be charged\" moving forward. He otherwise declined to comment, as \"investigations are ongoing.\"\n\nPodesta had close ties to some of the most influential Democratic political consultants in California, adding to the intrigue surrounding the case.\n\nIn September 2020 -- about eight months after Newsom had appointed Podesta to the insurance board for workers' compensation -- Politico reported on a new \"influence superteam\" of Democratic political consultants forming in California.\n\nThe project, it said, would be called the Collaborative. Among its \"architects\" were Williamson and Campbell, as well as Jim DeBoo, another former Newsom chief of staff. Its managing director, the outlet reported, would be Podesta.\n\nAmong its enlisted consultants, it said, would be Sean Clegg of Bearstar Strategies, another former senior advisor to Newsom, and Shannon Murphy, of M Strategic Communications, which has ties to Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass.\n\nDeBoo, Clegg and Murphy have not been accused of any wrongdoing.\n\n\"Bearstar participated in a joint marketing press release with the Collaborative and worked on one campaign with the Collaborative's members in 2022. Bearstar and its partners had no interest, stake or other involvement with this entity,\" David Beltran, a representative of Bearstar, said in a statement Thursday.\n\nMurphy also released a statement about the enterprise: \"Five years ago, our firm participated in a joint-marketing effort. We had zero ownership or role in the business entity that was created and had no knowledge of its finances or operations until yesterday's news stories.\"\n\nDeBoo did not respond to requests for comment Thursday.\n\nMembers of the Collaborative advise some of the largest companies in not just the country, but the world.\n\nThe Collaborative's website was recently scaled down to a simple landing page, but it previously touted itself there as \"the hub for the most talented public affairs, campaign, crisis management, communications and lobbying firms in California,\" providing clients \"the ability to choose one or several firms that work together -- rather than compete -- to provide their clients with the best possible outcomes.\"\n\nThe website led with what it called a proverb: \"If you call one wolf, you invite the pack.\"",

    "title": "AP Interview: Newsom says Trump climate-fighting absence is 'doubling down on stupid'",
    "body": "BELEM, Brazil -- Calling America's absence from key United Nations climate negotiations \"doubling down on stupid,\" California Gov. Gavin Newsom said Tuesday the United States risks being left behind as an economic power.\n\nNewsom, a Democrat eyeing a 2028 presidential run, is so far the highest profile of several U.S. governors and mayors at U.N. climate talks being hosted in Belem, Brazil. They say they are here to tell the 195 nations who are trying to fight climate change that much of the United States is doing its best despite Trump administration policies overturning environmental regulations and aiding the production of dirty fuels, such as coal, while stymying green energies like wind and solar.\n\nAs he did during his first term, President Donald Trump is also pulling America from the 2015 Paris Agreement, which set international goals to limit average global temperature rise.\n\nNewsom's presence as governor of the most populous U.S. state serves to draw a clear contrast with Trump's absence. He said Trump's decision to skip the talks tells the world: \"You don't matter, we don't care.\"\n\n\"This idea that somehow we can put up walls, we can put up barriers, we could put up tariffs, we put up our middle fingers and just turn our back is lunacy,\" Newsom said during an exclusive Associated Press interview at the climate talks in Belem, a city on the edge of the Amazon rainforest. \"And every other country in the world understands that. That's why every other country in this world is moving in a different direction.\"\n\nEven Russia and Saudi Arabia get it and are going green, but not Trump, Newsom said. U.N. organizers said only four nations are absent from the negotiations called COP30: Strife-torn Afghanistan and Myanmar, tiny San Marino and the United States, which over the century has put more heat-trapping carbon dioxide in the air than any other nation.\n\nCalifornia, with nearly 40 million residents, is a major economic hub and on the forefront of national climate policy. But the Trump administration has sought to roll back the state's power to set aggressive climate policy, most notably by blocking a California regulation to ban the sale of new gas-powered cars within the next decade.\n\n\"This Trump administration, his acolytes and the supine Congress led by Speaker (Mike) Johnson, are doubling down on stupid,\" Newsom said.\n\n\"We're ceding cheap energy, green energy, infrastructure, supply chain manufacturing. We're ceding economic power to other countries, notably China, taking advantage of that absence,\" Newsom said. \"And they're going to clean our clock economically unless we wake up to the economic imperative and opportunities of low carbon regrowth.\"\n\nTrump, who actively solicited money from the fossil fuel industry during his last campaign, has massively deregulated industry that spews heat-trapping gas and cut subsidies to renewable energy. This would give America -- the No. 1 oil producer in the world -- energy independence and cheaper prices, he has said.\n\n\"Governor Newscum flew all the way to Brazil to tout the Green New Scam, while the people of California are paying some of the highest energy prices in the country. Embarrassing!,\" White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said in a statement, using one of Trump's favored nicknames for Newsom. \"President Trump will not allow the best interest of the American people to be jeopardized by the Green Energy Scam. These Green Dreams are killing other countries, but will not kill ours thanks to President Trump's common sense energy agenda.\"\n\nClimate change is undeniable, despite Trump calling it a hoax, Newsom said.\n\n\"If you don't believe in science, and a lot of people apparently don't, you have to believe in your own eyes,\" Newsom said. \"Nighttime temperatures, record-breaking heat globally, acidification of our oceans, impacts on our coral reefs. You're not able to go where your grandfather brought you for the first time, your dad brought you and bring your kids because there's another fire and it's another closure and the air quality's been degraded.\"\n\nCalifornia has warmed 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit (1 degree Celsius) in the past 30 years and gets nearly 7 inches of rain (17.7 centimeters) less now than it did in 1995, according to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration records.\n\nSome of California's largest and most destructive wildfires in history have sparked in the last five years, including two January infernos that devastated neighborhoods in and around Los Angeles. The previous winter, meanwhile, brought record-breaking rainfall as multiple atmospheric rivers pounded the state.\n\n\"I'm just privileged to represent one of the most blessed and cursed states in the world that's on the tip of the spear of the impacts of climate change,\" Newsom said. \"How about the simultaneous crisis of wildfires, drought, and floods stacked on top of each other.\"\n\n\"Anyone paying attention here?\" added Newsom.\n\nAt home, Newsom has confronted the economic and political realities of pursuing the state's ambitious goal of by 2045 reaching carbon neutrality, or taking as much carbon pollution from the atmosphere as emitted. He recently signed legislation to boost oil production in part of the state, and his party has grappled with how to confront high gas prices. California also has some of the highest electricity rates in the country.\n\nCalifornia is also dealing with the massive energy and water demands of data centers by keeping its last nuclear plant running longer than planned, adding huge chunks of solar power and battery storage and investing in nuclear fusion, Newsom said. Those energy needs will grow as AI continues to boom. Many of the nation's top AI companies are headquartered in California.\n\nVeteran climate negotiations analyst Alden Meyer of the European think tank E3G said it was unfortunate that America's federal government was not participating in the talks.\n\n\"But it is very positive that we have these other leaders from the United States that are here in Belem,\" he said.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Anton L.

    "title": "California to revoke 17,000 commercial driver's licenses given to immigrants amid Trump admin pressure",
    "body": "Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier joins 'Fox & Friends' to discuss reports that California issued trucking licenses to illegal immigrants and how Florida plans to respond.\n\nCalifornia is set to revoke commercial driver's licenses (CDLs) issued to 17,000 immigrants after pressure from the Trump administration.\n\nThe licenses that are expected to be revoked would have expired after the driver was legally allowed to be in the country.\n\n\"After weeks of claiming they did nothing wrong, Gavin Newsom and California have been caught red-handed. Now that we've exposed their lies, 17,000 illegally issued trucking licenses are being revoked,\" Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a statement. \"This is just the tip of the iceberg. My team will continue to force California to prove they have removed every illegal immigrant from behind the wheel of semi-trucks and school buses.\"\n\nThe Transportation Department said that those impacted by the decision have been notified that their licenses no longer meet federal requirements and will expire in 60 days. However, California Gov. Gavin Newsom's office said in a post on X that the federal requirements referenced were not in effect when the licenses were issued.\n\nEXPERT REVEALS HOW ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT TRUCKER MAY HAVE GOTTEN COMMERCIAL LICENSE BEFORE FATAL FLORIDA CRASH\n\nIn the scathing social media post, Newsom's office slammed Duffy over the Transportation Department's statement on the matter, highlighting each point that it deemed to be a \"lie.\"\n\nThe first point that Newsom's office pushed back on was the department's assertion that the California Department of Motor Vehicles \"admitted to illegally issuing\" the 17,000 CDLs in question. Newsom's office claims that the licenses were withdrawn because they were inconsistent with California law.\n\nNewsom's office also rejected the department's statement that the drivers who received the licenses were illegal immigrants, saying that they were present in the U.S. legally and \"had been granted work authorization by the federal government.\"\n\nAdditionally, Newsom's office disputed the claim that the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration's (FMCSA) analysis showed that \"more than one in four of the non-domiciled CDL records sampled in California failed to comply with federal regulations.\" The California governor's office claimed that FMCSA's analysis was \"based on retroactive application of its new rules\" and said \"FMCSA also faults California for following guidance explicitly approved by DHS.\"\n\nDuffy, however, hit back, saying, \"We've said all along, [DOT] is reprimanding California for violating [FMCSA's] ORIGINAL rules.\"\n\n\"My emergency rule came as a consequence in part for California's total disregard of those federal laws -- it was THAT BAD,\" Duffy added.\n\nBLUE STATES DEFLECT BLAME IN TRUMP PROBE AFTER ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT TRUCKER CRASH KILLS 3 IN FLORIDA\n\nCalifornia's move to revoke the licenses came just one day before Harjinder Singh, who crossed into the United States illegally in 2018 and is accused of causing a fatal accident that left three people dead, faced a docket call hearing as the court reviews discovery issues and interpreter concerns.\n\nSingh was charged with three counts of vehicular homicide after he allegedly attempted to make an illegal U-turn through an \"Official Use Only\" access point in Fort Pierce, Fla. When making the turn, Singh allegedly caused what Homeland Security called a \"brutal wreck.\" In August, Singh was extradited from California to Florida, where the accident took place.\n\nJust days after the accident, officials investigating the wreck said that Singh failed English and road sign tests.\n\nBLUE STATE INVESTIGATES HOW ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT TRUCKER GOT LICENSE BEFORE DEADLY FLORIDA CRASH\n\n\"During [FMCSA's] interview with the driver, investigators administered an English Language Proficiency (ELP) assessment in accordance with FMCSA guidance,\" the Department of Transportation said in a statement. \"The driver failed the assessment, providing correct responses to just 2 of 12 verbal questions and only accurately identifying 1 of 4 highway traffic signs.\"\n\nIn another instance, Jashanpreet Singh, an illegal immigrant from India who received a CDL from California, was charged with vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated and driving under the influence after allegedly driving while intoxicated and causing a crash that left three people dead.\n\nMultiple federal law enforcement sources told Fox News that Singh was first encountered by Border Patrol agents in California's El Centro Sector in March 2022 and released into the interior of the country pending an immigration hearing.\n\nCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nPolice say Singh never hit the brakes before slamming into the traffic jam, citing toxicology tests that confirmed impairment.\n\nFox News Digital's Peter D'Abrosca and Jasmine Baehr and Fox News' Bill Melugin contributed to this report.",

    "title": "Ex-aide to California governor indicted for alleged theft of campaign funds from ex-health secretary",
    "body": "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- A former top aide to California Gov. Gavin Newsom has been indicted on federal charges alleging her involvement in a scheme to steal campaign money from former federal Health Secretary Xavier Becerra.\n\nDana Williamson was arrested and appeared in court Wednesday in Sacramento. She pleaded not guilty to all charges, and a judge ordered her released from custody.\n\nThe federal indictment lists four other co-conspirators. It alleges that Williamson developed a plan with Sean McCluskie, a longtime Becerra aide, to siphon money from one of Becerra's dormant state campaign accounts to give to McCluskie to pad his salary after he accepted a job as his chief of staff in Washington.\n\nMcCluskie signed a plea agreement Oct. 30 in which he admitted to one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud and wire fraud, according to court filings. He agreed to pay back the $225,000 he took from the account.\n\nMcCluskie's attorney Daniel Olmos declined to comment.\n\nBecerra is a former member of Congress who was appointed California attorney general in 2017 to fill a vacancy and reelected in 2018 with Williamson running his campaign. Former President Joe Biden later appointed him as secretary of Health and Human Services, and he is now running for California governor in next year's election. He is not implicated in the indictment.\n\n\"The news today of formal accusations of impropriety by a long-serving trusted advisor are a gut punch,\" Becerra said in a statement, adding that he voluntarily cooperated with the Department of Justice in its investigation and will continue doing so.\n\nAccording to the indictment, she began helping McCluskie in April 2022 by using her political consulting company to bill Becerra's campaign account for purported services. The money would then be sent to McCluskie's wife for work supposedly done for Williamson.\n\nWhen Williamson prepared to join Newsom's office in late 2022, she is said to have arranged for \"Co-Conspirator 2\" -- an unnamed former public official -- to take over her role in the scheme.\n\nWilliamson told the Los Angeles Times that year that she planned to sever financial ties to her company while working for the governor. However the indictment includes details of emails, calls, and meetings between her and McCluskie regarding the alleged scheme and cover-up while she was Newsom's chief of staff, a position she held until late 2024.\n\nIn a statement, a spokesperson for Newsom said: \"Ms. Williamson no longer serves in this administration. While we are still learning details of the allegations, the Governor expects all public servants to uphold the highest standards of integrity.\"\n\nWilliamson is a longtime Democratic power player in Sacramento known for her savvy and aggressive style, often unafraid to spar publicly and privately with those who disagree with her. She was a Cabinet secretary for former Gov. Jerry Brown before opening her own political affairs firm and later rejoined state government as Newsom's chief of staff.\n\nWilliamson faces 23 charges including some involving the falsification of business contracts related to Paycheck Protection Program loans that her business received during the COVID-19 pandemic. She allegedly asked a co-conspirator to create a retroactive contract saying her company provided services to his company so she would be eligible for the loans and loan forgiveness.\n\nThe indictment accuses Williamson of filing fraudulent tax forms for her business from 2021 to 2023 claiming more than $1 million in business deductions for personal expenses, including luxury handbags and jewelry; private jet travel; vacations in Mexico; installation of a home HVAC system; and several hundred thousand dollars paid to various relatives for fake jobs.\n\nShe could face up to 20 years in prison if convicted.\n\nDuring her court appearance, Williamson wore a large gray coat with black glasses and had her hair pulled back in a bun. At one point she appeared to tear up after answering \"yes\" to questions from Judge Carolyn Delaney. Matthew Rowan, her attorney, declined to comment further.\n\nThe investigation began under the Biden administration more than three years ago, FBI Sacramento Special Agent in Charge Sid Patel said in a statement.\n\nThe charges against Williamson include conspiracy to commit bank and wire fraud, bank fraud, wire fraud, conspiracy to defraud the United States and obstruct justice, subscribing to false tax returns and making false statements.\n\nThe scheme began after McCluskie agreed to take the job as Becerra's chief of staff in 2022, a role that resulted in a pay cut of roughly $180,000, according to his plea agreement.\n\nThe FBI recorded and surveilled a meeting between Williamson and two other co-conspirators in July 2024, according to the plea deal. One unnamed co-conspirator who took over handling the payments from Williamson said she did not want to continue. The three discussed how to end the arrangement so as not to attract attention.\n\nSeveral days later two of the people involved met, and one acknowledged that the arrangement was \"always set up to be somewhat icky\" and amounted to \"laundering money,\" according to the plea deal. The co-conspirator handling the payments stopped making them shortly after. Several weeks later, McCluskie asked for the payments to resume while he tried to find a job outside the federal government. He said the money helped pay for plane tickets to fly back and forth between California and Washington.\n\nThe other named co-conspirator was lobbyist Greg Campbell. He also signed a plea deal admitting to one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud and wire fraud and one count of conspiracy to defraud the United States. Campbell used his company as a conduit for the campaign money to obscure that it was going to McCluskie's wife.\n\nTodd Pickles, Campbell's attorney, said he \"takes full accountability for his actions and is cooperating fully with the legal process.\" He added that the charges do not involve any lobbying or advocacy work by Campbell on behalf of any client.\n\nAs part of her conditions for release, Williamson will have to surrender her passport and is prohibited from consuming alcohol or drugs. She also cannot contact any of the co-conspirators. Her lawyer said in court that her health is in a \"precarious situation\" but did not give details.",

    "body": "Californians voted to redraw the state's congressional maps with Democratic lawmakers.\n\nThe Justice Department is joining a lawsuit against California Gov. Gavin Newsom over the redrawing of the state's congressional districts ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.\n\nThe Trump administration accuses California of violating the Constitution by gerrymandering using race as a factor to favor Hispanic voters in the new map. It asked a federal judge on Nov. 13 to prohibit California from using the new map in any future elections.\n\n\"Race cannot be used as a proxy to advance political interests, but that is precisely what the California General Assembly did with Proposition 50 -- the recent ballot initiative that junked California's pre-existing electoral map in favor of a rush-job rejiggering of California's congressional district lines,\" the lawsuit states.\n\nVoters overwhelmingly approved using the new map in the Nov. 4 election, agreeing to go back to non-gerrymandered districts after the 2030 Census.\n\nThe Justice Department wants to join a lawsuit filed shortly after the election by the California Republican Party.\n\nOn social media, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said the Justice Department sued Newsom over \"his brazen Proposition 50 redistricting power grab.\"\n\n\"Newsom should be concerned about keeping Californians safe and shutting down Antifa violence, not rigging his state for political gain,\" Bondi said.\n\nCalifornia's move to redraw district boundaries came in response to the Texas Legislature redrawing districts to be more friendly to Republicans. Several lawsuits have been brought over that effort and have not been joined by the Justice Department.\n\nA few other states have redrawn their district boundaries in what has become a race to use voter makeup to help determine which party controls the House after the 2026 elections.\n\nSarah D.

    "body": "The Justice Department on Thursday joined a lawsuit challenging California's new congressional map, saying the state was too focused on race when it drew its new lines.\n\nThe government sided with California voters and the California Republican Party, which sued last week to try to block the map that voters approved in the recent election.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom and fellow Democrats, who control the state, drew the map to cut Republicans' share of the congressional delegation from nine down to four seats, out of 52.\n\nBut the legislature, which drew up the map and put it to voters in a referendum last week, cast the debate as one of racial representation as much as political parties, the Justice Department said. The result was a map that took pains to carve out Hispanic-heavy districts to counter Texas, which earlier this year redistricted away several majority-minority districts in its state.\n\nThe Justice Department said that focusing on race makes the maps invalid.\n\n\"Our Constitution does not tolerate this racial gerrymander,\" the department said in its intervening complaint.\n\nIt asked the federal court in Los Angeles to block the use of the maps for next year's election and into the future.\n\nThe department's lawyers pointed to one newly drawn district that was crafted to snare Hispanic voters, including Republican areas, while leaving White Democrats out.\n\nThey said if the goal was purely party politics, those White Democrats would have been roped into the same district with the Hispanic voters, and the Hispanic GOP areas would have been left out.\n\nThe referendum to adopt the new map won easily, with roughly 65% of the vote.",

    "title": "Arrests of political aides could blow back on Newsom and Becerra",
    "body": "Before this month's arrests of former top state aides, it was a foregone conclusion that at least one or two Democrats would have to drop out of the ongoing run for California governor just to ensure there will be no Republican-on-Republican runoff next November 3.\n\nBut the dropouts until now did not figure to include Xavier Becerra, a former California attorney general and Health secretary in the cabinet of ex-President Joe Biden.\n\nHis onetime top aide, Sean McCluskie, is charged with sending fake bills to a dormant Becerra campaign bank account, along with Dana Williamson, a former top assistant to current Gov. Gavin Newsom and former Govs. Jerry Brown and Gray Davis.\n\nBecerra was not implicated in trying to extract funds from his inactive campaign account, which can possibly be used in the future for his political purposes. But his lack of acumen as a judge of the aide's character might weaken him sufficiently to drive him out of the current race.\n\nIt is the latest example of this fall's epidemic of candidate self-destruction, following early Democratic leader and former Orange County Congresswoman Katie Porter's mishandling of a television interview and Republican Steve Hilton's sending out a press release criticizing Newsom for actions that had earlier been proven sound.\n\nBecerra was tied for third at 8 percent in recent polling on the race, even with Hilton and just three points behind Porter's 11 percent as the early leader among Democrats.\n\nNewsom could be accused of similar poor judgment of character. His former top aide Dana Williamson was also indicted for falsely billing the inactive Becerra account and for claiming business expense tax writeoffs for an expensive vacation, a private airplane flight and even the purchase of a $10,000 luxury purse.\n\nNewsom, in Brazil for a climate change conference when the arrests came, cautioned against assuming the former top state aides are guilty of anything, even though investigations into them began during the Biden administration.\n\nHis office issued a statement saying \"The governor expects all public servants to uphold the highest standards of integrity. At a time when the president is openly calling for his attorney general to investigate his political enemies, it is especially important to honor the American principle of being innocent until proven guilty in a court of law...\"\n\nThe former aides pleaded not guilty.\n\nNewsom first learned Williamson, then his chief of staff, was under investigation in November of last year, and immediately relieved her of her duties. Newsom is not implicated in any wrongdoing and has not allowed the affair to interfere either with his duties as governor or his nascent 2028 presidential campaign.\n\nBecerra said he has cooperated fully with federal officials in the investigation of former chief of staff McCluskie and lobbyist Greg Campbell. He is also not implicated in any wrongdoing or misuse of the campaign account, which dates from his years as state attorney general.\n\nThe entire episode combines with the self-destructive behavior of other candidates to emphasize the instability of today's run for governor and the early days of the next presidential campaign. No one knows if any other federal investigations might similarly affect current candidates for governor, including the current poll leader, Republican Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco and former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, former state Controller Betty Yee, state schools Supt. Tony Thurmond and former state Assembly majority leader Ian Calderon.\n\nIf Becerra were to drop out, chances are his largely Latino base of support would fall to Villaraigosa, the only other Hispanic in the race.\n\nThat would give Villaraigosa, usually a pragmatist during his two terms as mayor and his time as state Assembly speaker, a major leg up on others left in the race and likely avoid Republicans taking the two leading slots in the state's non-partisan Top Two primary next June.\n\nBut the arrests leave a lot unknown and much to be learned once the former leading state aides head to trial. No one knows for sure right now, but whatever information emerges could also help shape the development of both the gubernatorial and presidential campaigns.",

    "body": "Florida Governor Ron DeSantis weighs in on the petition in support of the illegal alien trucker accused of killing three and California Governor Gavin Newsom's 'tough guy' act on 'Hannity.'\n\nAn illegal alien truck driver accused of causing a crash in Florida that killed three people appeared in court Thursday as his attorneys pressed for new testing of evidence before trial.\n\nHarjinder Singh, 28, of India, faces multiple felony counts for allegedly causing a fiery semi-truck crash that killed three people in Fort Pierce, Florida in August.\n\nSingh, who crossed into the United States illegally in 2018 via the southern border, has been charged with three counts of vehicular homicide and was extradited to Florida to face charges after traveling to California in the aftermath of the crash.\n\nHe appeared via video conference from jail for a docket call before Judge Lawrence Mirman in St. Lucie Courthouse in Florida on Thursday at 10:30 a.m.\n\nBODYCAM VIDEO SHOWS ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT TRUCK DRIVER SPEAKING LIMITED ENGLISH WITH NEW MEXICO OFFICER\n\nDefense attorneys requested that Singh's blood samples be released for independent analysis and asked for access to inspect the vehicles involved before they are released from law enforcement custody. Prosecutors did not object, and both sides told the court they expect those steps to be completed before the end of the year.\n\nThe defense also requested a continuance to allow more time to review discovery materials, which the judge granted. The next jury docket call is now scheduled for Jan. 15, 2026, with the case continuing toward trial.\n\nSingh's attorney told the court that his client is indigent but has received some third-party assistance to fund the defense. Mirman explained the process for requesting an indigency declaration \"for cost\" despite Singh retaining private counsel.\n\nThe defense asked that Singh be allowed to appear virtually for the next docket call, though Mirman said another judge will preside that day and will determine whether virtual appearances are permitted. Singh confirmed through an interpreter that he understood the proceedings.\n\nEXPERT REVEALS HOW ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT TRUCKER MAY HAVE GOTTEN COMMERCIAL LICENSE BEFORE FATAL FLORIDA CRASH\n\nFox News previously reported, citing a senior official with the Florida Attorney General's Office, that Singh failed his commercial driver's license (CDL) test 10 times in two months before finally receiving a license in 2023 in Washington state.\n\nInvestigators with the Florida AG's office learned Singh failed his CDL knowledge exam in Washington state 10 times between March 10, 2023, and May 5, 2023. They also learned he failed his air brakes knowledge exam twice.\n\nThe Washington company that trained Singh for his CDL attested that he could speak English, even though he struggled to speak it proficiently, the senior official said. Still, Washington issued Singh his first CDL, and California later granted him another.\n\nBodycam video released in August shows Singh struggling with limited English after being pulled over for speeding in New Mexico a month earlier, a detail that has become a major focal point in the case.\n\nThe footage shows Singh being stopped by a New Mexico State Police officer on July 3 for allegedly driving 60 mph in a 45 mph zone. Singh appeared apologetic as he received a ticket. He communicated clearly at first, but after signing paperwork and preparing to leave, the officer struggled to understand him.\n\nOfficials investigating the wreck in Florida said Singh failed English and road sign tests. He's accused of jackknifing his 18-wheeler during an illegal U-turn, causing a van to smash into the side of the semi, leaving three people dead.\n\nWATCH: Florida AG slams California over alleged illegal migrant trucker licenses after deadly crash\n\nTransportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Oct. 15 that many big rig drivers fail to meet English language requirements, a problem his department is now targeting.\n\n\"I put states on notice this summer: Enforce the Trump Administration's English language requirements or the checks stop coming,\" Duffy said. \"California is the only state in the nation that refuses to ensure big rig drivers can read our road signs and communicate with law enforcement. This is a fundamental safety issue that impacts you and your family on America's road.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe announcement followed the Trump administration's decision to withhold more than $40 million in federal highway safety funds from California for failing to enforce federal English proficiency standards for truckers.",

Gavin Newsom's (D-CA) former chief of staff was charged on Wednesday with allegedly plotting to steal $225,000 and give the money to a friend, according to the Justice Department.\n\nThe Department of Justice (DOJ) charged Dana Williamson in a 23-count federal indictment with conspiracy to commit bank and wire fraud, defrauding the United States, obstructing justice, filing false tax returns, and lying to authorities.\n\nShe allegedly took part in a scheme to launder money from a political campaign to another person's account for personal use.\n\nU.S. Attorney Eric Grant said in a statement, \"This is a crucial step in an ongoing political corruption investigation that began more than three years ago. As it always has, the U.S. Attorney's Office will continue to work tirelessly with our law enforcement partners to protect the people of California from political corruption.\"\n\nFox News Digital continued:\n\nCourt documents named Sean McCluskie as the co-conspirator who received those funds. At the time, he was chief of staff for someone listed as \"Public Official 1.\" McCluskie is the former chief of staff for former U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra.\n\nBecerra previously served as California attorney general before he was appointed to the health secretary position by former President Joe Biden.\n\nIn 2022, Williamson helped McCluskie by using her political consulting company to bill Becerra's campaign for services. The funds were sent to McCluskie's wife for work done for Williamson, which was never done as part of a \"no-show job.\"\n\nShe served as Newsom's chief until the end of 2024.\n\nA Newsom spokesperson said, \"Ms. Williamson no longer serves in this administration. While we are still learning details of the allegations, the governor expects all public servants to uphold the highest standards of integrity.\"\n\n\"At a time when the president is openly calling for his attorney general to investigate his political enemies, it is especially important to honor the American principle of being innocent until proven guilty in a court of law by a jury of one's peers,\" the statement continued.\n\n\"Disguising personal luxuries as business expenses -- especially to claim improper tax deductions or to willfully file fraudulent tax returns -- is a serious criminal offense with severe consequences,\" IRs Criminal Investigation Oakland Field Office Special Agent in Charge Linda Nguyen said.",

    "body": "'Outnumbered' reacts to California Gov. Gavin Newsom's criticisms of his own party for walking away from America's masculinity crisis.\n\nCalifornia Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom vowed this week that he would stop a reported Trump administration effort to unleash energy production off California's coast in a social media post that was widely criticized by conservatives and experts who spoke to Fox News Digital.\n\n\"Dead on arrival,\" Newsom said in a post on X on Tuesday in response to a Washington Post article reporting that Trump officials are mulling plans to propose oil drilling off California's coast \"for the first time in decades.\"\n\nNewsom's post, viewed over 3 million times, drew quick pushback from conservatives.\n\n\"Dead on arrival\" is what @GavinNewsom says about Trump proposal to drill offshore California,\" ophthalmologist and commentator Houman David Hemmati posted on X.\n\nFETTERMAN FIRES BACK AT NEWSOM AFTER SHUTDOWN CRITICISM, REFUSES TO 'PLAY CHICKEN' WITH THE LIVES OF AMERICANS\n\n\"The SAME man who's been pushing for overpriced, unreliable, environmentally catastrophic offshore wind.\"\n\nGabriella Hoffman, director of the Independent Women's Forum Center for Energy and Conservation, told Fox News Digital that new offshore oil and gas projects \"should be explored in California\" and that the projects are \"safe\" and \"have a minimal environmental footprint due to improved technology and increased safety measures.\"\n\n\"California is considered an oil island, despite having plentiful onshore and offshore recoverable oil reserves,\" Hoffman said. \"Governor Newsom purports to hate oil and gas, yet 60% of California's petroleum is imported from foreign nations including Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Brazil, and Guyana. That's unsettling, but a natural consequence of forcing a 100% transition to renewables.\"\n\nNewsom was the most prominent American official to attend the COP30 global climate conference in Belém, Brazil, this week -- using the platform to criticize the absent Trump administration.\n\nThe White House mocked the trip, noting California's continued rank among the highest in U.S. energy costs.\n\n3 REASONS CALIFORNIA'S GREEN ENERGY CAMPAIGN IS DYING ON THE VINE\n\nIn a statement to Fox News Digital, a spokesperson for Newsom's office said, \"The Trump administration has yet to formally share with us their plan, but expensive and riskier offshore drilling would put our communities at risk and undermine the economic stability of our coastal economies. Given recent history, we're not surprised by the lack of communication or their lack of thought into how their actions will impact Americans. The Trump administration's focus continues to be on the next grift, and not the well-being of our people and communities.\"\n\nNewsom's office put out a summary of his visit to the conference, saying it shows California is \"leading by example\" and proving that \"climate action and economic growth go hand in hand.\"\n\nHoffman told Fox News Digital that while every energy project has \"environmental trade-offs,\" Newsom's climate agenda has resulted in renewables getting \"a pass.\"\n\n\"Governor Newsom desires to litter my home state's coastline with offshore wind farms that are eyesores, produce expensive unreliable electricity, and threaten fish and marine mammals,\" Hoffman said. \"Once decommissioned, oil rigs are converted to sanctuaries under the 'rigs to reef' program to support marine life -- including endangered fish species -- with habitat. Former Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger wisely laid the groundwork for this conservation program in 2010 when he signed AB 2503 into law.\"\n\nMark Bednar, former communications director for Speaker Kevin McCarthy, told Fox News Digital that the Trump administration is focused on \"expanding America's energy dominance through further exploration\" and cautioned Newsom on being out of step with that.\n\n\"Right now, adversaries like Russia, China, Venezuela, and Iran are working around the clock to expand their economic and geopolitical footholds, and any American lawmaker who opposes moves to grow America's energy dominance will have a hard time explaining to the American people why unilaterally tying one arm behind our back is good for America,\" Bednar said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nUltimately, Newsom's climate policies, according to Hoffman, \"invited energy scarcity in the Golden State.\"\n\n\"California has the second-highest electricity rates after Hawaii. Californians also pay the highest gas tax rate of any U.S. state,\" Hoffman said. \"If two oil refineries close by 2026, California residents will soon pay $8 per gallon at the gas pump. That's unsustainable.\n\n\"California's energy crisis is entirely self-inflicted. New offshore oil and gas projects, along with new nuclear, geothermal, and natural gas, can reduce energy prices and make the Golden State energy independent once again.\"\n\nFox News Digital reached out to the Department of Interior for comment.",

    "title": "If Trump opens up California for offshore oil drilling, will any companies jump in?",
    "body": "By Rob Nikolewski | rob.nikolewski@sduniontribune.com | The San Diego Union-Tribune\n\nThe Trump administration reportedly wants to turbocharge offshore oil drilling in the U.S., including the coast of California. But it remains to be seen if any new rigs ever get built.\n\n\"Dead on arrival,\" Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a short post on X, responding to a Washington Post story that the administration will soon propose six offshore lease sales in California between 2027 and 2030.\n\nIf put into place, the move would mark the first new oil and gas leases in federal waters off the coast of California since 1984.\n\nThe draft map reportedly also includes expanding offshore drilling in Alaska and along the eastern portion of the Gulf of Mexico, renamed the Gulf of America by President Donald Trump via executive order earlier this year.\n\nOfficials at the U.S. Department of the Interior have not commented on the Washington Post story.\n\nOil and gas expert Ed Hirs, an energy fellow at the University of Houston, said the Trump administration could \"absolutely\" go forward with plans for new leases in federal waters, despite opposition from state officials.\n\nCalifornia has jurisdiction for the first three nautical miles from the shore. But the federal government has control beyond that distance.\n\nHirs was quick to point out that even if the administration goes forward, the crucial question is whether companies will be willing to move forward on making significant investments in building offshore facilities.\n\n\"Just because leasing is permitted doesn't mean somebody's going to actually pony up real money for it,\" Hirs said, citing expenses such as putting in new pipelines to bring the oil to shore, plus companies weighing whether it's simply more cost-effective to boost production at oil and gas facilities on land than building new platforms offshore.\n\n\"It really comes down to, can they drill a well and extract the oil profitably\" from new offshore facilities, Hirs said.\n\nIn addition, opposition from California policymakers would almost certainly create roadblocks for producers to access the permits needed to move any new projects forward.\n\n\"The Trump administration has yet to formally share with us their plan, but expensive and riskier offshore drilling would put our communities at risk and undermine the economic stability of our coastal economies,\" Newsom's deputy communications director Anthony Martinez said in an email.\n\nDavid Hackett, president of Stillwater Associates, a transportation energy consulting company in Irvine, said \"it seems unlikely\" that oil companies would jump into the California offshore prospects, given state government opposition and the fact that the price of domestic crude is currently below $60 per barrel.\n\n\"That's not enough money to go through all that,\" Hackett said.\n\nIn an email to the Union-Tribune, a spokesman for Chevron said the oil company had no comment until it sees an official announcement from the Trump administration.\n\nThe American Petroleum Institute, the trade group that counts more than 600 members in the oil and gas industry across the U.S., said, \"We will be happy to provide reaction once Interior publishes the plan and we have had a chance to review it.\"\n\nThere are 23 oil and gas production facilities in federal waters off the coast of California, according to the State Lands Commission, although some of them are no longer profitable to maintain. Twenty-two of those produce oil and gas, while the other is a processing facility.\n\nIn state waters, there are three offshore oil platforms -- one off of Santa Barbara County and two in the Huntington Beach area. Earlier this year, a facility called Platform Esther off Seal Beach was decommissioned by the Lands Commission.\n\nThere's also a set of artificial islands that produce oil, including the THUMS Islands in San Pedro Bay near Long Beach. The letters came from the names of the four oil companies at the time that formed the project decades ago -- Texaco, Humble, Union Oil, Mobil and Shell.\n\nAs per a November 2021 report from the California Energy Commission, offshore production from facilities in federal waters equated to just 1% of all crude oil processed in California refineries. Within state waters, the report said offshore facilities accounted for about 6% of total California production from 2011 through 2020.\n\nThe administration's reported road map for offshore drilling is part of a larger White House energy plan that includes boosting fossil fuels.\n\nAlmost immediately after Inauguration Day in January, Trump issued an executive order titled \"Unleashing American Energy,\" that highlighted multiple directives. One of them specifically mentioned \"exploration and production on federal lands and waters, including on the Outer Continental Shelf, in order to meet the needs of our citizens and solidify the United States as a global energy leader long into the future.\"\n\nConcerns about offshore oil facilities hit a peak in 1969 when a blowout at an offshore platform leaked 80,000 to 100,000 barrels of crude oil into the Santa Barbara Channel, killing about 3,500 sea birds and marine animals such as dolphins and sea lions.\n\nThe disaster provided the flashpoint to what many considered the start of the modern environmental movement in California.\n\nState policymakers have set aggressive climate and clean energy goals, including deriving 100% of California's electricity from carbon-free sources by 2045, if not sooner.\n\nBut there's anxiety that gasoline prices may rise across the state, amid a pair of pending oil refinery closures.\n\nIn 2025, Phillips 66 announced the shuttering of its twin Southern California facilities in Carson and Wilmington by the end of this year. A few months later, Valero said it will shut down its 145,000-barrel-per-day refinery in the Northern California city of Benicia by the end of April 2026.\n\nThe Valero and Phillips 66 facilities combine to account for about 18% of the state's crude oil capacity, leading fuel analysts to worry that the shutdowns will strain supplies of the specially blended gasoline that is sold to California drivers.\n\nAlready, some 63.5% of oil supplied to California refineries in 2024 came from foreign sources, led by Iraq, Brazil, Guyana and Ecuador, according to the California Energy Commission. The shuttering of the Valero and Phillips 66 facilities raises concerns that California will rely even more on overseas sources.\n\nAt the conclusion of this year's session of the California Legislature, Newsom signed Senate Bill 237 that included provisions aimed at increasing crude oil production in the state and eased permitting requirements in Kern County, the heart of California's Oil Patch.\n\nSB 237 also mandated that oil produced offshore must be transferred to refineries by pipelines that use \"the best available technology\" in order to protect public safety.",

    "title": "California revokes 17,000 commercial driver's licenses for immigrants - The Boston Globe",
    "body": "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Wednesday that California's action to revoke these licenses is an admission that the state acted improperly even though it previously defended its licensing standards. California launched its review of commercial driver's licenses it issued after Duffy raised concerns.\n\n\"After weeks of claiming they did nothing wrong, Gavin Newsom and California have been caught red-handed. Now that we've exposed their lies, 17,000 illegally issued trucking licenses are being revoked,\" Duffy said, referring to the state's governor. \"This is just the tip of iceberg. My team will continue to force California to prove they have removed every illegal immigrant from behind the wheel of semitrucks and school buses.\"\n\nNewsom's office said that every one of the drivers whose license is being revoked had valid work authorizations from the federal government. At first, his office declined to disclose the exact reason for revoking the licenses, saying only they violated state law. Later, his office revealed the state law it was referring to was one that requires the licenses expire on or before a person's legal status to be in the United State ends, as reported to the DMV.\n\nStill, Newsom's spokesperson Brandon Richards shot back at Duffy in a statement.\n\n\"Once again, the Sean 'Road Rules' Duffy fails to share the truth -- spreading easily disproven falsehoods in a sad and desperate attempt to please his dear leader,\" Richards said.\n\nFatal truck crashes in Texas and Alabama earlier this year also highlight questions about these licenses. A fiery California crash that killed three people last month involved a truck driver in the country illegally, only adding to the concerns.\n\nDuffy previously imposed new restrictions on which immigrants can qualify for commercial driver's licenses. He said earlier this fall that California and five other states had improperly issued commercial driver's licenses to noncitizens, but California is the only state Duffy has taken action against because it was the first one where an audit was completed. The reviews in the other states have been delayed by the government shutdown, but the Transportation Department is urging all of them to tighten their standards.\n\nDuffy revoked $40 million in federal funding because he said California isn't enforcing English language requirements for truckers, and he reiterated Wednesday that he will take another $160 million from the state over these improperly issued licenses if they don't invalidate every illegal license and address all the concerns. But revoking these licenses is part of the state's effort to comply.\n\nThe new rules for commercial driver's licenses that Duffy announced in September make getting them extremely hard for immigrants because only three specific classes of visa holders will be eligible. States will also have to verify an applicant's immigration status in a federal database. The licenses will be valid for up to one year unless the applicant's visa expires sooner.\n\nUnder the new rules, only 10,000 of the 200,000 noncitizens who have commercial licenses would qualify for them, which would only be available to drivers who have an H-2a, H-2b or E-2 visa. H-2a is for temporary agricultural workers while H-2b is for temporary nonagricultural workers, and E-2 is for people who make substantial investments in a US business. But the rules won't be enforced retroactively, so those 190,000 drivers will be allowed to keep their commercial licenses at least until they come up for renewal.\n\nThose new requirements were not in place at the time the 17,000 California licenses were issued. But those drivers were given notices that their licenses will expire in 60 days.\n\nDuffy said in September that investigators found that one quarter of the 145 licenses they reviewed in California shouldn't have been issued. He cited four California licenses that remained valid after the driver's work permit expired -- sometimes years after.",

But the arrest of Dana Williamson on federal public corruption charges sent a jolt through Sacramento and Newsom's orbit of close advisers. Williamson entered a not-guilty plea, including on charges of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and bank fraud.\n\nNewsom, who notched a major political victory on redistricting and has been basking in attention on the global stage, had been on an uncommonly good publicity streak in the run up to his likely 2028 presidential campaign. But news of the case against Williamson, who served as Newsom's adviser from 2022 until late 2024, forced the governor's camp to jump into damage-control mode.\n\nFirst, his office said he put Williamson on leave when he learned a year ago that she was under criminal investigation. (RELATED: Attorney for Newsom's ex-aide blasts arrest as 'grandstanding')\n\nHours later, his office had to contend with another development, when the attorney for Williamson, McGregor Scott, told Melanie Mason that Williamson was asked by the FBI last year to assist with an investigation into Newsom. She declined because \"she had no information to give them or offer them because she had not seen any misconduct by the governor of any kind,\" Scott said.\n\nNathan Barankin, Newsom's chief of staff, said the governor was not aware of any past or ongoing investigation by the feds: \"There is no basis for any federal investigation into the governor,\" Barankin said.\n\nNewsom's allies stressed that he is not mentioned in the indictment and that the alleged fraud scheme began before Williamson joined his office. And even one outspoken critic of the governor was skeptical the case would ultimately damage Newsom.\n\nSteven Maviglio, a veteran Democratic consultant and friend of Williamson's from their time working together in former Gov. Gray Davis' administration, said he was among the many Sacramento insiders shellshocked by the news.\n\nMaviglio, ordinarily a sharp critic of Newsom, said he's doubtful the case will affect the governor's political future: \"He's going to have one bad headline out of this, unless there's more to it, which there doesn't seem to be. He's had far more scandalous events in his career.\"\n\nRepublicans were quick to jump on the news, however ... arguing single-party rule in California has fueled political excess and grift.\n\n\"It's the chief of staff, it's not some random operative,\" former Fox News host Steve Hilton, a Republican gubernatorial candidate, told Playbook. \"You have a system that is like a corrupt, Tammany Hall regime.\"\n\nAs Blake and Lindsey Holden report, federal prosecutors accuse Williamson of helping funnel around $225,000 from a dormant campaign account apparently belonging to former Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra to Becerra's former chief of staff Sean McCluskie. McCluskie and longtime Sacramento lobbyist Greg Campbell entered plea agreements for their alleged role in the scheme.\n\nWilliamson is also facing allegations of lying to investigators and counting several personal purchases as tax-deductible business expenses, including a $15,000-plus Chanel handbag and ring, a $21,000 private jet trip and an $11,000 yacht rental, according to the indictment.\n\nReporters swarmed her as she left a federal courthouse in downtown Sacramento on Wednesday, but Williamson did not respond to questions as she got into a waiting car.\n\nGOOD MORNING.

In Brazil's Amazon region on the last leg of his climate journey.\n\nFIRST IN PLAYBOOK: BILLIONAIRES BITE BACK -- Longtime Newsom consultants have linked arms with as-of-yet unnamed \"business and tech leaders\" in an effort to tank a wealth tax initiative sponsored by SEIU-UHW, Playbook has learned.\n\nTheir newly formed committee, named \"Stop the Squeeze,\" will be run by veteran consultants Dan Newman and Brian Brokaw, both of whom have worked with Newsom on ballot measure campaigns over the years, along with Matt Rodriguez of Rodriguez Strategies.\n\nNewsom himself will not likely spearhead an opposition campaign, although he has stated his opposition to the measure. The governor previously called the labor-sponsored wealth tax, which aims to plug the state's health care budget shortfall by imposing a one-time, 5 percent excise tax on California's wealthiest residents, \"bad policy\" and \"another attempt to grab money for special purposes.\"\n\nBut even if Newsom is not directly involved, he may fear how tax measures approved under his leadership could haunt a potential presidential run. Should he choose to, he appears to have money left over in a Proposition 50 warchest to influence the 2026 ballot measure field. -- Will McCarthy\n\nFIRST IN PLAYBOOK: CARUSO CHATTER -- A poll in the field this week is testing Rick Caruso's strength in a potential gubernatorial contest, according to images of the survey viewed by Playbook.\n\nThe poll asks respondents who they'd prefer in a field featuring existing candidates as well as possible entrants including Caruso, Tom Steyer and Rep. Eric Swalwell. It goes on to prompt respondents with information about Caruso before asking whether that would make them more or less likely to vote for him.\n\nNegative info includes charges that Caruso \"has flip-flopped from being a Republican to a Democrat,\" is \"a billionaire who made his money as a real estate developer who helped create the state's affordable housing crisis,\" touted an endorsement from Elon Musk in the Los Angeles mayor's race and gave money to \"anti-abortion Republican candidates.\"\n\nPositive messaging casts him as \"a political outsider,\" a \"self-made successful businessman who is known as a problem solver who will work with officials of both parties,\" and as \"a common-sense Democrat\" aiming to take the state in a different direction than Newsom. The poll asks respondents before and after each round of messaging who they'd vote for if the primary were today.\n\nIt's unclear who commissioned the survey, but the focus on Caruso's candidacy suggests it was likely from Caruso's camp, his allies, or a competitor concerned about him entering the race. A spokesperson for Caruso, who has weighed running for governor or again for Los Angeles mayor, declined to comment.\n\nBREAKING NEWS: MCGUIRE'S IN -- Senate President Pro Tem Mike McGuire is officially launching his long-anticipated run for the new 1st Congressional District, telegraphing strength out of the gate with endorsements from Sen. Adam Schiff, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Reps. Mike Thompson and Jared Huffman, and every Democratic county supervisor in the district.\n\nWhile the terming-out Sonoma Democrat was long believed to be planning a run to succeed Thompson, Proposition 50 -- which McGuire adamantly supported, along with the rest of his Democratic colleagues -- created a new opportunity that would not require waiting on a Democratic incumbent, though Democrat Audrey Denney is also running in the 1st after unsuccessfully challenging Rep. Doug LaMalfa in past cycles.\n\nIn a press release announcing his run, McGuire touted his accomplishments on housing, wildfires and the environment while vowing to work to \"defend our democracy from Donald Trump.\" -- Jeremy B. White\n\nFIRST IN POLITICO: MORE THE MERRIER? -- Assemblymember Matt Haney has discussed running to succeed outgoing Rep. Nancy Pelosi in talks with labor leaders, according to two allies familiar with his discussions and granted anonymity to describe them. Haney suggested in those conversations that his entry into the race would hinge on whether he can consolidate the support of powerful labor unions, they said.\n\nHaney denied interest in the House seat and downplayed those conversations in a statement to POLITICO on Wednesday, as Dustin scooped for subscribers.\n\n\"I'm flattered that folks are throwing my name out for Congress, but I'm running for re-election to the state Assembly in 2026,\" he said. \"If the state Senate seat opens up in 2027 or 2028, I would seriously consider running for that, but until then my focus is on my work in the Assembly.\"\n\nPelosi, the former House speaker, announced last week that she will not run for another term in Congress next year, setting off a flurry of campaign maneuvering in this bastion of Democratic politics.\n\nChristine Pelosi, an attorney and longtime party organizer, announced this week that she will not run to succeed her mother and instead vie for a seat in the state Senate. Labor unions and liberal groups in the city are now scrambling to draft a candidate in a field where many argue there's not a clear progressive contender to replace the elder Pelosi.\n\nAlready running for the seat are Saikat Chakrabarti, a wealthy former tech executive and progressive organizer, and Scott Wiener, a prominent state senator. Other potential contenders include former San Francisco Mayor London Breed, a moderate Democrat who served during the city's post-pandemic recovery, and Supervisor Connie Chan, a progressive force inside City Hall aligned with labor unions.\n\nDIALING UP -- While the two represent different poles of the Democratic Party, San Francisco's moderate Mayor Daniel Lurie spoke to New York Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani the morning after his win.\n\n\"I said, 'Congratulations. Anything I can do to be helpful, great,'\" Lurie recounted at an AI conference Wednesday. \"I love New York. I want New York to succeed.\"\n\nLong before he became San Francisco's mayor, Lurie worked for the Robin Hood Foundation in New York and met his wife in the city.\n\nBut he also held back from offering Mamdani any words of wisdom over the phone, saying \"no one should be asking someone that's been in a job for 10 months for advice.\"\n\nLurie really did not want to revisit another call he had to give a political leader lately. He and tech executives like Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang took to the phones last month, convincing Trump not to deploy the National Guard into the city after Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff initially endorsed the idea.\n\nWhen that came up at the conference, Lurie not-so-jokingly asked for the next question twice.\n\n\"People that aren't living in San Francisco didn't see what we were seeing,\" he finally responded, a reference to how Benioff now primarily resides in Hawaii. \"What I've told everybody, including Marc and any other leader, I said, 'Walk with me.'\" -- Christine Mui\n\nMAKING FRIENDS, INFLUENCING PEOPLE -- Newsom is returning to a time-tested technique to exercise soft power at this week's U.N. climate talks: signing voluntary agreements, joint statements and other memorandums of understanding.\n\nHe's inked deals this week with Nigeria, the German state of Baden-Württemberg and the host Brazilian state of Pará, building on a tradition started by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and continued by Gov. Jerry Brown. There's just one glaring weakness: None of it is binding. Read last night's California Climate for more on who's been trying to get face time in Brazil and what might emerge from the pacts.\n\nSHUTDOWN RIPPLES -- State Sen. Jesse Arreguín and the California Senate Human Services Committee will hold a hearing at 1:30 p.m. today to discuss what impacts the government shutdown and H.R. 1 will have on the state's CalFresh benefits.\n\nBACK IN BUSINESS -- President Donald Trump signed legislation late Wednesday to end the government shutdown that spanned 43 days, punting the next funding deadline into late January. As Jennifer Scholtes reports, the House passed the funding measure earlier in the evening, after eight Senate Democrats broke with their party to advance the package Monday night. Rep. Adam Gray, from the Central Valley, was one of six House Democrats who broke with their party and voted for the bill.\n\nCASES PLUMMETTING -- A San Francisco Chronicle analysis of federal prosecution data found that, since Trump took office, \"federal officials have significantly dialed back an initiative that targeted some of San Francisco's most high-priority criminal offenders and fast-tracked the deportations of those convicted.\" Federal drug cases filed in the city dropped in turn.\n\n-- A Sausalito ballot measure is on track to win by a blowout and bring density to Marin County, where closely-spaced development is rare. (San Francisco Chronicle)\n\n-- Markos Kounalakis, a Hoover Institution visiting fellow and husband of the lieutenant governor, argues California should be admitted to the G7 as Trump backs away from powerful global organizations. (Washington Monthly)\n\n-- Chakrabarti, who's vying for Pelosi's House seat, argues Trump's gilded ballroom should be transformed into a museum on authoritarianism. (The Guardian)\n\nSPOTTED: VOTES FOR WOMEN -- Close the Gap, a group that helps elect female candidates, held its fundraising gala at the Julia Morgan Ballroom in downtown San Francisco last night. The group, which has focused on legislative races, announced its expanding its efforts to county supervisorial races in California.\n\nAmong those in the room ...

    "body": "A former chief of staff for California Gov. Gavin Newsom faces federal fraud charges in connection with diverting $225,000 in campaign funds\n\n* A former chief of staff for California Gov. Gavin Newsom has been indicted on 23 federal felony fraud charges in connection with missing campaign funds.\n\n* Dana Williamson is accused of helping divert $225,000 from a campaign account belonging to then - California Attorney General and former HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra.\n\n* Williamson has pleaded not guilty, while two alleged co-conspirators have reportedly pleaded guilty to related charges.\n\n* The indictment also alleges Williamson filed false tax returns and made false statements to the FBI.\n\nA former chief of staff for California Gov. Gavin Newsom was indicted on bank and wire fraud in connection with a scam to steal campaign money, according to federal prosecutors.\n\nDana Williamson, 53, of Carmichael, California, was arrested on Nov. 12 after a federal grand jury indicted her last week. She faces 23 felony charges that also include conspiracy to defraud the government, filing false tax returns, and making false statements to the FBI for allegedly diverting $225,000 from a dormant campaign account, prosecutors said.\n\nThe account belonged to former Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra, according to published reports by the Associated Press and the San Francisco Chronicle.\n\nWilliamson served as Newsom's chief of staff from 2023 through 2024. Williamson was also Becerra's campaign manager when Becerra ran for California attorney general in 2018.\n\nWilliamson pleaded not guilty to all charges during her first court appearance in Sacramento, California, on Nov. 12 as a judge ordered her released from custody, the Associated Press reported. Her attorney, Matthew Rowan, did not immediately return USA TODAY's request for comment.\n\nBecerra is a former 12-term Congressman and California attorney general who was appointed health secretary by former President Joe Biden. Becerra, currently a candidate for California governor in 2026, is not implicated in the indictment. Only known as Public Official 1 in court documents involving Williamson's indictment, Becerra confirmed his identity in a statement to multiple news outlets.\n\nBefore holding roles with Newsom and Beccera, Williamson held a cabinet role in former California Gov. Jerry Brown's administration before starting her own political consultancy firm.\n\nProsecutors allege Williamson, Sean McCluskie, Becerra's chief of staff at the time of the alleged misconduct, and Greg Campbell, a former prominent lobbyist, as well as two unnamed people, are accused of taking funds from Becerra's campaign account by using Williamson's political consulting company to bill the campaign under false pretenses.\n\nThe funds would then be sent to McCluskie's wife for work supposedly done for Williamson, according to an indictment unsealed on Nov. 12. The money, in the form of $10,000 monthly payments, was then funneled through various business entities and disguised as pay for a \"no-show job,\" from February 2022 to September 2024, FBI Sacramento Special Agent in Charge Sid Patel said in a news release.\n\n\"Today's charges are the result of three years of relentless investigative work, in partnership with IRS Criminal Investigation and the U.S. Attorney's Office,\" Patel said. \"The FBI will remain vigilant in its efforts to uncover fraud and corruption, ensuring our government systems are held to the highest standards.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Newsom's office said in an emailed statement to USA TODAY that the governor is not involved in the matter and that the governor's office put Williamson on leave as soon as she told them she was under criminal investigation.\n\n\"Ms. Williamson no longer serves in this administration,\" Newsom's spokesperson said in a statement. \"While we are still learning details of the allegations, the Governor expects all public servants to uphold the highest standards of integrity.\"\n\nBecerra, in a statement obtained by the AP, said he has voluntarily cooperated with the Justice Department's investigation.\n\n\"The news today of formal accusations of impropriety by a long-serving trusted advisor are a gut punch,\" Becerra told the news outlet. Becerra's campaign did not immediately return USA TODAY's request for comment.\n\nCampbell and McCluskie pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit bank fraud and wire fraud, and Campbell to an additional charge of conspiracy to defraud the U.S. government, court filings disclose, the San Francisco Chronicle reports.\n\nFormer Newsom aide indicted also charged with filing false tax returns\n\nThe grand jury indictment claims that Williamson filed false tax returns, claiming more than $1 million in deductions for her business from 2021 to 2023 that prosecutors said were for personal and nondeductible expenditures, including private jet travel, hotel stays, home furnishings and designer handbags.\n\nWhen questioned by FBI agents about diverting campaign funds and public corruption allegations, Williamson gave the authorities false statements, prosecutors said.\n\nWilliamson could face up to 20 years in prison if convicted, prosecutors said.",

    "body": "WASHINGTON -- Before flying to Brazil this week, showing up for the United States at an international summit skipped by the Trump administration, California Gov. Gavin Newsom made a stop in Texas. The redistricting fight that had started there had come to a halt in California thanks to the governor's action. \"Don't poke the bear,\" Newsom told an elated crowd of Democrats.\n\nIn Washington, a handful of Senate Democrats had just voted with Republicans to reopen the government, relenting on a fight for an extension of healthcare tax credits. Newsom lashed out harshly against his party colleagues. \"Pathetic,\" he wrote online, later telling The Times, \"you don't start something unless you're going to finish.\"\n\nThey were just Newsom's latest moves in an aggressive strategy to shore up early support for an expected run for president starting next year, after the 2026 midterm elections, when both parties will face competitive primaries without an incumbent seeking reelection for the first time since 2016.\n\nThe opportunity to redefine a party in transition and win its presidential nomination has, in recent cycles, led to historically large primary fields for both Democrats and Republicans, often featuring over 20 candidates at the start of a modern race.\n\nAnd yet, one year out, Newsom appears to be running alone and out front in an open field, with expected competitors taking few steps to blunt his momentum, ceding ground in public media and with private donors to the emerging front-runner.\n\nFormer Vice President Kamala Harris remains well-respected among Democratic voters and is said to be flirting with another campaign. Other candidates, including Govs. Wes Moore of Maryland, JB Pritzker of Illinois, Andy Beshear of Kentucky, Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania and Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, Sens. Ruben Gallego of Arizona and Chris Murphy of Connecticut, New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, are all said to be considering bids.\n\nBut Newsom has begun pulling away from the pack in public polling, emerging as the Democrats' leading choice and running competitively against top Republican contenders.\n\n\"It's very early, but at the moment Gov. Newsom seems to have his finger more acutely on the pulse of Democratic voters than his 2028 rivals,\" said Sawyer Hackett, a Democratic strategist and content creator who worked on presidential campaigns for Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.\n\n\"As a governor, Newsom has an advantageous perch to fight back and command attention,\" Hackett said, \"but he's getting a significant head start in defining himself politically -- as the guy who can take on Trump. And the battle for attention will only get harder as more contenders enter the ring.\"\n\nOver the summer, Newsom embraced a social media strategy leaning into the vitalist, masculine culture that has captured the attention of young American men and helped drive them to President Trump's reelection campaign last year -- a strategy that Newsom has said will be key to Democratic hopes of recapturing the White House.\n\n\"We need to own up to the fact that we ceded that ground -- we walked away from this crisis of men and boys,\" Newsom told CNN in an interview this week. \"They were attracted to this notion of strength: strong and wrong, not weak and right.\"\n\nIn a series of interviews and podcasts with with conservative commentators, the governor announced his opposition to transgender athletes competing in girls' sports. He moved to limit access to California's Medicaid program for immigrants without legal status. And he directed a crackdown on homeless encampments across cities in California that had blighted the state's national image.\n\nThe moves were seen as an effort by Newsom to position himself as a centrist heading into the campaign, a posture that could benefit him in a general election. But it could also open the governor up to a robust challenge from the progressive left.\n\nIn 2014, as former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was laying the groundwork for her run for president, polling showed her as the overwhelming favorite to win the Democratic nomination -- and ahead of all competitors by 49 points in the crucial battleground state of New Hampshire. She would ultimately secure the nomination, but only after facing down a serious challenge from Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who beat her soundly in the Granite State.\n\n\"One of the biggest pitfalls is who else might get in,\" said Christian Grose, a professor of political science at USC and principal of Data Viewpoint, a data and polling firm. \"At this stage with such a wide-open race, he is the front-runner, but who runs and who does not will shape his chances.\"\n\nOcasio-Cortez could pose a similar challenge to an establishment candidate like Newsom, political analysts said. But her prospects in a Democratic primary and in a general election are different matters. In 2020, when Sanders once again appeared close to the nomination, other candidates cleared the field to help Joe Biden secure a victory and take on Trump.\n\n\"The shape of the field is still fuzzy,\" said Jack Pitney, a politics professor at Claremont McKenna College. \"AOC generates excitement, but no House member has gone directly to the White House since [James] Garfield in 1880.\"\n\nNewsom's yearlong head start has earned him practical advantages. The campaign for Proposition 50, Newsom's successful bid to redraw California's congressional map along partisan lines, drew a new set of donors to a governor whose experience up until now had been limited to statewide office. Assertive exposure on social and legacy media has enhanced his name recognition nationwide.\n\nHe will need both to compete against Harris, a fellow Californian who could be convinced to stay out of the race if she isn't confident she will win the primary, a source familiar with her thinking told The Times. Harris would enter the race with the benefit of widespread name identification and inherited donor rolls from her previous campaigns.\n\n\"This stage in the race for 2028 we generally call the 'pre-primary' period, in which would-be candidates compete for three resources: media attention, money, and staff. Newsom is definitely ahead in the \"media pre-primary\" at this point,\" said Todd Belt, professor and director of the political management master's program at George Washington University.\n\n\"A candidate definitely wants to be seen as the front-runner early on in order to attract the best staff,\" Belt said. \"It's also good to get donors committed early on so they don't contribute to others in the race, and you can then go back to them for more donations and bundling.\"\n\nBut in a media environment where voters have increasingly short attention spans, Newsom could risk flaming out early or peaking too soon, analysts said.\n\nOther centrist candidates could emerge with less baggage, such as Gallego, a young Latino lawmaker and Marine combat veteran from a working-class background.\n\n\"If Democrats care about winning the general election, Ruben Gallego is one to watch,\" Pitney added. \"He could appeal to groups with which Democrats have struggled lately. Newsom does not exactly give off blue-collar vibes.\"\n\nGrose, of USC, also said that Newsom's association with coastal California could pose significant political challenges to the governor.\n\n\"There are pitfalls,\" Grose said. \"He needs to sell California, so any perceptions of the state's problems don't drag him down.\"",

    "body": "'The Five' co-hosts break down California Gov. Gavin Newsom's U.N. climate conference appearance -- and compare it to former Vice President Kamala Harris' book tour.\n\nAn annual United Nations climate summit being held in the Amazonian city of Belém in Brazil is slated to include talks and appearances by California Gov. Gavin Newsom.\n\nHowever, California Republican gubernatorial candidate and former Fox News host Steve Hilton, a longtime critic of Newsom, is putting the summit on notice if they allow him to speak.\n\nThis week, Hilton sent a letter to the heads of the COP30 summit, requesting that they deny anymore speaking roles for the California governor or face risking the credibility of the conference, citing the Democratic Party Governor's \"climate hypocrisy.\" According to Hilton, California, under Newsom's leadership, has imported nearly half of all the c.rude oil drilled from the Amazon rainforest\n\n\"Governor Newsom has built his political image around climate virtue signaling while presiding over one of the most environmentally destructive hypocrisies in the world,\" Hilton wrote. \"This oil comes from one of the most sensitive ecosystems on Earth, contributing to deforestation and the displacement of Indigenous communities ... Instead of addressing this exploitation, Governor Newsom continues to promote himself as a global climate leader -- jetting to international conferences to pose for cameras while his policies bankroll rainforest destruction.\"\n\nBILL GATES DISCOVERS THE WAY TO FIGHT CLIMATE BATTLE ACTUALLY INVOLVES HELPING HUMANS\n\nHilton notes that earlier this year, even members of California's Democratic-controlled state Senate unanimously called for an investigation into the state's role in funding the Amazonian oil trade. Oil drilling in the Amazon is rapidly increasing deforestation and destroying the rainforest's biodiversity, according to environmentalists, who argue California's reputation as a climate leader is undermined by its actions drilling oil in the South American rainforest.\n\nHilton, meanwhile, described Newsom's appearance at the summit as \"political theater masquerading as leadership.\"\n\nCALIFORNIA USING BACK DOOR TO GET FEDERAL FUNDS FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT HEALTHCARE, GOP SAYS; DEMS SAY NONSENSE\n\n\"To have Gavin Newsom lecture the world on climate justice while his administration promotes the decimation of the Amazon would be an insult to the conference and its members,\" Hilton wrote to the COP30 leaders. \"The UNFCCC and COP 30 must not reward hypocrisy with a platform.\"\n\nNewsom spoke Tuesday at the conference, during which he slammed Donald Trump for his failure to protect the environment, calling him an \"invasive species\" and \"a wrecking ball\" when it comes to progress on climate change. Newsom is expected to make appearances across the roughly two-week period that the summit is being held, including a trip deep into the Amazon Rainforest to meet with local residents and leaders.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nFox News Digital reached out to Newsom's office in response to Hilton's petition calling on COP30 to deny the California governor public appearances at the summit, but only received a six-word response.\n\n\"I'm sorry - who is Steve Hilton?\" questioned Newsom spokeswoman Izzy Gardon.",

    "body": "With help from Alex Nieves, Noah Baustin, Annie Snider, Timothy Cama and Corbin Hiar\n\nMAKING FRIENDS: Gov. Gavin Newsom may be a climate president in waiting, but as a governor, he has one glaring weakness: He can't sign treaties with other countries.\n\nNewsom is returning to a time-tested technique to exercise soft power at COP 30 this week: signing voluntary agreements, joint statements and other pointedly non-binding memorandums of understanding.\n\nNewsom and his administration inked new pacts with a bevy of governments both national and local, including Nigeria, the German state of Baden-Württemberg and the host Brazilian state of Pará. They join a long roster of agreements stretching back decades, including a program former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger set up to promote collaboration on forests and climate with governors from places like Mexico, Côte d'Ivoire and Indonesia and former Gov. Jerry Brown's Under 2 Coalition, launched with Baden-Württemberg, to promote subnational climate action.\n\n\"It's a part of a building,\" Newsom told POLITICO while in Brazil. \"It's about continuity. It's about calling cards. It's about relationships.\"\n\nThere are limits to the pacts that draw sniffs from some longtime climate diplomacy observers. Many of them focus on research, but California's public universities, under pressure from Trump, haven't necessarily rushed to defend international researchers. They also often mention trade, but nothing has emerged in terms of deals circumventing Trump's tariffs.\n\nBut the agreements represent some of the only leverage California really has in the international arena. Brown sometimes required MOUs as a condition of meeting with the foreign officials clamoring for his time.\n\nAnd Newsom likes them: He's been a driving force behind an increase in bilateral pacts, aides said, this year alone with Denmark, Kenya and individual states in Brazil and Mexico. When he looked earlier this year at a map of agreements California had signed, he remarked on the number of jurisdictions that weren't colored in, one said.\n\nWhile in Brazil, he fielded on-the-fly pitches from business and NGO leaders for agreements on strengthening economic ties between Brazil and California and incorporating Indigenous perspectives into forest policy. \"Let's get it done,\" he told Natural Resources Secretary Wade Crowfoot on Tuesday before slipping into an at-capacity room to excoriate Trump and promise California as a \"stable and reliable partner\" through changing administrations.\n\nSome of the pacts do lead to policy and technical exchanges. California policy experts have hosted foreign counterparts or traveled abroad to influence policies such as the creation of new carbon markets; conversely, they've learned about wildfire fighting from places like Australia, and groundwater mapping from Denmark.\n\nSome serve as symbolic markers: In Monday's joint statement with Baden-Württemberg, the two states don't promise any particular result, but rather to \"encourage each other to be more ambitious.\" Perhaps the most substantive agreement Newsom's administration signed in Brazil was with Chile, whose environmental representatives he met in Belém on Wednesday. In the meeting, they talked about sharing data captured by methane-detecting satellites that California launched with the nonprofit Carbon Mapper and several universities and philanthropies.\n\n\"The utilization of that open data in Chile, with the resources that we're providing in the absence of federal resources, is just a tangible example of those opportunities to highlight, promote and partner,\" Newsom said in Brazil on Wednesday.\n\nNotably absent from his agenda during his fly-by visit of the climate talks: any new joint major announcements or agreements with the U.S.-based climate alliances he's formally chairing. Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham of New Mexico was in Belém too, but Newsom left Wednesday for a trip deeper in the Amazon without issuing any joint statements. -- CvK\n\nDid someone forward you this newsletter? Sign up here!\n\nREFINED: Newsom signaled in Brazil on Wednesday that state regulators are making progress on blunting the impact of the impending closure of two of the state's nine gasoline-producing oil refineries, including one key Northern California refinery that the administration has tried to keep open.\n\n\"We have a task force led by [California Energy Commissioner] Siva [Gunda] and a CEC team, and we're gonna have more to say on refineries, literally [in] a matter of weeks,\" Newsom told Camille. \"As it relates to Valero and Benicia, relates to what's happening globally, not just nationally, not just California, with refineries.\"\n\nAsked about the governor's comments on the Valero refinery, Gunda said in an interview his team has had \"lots of conversations with them on the future of the asset\" but that there was nothing more he could share publicly as \"we have been under an NDA.\"\n\nValero didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. -- NB\n\nSLAM THE BRAKES: California air regulators' attempt to revive pre-Trump vehicle emissions rules is on hold.\n\nThe California Air Resources Board on Friday removed an emergency item from the agency's Nov. 20 meeting to restore older standards as a stopgap response to Congress' June revocation of the state's nation-leading electric vehicle sales mandate and stricter rules for diesel truck engines.\n\nCARB spokesperson Lynda Lambert said in a statement that the delay was made to give staff more time to \"consider public comments and stakeholder input.\" The emergency rulemaking, which would revert the state to 2012 light-duty standards, has drawn opposition from the auto industry's main trade group, which argued in a public comment letter that it would create more confusion.\n\nCARB is trying to clarify that the state still has the authority to certify vehicles sold within its borders, an open question after the federal rollback.\n\nState officials argue they have the legal authority to revive regulations that previously received EPA approval. But the Trump administration has pushed back, writing in a September public comment letter that the state would have to apply for federal approval to bring back the weaker rules, which it also opposes. -- AN\n\nBIRD'S EYE: A trio of California congressional Republicans voted to axe a decades-old rooftop solar credit. They all had solar panels on their homes, and one confirmed using the credit himself, Timothy Cama and Corbin Hiar report for POLITICO's E&E News.\n\nE&E News examined the rooftops of 112 members of Congress and found that at least seven Republican lawmakers had rooftop panels.\n\nThat included Republican California Reps. Ken Calvert, Darrell Issa and Young Kim, the latter two of whom had solar panels on homes they once owned. Public records show Issa sold his property last year. Kim transferred hers to a family trust in 2024 that now operates it as a rental property.\n\nCalvert defended voting for President Donald Trump's megalaw, which ended the solar credit that he used about 15 years ago to offset the cost of putting two rows of panels on the roof of his Southern California house.\n\n\"It never was supposed to be permanent,\" Calvert said of the credits -- a line echoed by other Republicans who criticized renewable energy as unreliable and dependent on subsidies. Trump's HR 1 passed Congress with no Democratic votes and the support of all but five Republicans. -- TC, CH, NB\n\nVALENTINE'S DAY DEADLINE: After Western states blew through the Trump administration's Nov. 11 deadline for a top-line deal on the Colorado River, the next \"milestone\" will be mid-February, Utah's lead negotiator said Wednesday. That's the final deadline that the Trump administration set for the states this past summer, which Utah's Gene Shawcroft told reporters is when states will need to have the details of an agreement pinned down.\n\nShawcroft offered a more chipper take on Tuesday's lack of a deal: \"We did not miss a deadline,\" he said. \"We were able to have enough of a framework put together that the federal government agrees with us that that framework can be continued to be refined in order for us to have a deal by the middle of February.\"\n\nHe also said the \"natural flow\" concept that states had briefly hoped could be a breakthrough, is now off the table, although he said elements of it could yet make it into a final deal. -- AS\n\nEXPLORING ENDANGERMENT: Alex joined LAist's Airtalk alongside Ethan Elkind, director of the University of California, Berkeley's climate program at the Center for Law, Energy and the Environment, to discuss the Trump administration's attempt to stop the U.S. EPA from regulating greenhouse gases -- and how that could actually benefit California.

The move caps a two-decade career with the U.S. Department of Energy, where Galer most recently worked in the agency's Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations.\n\nBryan Boersma also stepped into a new role at the CEC, where he began work as an attorney in the advocacy and compliance unit.

    "body": "Dana Williamson, center, a former top aide to California Gov. Gavin Newsom, leaves federal court in Sacramento on Wednesday, (Sophie Austin/AP)\n\nFederal officials arrested a former chief of staff to California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Wednesday, charging her with conspiracy to commit bank and wire fraud, submitting false tax returns and making false statements, among other charges, according to court filings.\n\nThe 23-count indictment unsealed Wednesday alleges that Dana Williamson conspired from February 2022 through September 2024 with Sean McCluskie, a former chief of staff for then-U.S. Health Secretary Xavier Becerra, and other associates to divert $225,000 from a dormant campaign account to McCluskie's wife for what law enforcement officials described as a \"no-show job.\"\n\nWilliamson served as Newsom's chief of staff through much of that period, but the charges against her do not involve her work for Newsom. Becerra appears to have been a victim, according to the indictment.\n\nThe dormant campaign account appears to belong to Becerra, who is now running for governor of California. Becerra was not named in the court documents. But it appears he is the person identified as a \"Public Official 1,\" because McCluskie was working as Becerra's chief of staff at that time and had been his longtime employee, as described in the court filings.\n\nMcCluskie had been tasked by Becerra with ensuring that the funds in the dormant campaign account, which he had accumulated while serving in public office in California, were monitored by a third party while he was serving as a federal official, according to the indictment. Williamson is accused of conspiring with McCluskie \"to steal money from Public Official 1's dormant campaign accounts for McCluskie's own benefit.\"\n\nThe money was covertly funneled through companies controlled by Williamson and others \"to hide the money's origin and avoid detection,\" according to the indictment. It was disguised as pay to McCluskie's spouse for a no-show job and transferred into an account controlled by McCluskie, the indictment states.\n\nLaw enforcement officials allege that Williamson and McCluskie intentionally misrepresented and concealed facts from Becerra -- representing that the money from the dormant campaign accounts was being used for consulting services.\n\nWilliamson entered a not-guilty plea at a court hearing Wednesday. She did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday.\n\nMcCluskie signed a guilty plea for conspiracy to commit bank and wire fraud on Oct. 30, according to a copy of the plea agreement. He could not be reached for comment.\n\nBecerra said in a statement that \"the news today of formal accusations of impropriety by a long-serving trusted adviser are a gut punch.\"\n\n\"I have voluntarily cooperated with the U.S. Department of Justice in their investigation, and will continue to do so,\" Becerra said in the statement. \"As California's former Attorney General, I fully comprehend the importance of allowing this investigation and legal process to run its course through our justice system.\"\n\nA Newsom spokesperson noted in a statement that Williamson \"no longer serves in this administration.\"\n\n\"While we are still learning details of the allegations, the Governor expects all public servants to uphold the highest standards of integrity,\" the spokesperson said. \"At a time when the President is openly calling for his Attorney General to investigate his political enemies, it is especially important to honor the American principle of being innocent until proven guilty in a court of law by a jury of one's peers.\"",

    "title": "California revokes 17k commercial licenses given to migrants  --  but...",
    "body": "California plans to revoke 17,000 commercial driver's licenses given to immigrants after the Trump administration raised concerns about people in the country illegally improperly receiving licenses to drive a semitruck or a bus. But Gov. Gavin Newsom said that isn't the reason.\n\nNewsom said the revocations are for violations of state law, but he didn't provide specifics.\n\nBoth the Democratic governor's office and the Republican Trump Administration's Transportation Department agreed that these licenses violated the existing standard that were in place before Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy recently tightened the rules following a nationwide commercial driver's license audit launched after a driver in the country illegally made a U-turn and caused a crash in Florida that killed three people.\n\nFatal truck crashes in Texas and Alabama earlier this year also highlight questions about these licenses. A fiery California crash involving an illegal immigrant truck driver last month that killed three more people only added to the concerns.\n\nCalifornia state transportation officials didn't immediately respond to questions seeking more details about why these licenses are being revoked.\n\nDuffy said Wednesday that California's action to revoke these licenses is an admission that the state had acted improperly even though the state had previously defended its licensing standards. California launched its review of commercial driver's licenses the state had issued after Duffy raised concerns.\n\nDuffy previously imposed new restrictions on which immigrants can qualify for one of these commercial driver's licenses. He said earlier this fall that California and five other states had improperly issued commercial driver's licenses to noncitizens, but California is the only state Duffy has taken action against because it was the first one where an audit was completed. The reviews in the other states have been delayed by the government shutdown, but the Transportation Department is urging all of them to tighten up their standards.\n\nDuffy revoked $40 million in federal funding because he said California isn't enforcing English language requirements for truckers, and he reiterated Wednesday that he will take another $160 million from the state over these improperly issued licenses if they don't invalidate every illegal license and address all the concerns. But revoking these licenses is part of the state's effort to comply.\n\n''After weeks of claiming they did nothing wrong, Gavin Newsom and California have been caught red-handed. Now that we've exposed their lies, 17,000 illegally issued trucking licenses are being revoked,\" Duffy said. \"This is just the tip of iceberg. My team will continue to force California to prove they have removed every illegal immigrant from behind the wheel of semitrucks and school buses.\"\n\nNewsom's office said that every one of the drivers whose licenses are being revoked had valid work authorizations from the federal government.\n\n\"Once again, the Sean 'Road Rules' Duffy fails to share the truth -- spreading easily disproven falsehoods in a sad and desperate attempt to please his dear leader,\" Newsom's spokesman Brandon Richards said.\n\nThe new rules for commercial driver's licenses that Duffy announced in September make getting commercial driver's licenses extremely hard for immigrants because only three specific classes of visa holders will be eligible. States will also have to verify an applicant's immigration status in a federal database. These licenses will be valid for up to one year unless the applicant's visa expires sooner than that.\n\nUnder the new rules, only 10,000 of the 200,000 noncitizens who have commercial licenses would qualify for them, which would only be available to drivers who have an H-2a, H-2b or E-2 visa. H-2a is for temporary agricultural workers while H-2B is for temporary nonagricultural workers, and E-2 is for people who make substantial investments in a U.S. business. But the rules won't be enforced retroactively, so those 190,000 drivers will be allowed to keep their commercial licenses at least until they come up for renewal.\n\nThose new requirements were not in place at the time these 17,000 licenses were issued. But these drivers were given notices that their licenses will expire in 60 days.\n\nDuffy said in September that investigators found that one quarter of the 145 licenses they reviewed in California shouldn't have been issued. He cited four California licenses that remained valid after the driver's work permit expired -- sometimes years after.\n\nNewsom's office said the state followed guidance it received from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security about issuing these licenses to noncitizens.",

    "body": "California Gov. Gavin Newsom's (D) former chief of staff was reportedly arrested and charged with having conspired to commit bank and wire fraud, among other things, as part of a \"political corruption investigation.\"\n\nIn a press release from the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of California, it was revealed that a federal grand jury charged Dana Williamson, 53, with \"conspiracy to commit bank and wire fraud, bank fraud, wire fraud, conspiracy to defraud the United States and obstruct justice, subscribing to false tax returns, and making false statements.\"\n\n\"This is a crucial step in an ongoing political corruption investigation that began more than three years ago,\" U.S. Attorney Eric Grant said in a statement. \"As it always has, the U.S. Attorney's Office will continue to work tirelessly with our law enforcement partners to protect the people of California from political corruption.\"\n\nPer the press release:\n\nPolitical consultant Dana Williamson, 53, of Carmichael, was charged by a federal grand jury with conspiracy to commit bank and wire fraud, bank fraud, wire fraud, conspiracy to defraud the United States and obstruct justice, subscribing to false tax returns, and making false statements, U.S. Attorney Eric Grant announced. The 23-count indictment was unsealed following Williamson's arrest this morning.\n\nCourt documents reportedly show that \"between February 2022 and September 2024, Williamson conspired with others to divert approximately $225,000 in funds from a dormant political campaign to an associate's person use,\" according to the press release.\n\nWilliamson, and the other people also reportedly \"funneled\" that money \"through various business entities and disguised it as pay for what was, in reality, a no-show job,\" according to the press release.\n\nWilliam also allegedly \"conspired with a business associate to create false, backdated contracts after receiving a civil subpoena in January 2024\" regarding Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans, according to the press release.\n\n\"Today's charges are the result of three years of relentless investigative work, in partnership with IRS Criminal Investigation and the U.S. Attorney's Office,\" Sid Patel, who serves as the Special Agent in Charge of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's (FBI) Sacramento Field Office explained. \"The FBI will remain vigilant in its efforts to uncover fraud and corruption, ensuring our government systems are held to the highest standards.\"\n\nIn a statement to Fox News, a spokesperson for the California governor clarified that Williamson, who was Newsom's \"chief of staff until late 2024,\" was \"no longer\" serving under Newsom's administration.\n\n\"Ms. Williamson no longer serves in this administration,\" the spokesperson told the outlet. \"While we are still learning details of the allegations, the governor expects all public servants to uphold the highest standards of integrity.\"",

A fiery California crash involving an illegal immigrant truck driver last month that killed three more people only added to the concerns.\n\nCalifornia state transportation officials didn't immediately respond to questions seeking more details about why these licenses are being revoked.\n\nDuffy said Wednesday that California's action to revoke these licenses is an admission that the state had acted improperly even though the state had previously defended its licensing standards. California launched its review of commercial driver's licenses the state had issued after Duffy raised concerns.\n\nDuffy previously imposed new restrictions on which immigrants can qualify for one of these commercial driver's licenses. He said earlier this fall that California and five other states had improperly issued commercial driver's licenses to noncitizens, but California is the only state Duffy has taken action against because it was the first one where an audit was completed. The reviews in the other states have been delayed by the government shutdown, but the Transportation Department is urging all of them to tighten up their standards.\n\nDuffy revoked $40 million in federal funding because he said California isn't enforcing English language requirements for truckers, and he reiterated Wednesday that he will take another $160 million from the state over these improperly issued licenses if they don't invalidate every illegal license and address all the concerns.

    "title": "Former Aide to Gavin Newsom Charged With Corruption",
    "body": "Laurel Rosenhall reported from Sacramento, and Shawn Hubler from Los Angeles.\n\nA former chief of staff to Gov. Gavin Newsom of California has been charged with conspiring to skim $225,000 from a dormant campaign fund that belonged to a top Biden administration official.\n\nThe former aide, Dana Williamson, 53, was charged by a federal grand jury with 23 counts, including conspiracy to commit bank and wire fraud, bank fraud, conspiracy to defraud the United States and obstruct justice, according to an indictment that was unsealed on Wednesday. She was also accused of illegally writing off $1 million in vacations, luxury purses and private jet travel as business expenses on her federal income tax returns.\n\nMs. Williamson pleaded not guilty during a brief hearing on Wednesday in Sacramento and was ordered to be released on a $500,000 bond.\n\nEric Grant, who was named the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of California in August, said the arrest stemmed from an ongoing political corruption investigation that began more than three years ago, when President Joseph R. Biden Jr. was in office. It involves a campaign fund that belonged to Xavier Becerra, a former California attorney general who served as the health and human services secretary under Mr. Biden.\n\nMs. Williamson is well known in California political circles as a fierce power broker with ties to top Democratic officials and deep experience on policy matters. She served in high-ranking positions for two governors, ran Mr. Becerra's 2018 campaign for attorney general, and was known at the State Capitol as an effective deal-maker who could bring peace among warring factions.\n\n\"Ms. Williamson no longer serves in this administration,\" Izzy Gardon, a spokesman for Governor Newsom, said on Wednesday. \"While we are still learning details of the allegations, the governor expects all public servants to uphold the highest standards of integrity.\"\n\n\"At a time when the president is openly calling for his attorney general to investigate his political enemies, it is especially important to honor the American principle of being innocent until proven guilty in a court of law by a jury of one's peers,\" Mr. Gardon added.\n\nThe campaign fund transfers, prosecutors said, enriched Sean McCluskie, the longtime chief of staff for Mr. Becerra, who was California attorney general from 2017 to 2021.\n\nFederal authorities accused Ms. Williamson of working with Mr. McCluskie and another political consultant based in Sacramento, Greg Campbell, to direct $225,000 from Mr. Becerra's campaign accounts to Mr. McCluskie from 2022 to 2024. The payments ultimately went to Mr. McCluskie's spouse for a \"no-show\" position, according to court documents.\n\nIn a plea agreement, Mr. McCluskie said that he had taken a pay cut when he went to Washington to work for Mr. Becerra at the Department of Health and Human Services, and that his salary was not covering his expenses, but that he was generally prohibited by government ethics rules from receiving outside income.\n\nIn early 2022, the plea agreement said, Mr. McCluskie met with Ms. Williamson, who was then in private practice, and agreed to a plan in which they would charge Mr. Becerra's dormant campaign account $7,500 per month as a fee for managing the money, and then funnel it through Ms. Williamson's consulting business and Mr. Campbell's public affairs firm to Mr. McCluskie's wife.\n\nLater that year, as Ms. Williamson was preparing to transition into a public sector job in the Newsom administration, she met with Mr. McCluskie and told him she could no longer continue their arrangement, but that she had found a new public affairs consultant to take over for her, the plea agreement said.\n\nMr. McCluskie agreed in October to plead guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud and wire fraud; Mr. Campbell agreed earlier this month to plead guilty to the same crime, as well as conspiracy to defraud the United States.\n\nThe indictment, which was first reported by The Sacramento Bee, describes Ms. Williamson and Mr. McCluskie as misleading Mr. Becerra about aspects of their plans to use his campaign funds. It also accuses Ms. Williamson of filing false tax returns claiming more than $1 million in business deductions for expenditures such as Fendi and Chanel handbags, home improvements including a new HVAC system, a luxury hotel stay for Ms. Williamson's birthday, and a $10,000 cash gift to a relative.\n\nMr. Becerra, who was not charged with any crimes and is running in the 2026 race for California governor, expressed dismay at the developments.\n\n\"The news today of formal accusations of impropriety by a long-serving trusted adviser are a gut punch,\" Mr. Becerra said about Mr. McCluskie, in a statement. \"I have voluntarily cooperated with the U.S. Department of Justice in their investigation, and will continue to do so. As California's former attorney general, I fully comprehend the importance of allowing this investigation and legal process to run its course through our justice system.\"\n\nMs. Williamson served for about two years in the Newsom administration before she left in November 2024. She previously served in the Democratic administrations of the former governors Jerry Brown and Gray Davis. A Newsom administration official, who did not want to be named because the official was not authorized to talk about the investigation, said that Ms. Williamson was placed on leave last year after she informed the office that she was interviewed by federal investigators and was under criminal investigation.\n\nMs. Williamson appeared in handcuffs in federal court in Sacramento on Wednesday afternoon, with glasses perched on her nose and her brown hair swept into a bun. She listened solemnly as Judge Carolyn Delaney read the charges against her, and as her lawyer entered a not-guilty plea on her behalf.\n\nMs. Williamson briefly turned around to look at the reporters sitting in the back of the courtroom. At one point, she raised her cuffed hand awkwardly to wipe a tear from her eye.\n\nShe faces up to 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine for each count of bank fraud, wire fraud, and conspiracy to commit bank and wire fraud. She faces less time for other counts, such as conspiracy to obstruct and making false statements.\n\nMatthew Rowan, Ms. Williamson's attorney, argued that she should not be held in jail before trial because she had no criminal history and was facing health problems.\n\nProsecutors said they had produced more than 27,000 pages of discovery and 752 gigabytes of iCloud data that would be part of their case. The next court date was set for Dec. 11.\n\nMr. Rowan declined to speak with reporters at the courtroom.",

    "title": "Ex-aide to California Gov. Gavin Newsom indicted for alleged theft of campaign funds from ex-health secretary",
    "body": "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- A former top aide to California Gov. Gavin Newsom has been indicted on federal charges alleging her involvement in a scheme to steal campaign money from former federal Health Secretary Xavier Becerra.\n\nDana Williamson was arrested and was scheduled to make her first court appearance Wednesday in Sacramento. It was not immediately clear if she had an attorney who could speak on her behalf.\n\nThe federal indictment lists four other co-conspirators. It alleges that Williamson was part of a scheme involving Sean McCluskie, who was Becerra's chief of staff at the time of the alleged conduct.\n\nBecerra is a former California attorney general who was appointed health secretary by former President Joe Biden. He is not implicated in the indictment.\n\nThe indictment alleges that Williamson and McCluskie set up a system to take money from Becerra's dormant campaign account and funneled it to McCluskie, about $225,000 over a period of more than two years.\n\nAccording to the indictment, Williamson began helping McCluskie in April 2022 by using her political consulting company to bill Becerra's campaign account for purported services. The money would then be sent to McCluskie's wife for work supposedly done for Williamson.\n\nWhen Williamson prepared to join Newsom's office in late 2022, she arranged for \"Co-Conspirator 2\" -- an unnamed former public official -- to take over her role in the scheme.\n\nWilliamson told the Los Angeles Times that year that she planned to sever financial ties to her company while working for the governor. However the indictment includes details of emails, calls, and meetings between her and McCluskie regarding the alleged scheme and cover-up while she was Newsom's chief of staff, a position she held until late 2024.\n\nWilliamson was also charged with falsifying business contracts related to Paycheck Protection Program loans her business received during the COVID-19 pandemic. She allegedly asked an associate to create a retroactive contract saying her company provided services to his company so she would be eligible for the loans and loan forgiveness.\n\nThe indictment accuses Williamson of filing fraudulent tax forms for her business from 2021 to 2023 claiming more than $1 million in business deductions for personal expenses, including luxury handbags and jewelry; private jet travel; vacations in Mexico; installation of a home HVAC system; and several hundred thousands of dollars paid to various relatives for fake jobs.\n\nMcCluskie signed a plea deal Oct. 30, according to court filings, agreeing to plead to one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud and wire fraud and to pay $225,000 in restitution to Becerra.\n\nIn a statement, a spokesperson for the governor said: \"Ms. Williamson no longer serves in this administration. While we are still learning details of the allegations, the Governor expects all public servants to uphold the highest standards of integrity.\"\n\nBecerra could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\nThe investigation began more than three years ago, FBI Sacramento Special Agent in Charge Sid Patel said in a statement. That means it started under the Biden administration.\n\nWilliamson faces 23 charges including conspiracy to commit bank and wire fraud, bank fraud, conspiracy to defraud the United States and obstruct justice, subscribing to false tax returns and making false statements, the U.S. Attorney's Office said.\n\nIf convicted she could face up to 20 years in prison.\n\nWilliamson is a longtime Democratic power player in Sacramento. She was a Cabinet secretary for former Gov. Jerry Brown before opening her own political affairs firm. She was also Becerra's campaign manager when he ran for attorney general in 2018, and she later rejoined state government as Newsom's chief of staff.",

    "body": "Breitbart editor-in-chief Alex Marlow shares his take on California Gov. Gavin Newsom's interview with TPUSA's Charlie Kirk on 'The Ingraham Angle.'\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom's former chief of staff was arrested Wednesday and charged with a number of fraud crimes for allegedly plotting to steal $225,000 and give it to a friend, the Justice Department said.\n\nDana Williamson, 53, was charged in a 23-count federal indictment charging her with conspiracy to commit bank and wire fraud, defrauding the United States, obstructing justice, filing false tax returns, and lying to authorities.\n\nWilliams allegedly participated in a scheme to funnel the money from a dormant political campaign to another person's account for their personal use.\n\nPOTENTIAL PELOSI SUCCESSOR RE-UPS BILL TO BAN ICE FROM OBSCURING IDENTITIES: 'SHUT THIS MASK S -- T DOWN'\n\n\"This is a crucial step in an ongoing political corruption investigation that began more than three years ago,\" US Attorney Eric Grant said in a statement. \"As it always has, the US Attorney's Office will continue to work tirelessly with our law enforcement partners to protect the people of California from political corruption.\"\n\nCourt documents named Sean McCluskie as the co-conspirator who received those funds. At the time, he was chief of staff for someone listed as \"Public Official 1.\" McCluskie was the former chief of staff for the former U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra.\n\nBecerra previously served as California attorney general before he was appointed to the health secretary position by former President Joe Biden.\n\nBeginning in April 2022, Williamson began helping McCluskie by using her political consulting company to bill Becerra's campaign for services. The funds were sent to McCluskie's wife for work done for Williamson, which was never performed as part of a \"no-show job,\" federal prosecutors said.\n\nWilliamson prepared to join Newsom's office in late 2022. As a result, she arranged for an unnamed former public official to take over her role in the scheme, authorities said.\n\nGAVIN NEWSOM TELLS DEMOCRATS THEY 'WALKED AWAY' FROM MASCULINITY CRISIS IMPACTING MEN AND BOYS\n\nWilliamson was Newsom's chief of staff until late 2024.\n\n\"Ms. Williamson no longer serves in this administration,\" a Newsom spokesperson told Fox News Digital. \"While we are still learning details of the allegations, the Governor expects all public servants to uphold the highest standards of integrity.\"\n\n\"At a time when the President is openly calling for his Attorney General to investigate his political enemies, it is especially important to honor the American principle of being innocent until proven guilty in a court of law by a jury of one's peers,\" the spokesperson added.\n\nThe investigation into the matter began during the Biden administration. The indictment doesn't mention Newsom.\n\nThe indictment also alleges that Williamson conspired with a business associate to create false, backdated contracts after receiving a civil subpoena in January 2024 from the U.S. Attorney's Office regarding Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans made to Williamson's business.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"Disguising personal luxuries as business expenses -- especially to claim improper tax deductions or to willfully file fraudulent tax returns is a serious criminal offense with severe consequences,\" said IRS Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI) Oakland Field Office Special Agent in Charge Linda Nguyen.",

    "body": "A new documentary about the Palisades Fire of January shows California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass (D) touring the Pacific Palisades as it burns behind them -- with a contingent of Los Angeles Fire Department firefighters accompanying them instead of fighting the blaze.\n\nThe film, \"Paradise Abandoned,\" scheduled for release in December, is a reminder that the Palisades Fire will continue to haunt Bass as she seeks reelection -- and Newsom as he seeks the presidency.\n\nNewsom addressed adoring crowds of Democrats in Houston over the weekend, even picking up a presidential endorsement or two, though he has not yet officially launched his campaign.\n\nHe is touting his success in passing Proposition 50 -- which gerrymanders California's congressional districts for Democrats' benefits -- as he casts himself as the leader of the party.\n\nBut victims of wildfires back home are openly threatening to tank Newsom's political prospects unless he makes amends.\n\nAnd any change may already be too late for residents who have been forced to sell their lots because of a lack of support from the state.\n\n\"Paradise Abandoned\" claims authorities diverted firefighting resources during the fire, which burned over 23,000 acres, destroyed nearly 7,000 structures and killed 12 people.\n\nIt notes that despite the fact that Pacific Palisades was situated in \"a region of maximum fire risk\" ahead of predicted extreme winds Jan. 7, not one additional fire truck was deployed to the area.\n\nResidents are shown having slipped past roadblocks on the second day of the still-burning fire to find out what happened to their homes.\n\nThey discover many have burned, with few firefighters in sight.\n\n\"The response is so f-king minimal,\" one says.\n\nMeanwhile, the film notes, many fire trucks were stationed on the outer perimeter of the fire -- or at a command post in a beach parking lot below the town, where they served as a backdrop for local officials to stage press conferences.\n\nOne resident recalls watching the Chase Bank building catch fire on the second day of the fire and burn completely through -- while the governor and mayor toured the area.\n\n\"The mayor and the governor were in the middle of town, doing a news conference. And in the background, you see the Chase Bank building burning to the ground. They weren't doing anything. The whole thing just burned right to the ground, with the mayor and the governor within a block of the place.\"\n\nNewsom and Bass are seen flanked by firefighters.\n\n\"They weren't doing anything,\" the resident says.\n\nAnother resident who lost his home reiterates his disappointment at the apparent lack of help from firefighters.\n\n\"You'd think they would have made some sort of effort to try to save this neighborhood, and others,\" he says. \"And they didn't come.\"\n\nHe said a neighbor who tried to alert firefighters on the beach saw them eating \"breakfast burritos,\" and was told they had been ordered to \"stand down.\"\n\nLocal firefighters have pushed back against such claims, explaining that they had to keep engines in reserve, given the lack of water, and that the wind -- which reached almost 100 mph atop nearby mountains overnight -- was simply too strong to have stopped the spread of the blaze.\n\nMany residents have also shared stories publicly of firefighters struggling valiantly to save their homes -- sometimes successfully, often in vain.\n\nStill, for some locals, who watched fire trucks drive by as their homes burned, a sense of trust has been shattered.\n\nAnd many continue to feel neglected by Newsom and Bass, as the politicians try to take credit for what they have called \"the fastest fire recovery in modern history.\"\n\nTrue, the federal government cleared the burned lots in record time -- but most still sit empty.\n\nMany residents blame the state for not forcing insurance companies to pay out and also blame local government for bureaucratic delays in approving rebuilding permits.\n\nThe LA City Council has not even voted to waive permitting fees for fire victims yet, despite months of promises by Mayor Bass.\n\nThe Post reported last month that Newsom \"nursed a bottle of tequila in his mansion while Los Angeles burned in the Palisades Fire -- and pouted that President Trump was blaming him for the devastating blaze.\"\n\n\"Paradise Abandoned\" leaves little room for doubt.\n\n\"The people in power made a decision: not incompetence, not an inevitability, but a conscious decision to give up,\" it declares.",

    "body": "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- A former top aide to California Gov. Gavin Newsom has been indicted on federal charges alleging her involvement in a scheme to steal campaign money from former federal Health Secretary Xavier Becerra.\n\nDana Williamson was arrested and was scheduled to make her first court appearance Wednesday in Sacramento. It was not immediately clear if she had an attorney who could speak on her behalf.\n\nThe federal indictment lists four other co-conspirators. It alleges that Williamson was part of a scheme involving Sean McCluskie, who was Becerra's chief of staff at the time of the alleged conduct.\n\nBecerra is a former California attorney general who was appointed health secretary by former President Joe Biden. He is not implicated in the indictment.\n\nThe indictment alleges that Williamson and McCluskie set up a system to take money from Becerra's dormant campaign account and funneled it to McCluskie, about $225,000 over a period of more than two years.\n\nAccording to the indictment, Williamson began helping McCluskie in April 2022 by using her political consulting company to bill Becerra's campaign account for purported services. The money would then be sent to McCluskie's wife for work supposedly done for Williamson.\n\nWhen Williamson prepared to join Newsom's office in late 2022, she arranged for \"Co-Conspirator 2\" - an unnamed former public official - to take over her role in the scheme.\n\nWilliamson was also charged with falsifying business contracts related to Paycheck Protection Program loans her business received during the COVID-19 pandemic. She allegedly asked an associate to create a retroactive contract saying her company provided services to his company so she would be eligible for the loans and loan forgiveness.\n\nThe indictment accuses Williamson of filing fraudulent tax forms for her business from 2021 to 2023 claiming more than $1 million in business deductions for personal expenses, including luxury handbags and jewelry; private jet travel; vacations in Mexico; installation of a home HVAC system; and several hundred thousands of dollars paid to various relatives for fake jobs.\n\nMcCluskie signed a plea deal Oct. 30, according to court filings, agreeing to plead to one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud and wire fraud and to pay $225,000 in restitution to Becerra.\n\nWilliamson was Newsom's chief of staff until late 2024.\n\nIn a statement, a spokesperson for the governor said: \"Ms. Williamson no longer serves in this administration. While we are still learning details of the allegations, the Governor expects all public servants to uphold the highest standards of integrity.\"\n\nBecerra could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\nThe investigation began more than three years ago, FBI Sacramento Special Agent in Charge Sid Patel said in a statement. That means it started under the Biden administration.\n\nWilliamson faces 23 charges including conspiracy to commit bank and wire fraud, bank fraud, conspiracy to defraud the United States and obstruct justice, subscribing to false tax returns and making false statements, the U.S. Attorney's Office said.\n\nIf convicted she could face up to 20 years in prison.\n\nWilliamson is a longtime Democratic power player in Sacramento. She was a Cabinet secretary for former Gov. Jerry Brown before opening her own political affairs firm. She was also Becerra's campaign manager when he ran for attorney general in 2018, and she later rejoined state government as Newsom's chief of staff.\n\n___\n\nDing reported from Los Angeles.

    "title": "California Revokes 17,000 Driver's Licenses. but the State Disputes It Is Over Immigration Concerns",
    "body": "California plans to revoke 17,000 commercial driver's licenses given to immigrants after the Trump administration raised concerns about people in the country illegally receiving licenses to drive a semitruck or a bus. But Gov. Gavin Newsom said that isn't the reason.\n\nNewsom said the revocations are for violations of state law, but he didn't provide specifics.\n\nThe Democratic governor's office said the unspecified violations were of state laws that were in place before the Republican Trump Administration recently tightened rules following a nationwide commercial driver's license audit launched after a driver in the country illegally made a U-turn and caused a crash in Florida that killed three people.\n\nFatal truck crashes in Texas and Alabama earlier this year also highlight questions about these licenses. A fiery California crash involving an illegal immigrant truck driver last month that killed three more people only added to the concerns.\n\nCalifornia state transportation officials didn't immediately respond to questions seeking more details about why these licenses are being revoked.\n\nU.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Wednesday that California's action to revoke these licenses is an admission that the state had acted improperly even though the state had previously defended its licensing standards.\n\nDuffy previously imposed new restrictions on which immigrants can qualify for one of these commercial driver's licenses. He said earlier this fall that California and five other states had improperly issued commercial driver's licenses to noncitizens, but California is the only state Duffy took action against. He revoked $40 million in federal funding because he said California isn't enforcing English language requirements for truckers, and he has promised to take away another $160 million from the state over these improperly issued licenses.\n\n''After weeks of claiming they did nothing wrong, Gavin Newsom and California have been caught red-handed. Now that we've exposed their lies, 17,000 illegally issued trucking licenses are being revoked,\" Duffy said. \"This is just the tip of iceberg. My team will continue to force California to prove they have removed every illegal immigrant from behind the wheel of semitrucks and school buses.\"\n\nNewsom's office said that every one of the drivers whose licenses are being revoked had valid work authorizations from the federal government.\n\n\"Once again, the Sean 'Road Rules' Duffy fails to share the truth -- spreading easily disproven falsehoods in a sad and desperate attempt to please his dear leader,\" Newsom's spokesman Brandon Richards said.\n\nThe new rules for commercial driver's licenses that Duffy announced in September make getting commercial driver's licenses extremely hard for immigrants because only three specific classes of visa holders will be eligible. States will also have to verify an applicant's immigration status in a federal database. These licenses will be valid for up to one year unless the applicant's visa expires sooner than that.\n\nUnder the new rules, only 10,000 of the 200,000 noncitizens who have commercial licenses would qualify for them, which would only be available to drivers who have an H-2a, H-2b or E-2 visa. H-2a is for temporary agricultural workers while H-2B is for temporary nonagricultural workers, and E-2 is for people who make substantial investments in a U.S. business. But the rules won't be enforced retroactively, so those 190,000 drivers will be allowed to keep their commercial licenses at least until they come up for renewal.\n\nNewsom's office said those new requirements were not in place at the time these 17,000 licenses were issued. But these drivers were given notices that their licenses will expire in 60 days.\n\nDuffy said in September that investigators found that one quarter of the 145 licenses they reviewed in California shouldn't have been issued. He cited four California licenses that remained valid after the driver's work permit expired -- sometimes years after.\n\nNewsom's office said the state followed guidance it received from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security about issuing these licenses to noncitizens.",

    "body": "Brandon Downs is a digital content producer at CBS Sacramento.\n\nDana Williamson, Gov. Gavin Newsom's former chief of staff, was arrested and charged with conspiracy to commit fraud and obstruct justice, federal prosecutors said Wednesday.\n\nCourt documents allege that Williamson, 53, conspired with others to divert about $225,000 in funds from a dormant political campaign to an associate's personal use, prosecutors said. That money, they charge, was then funneled through various business entities and disguised as pay for a \"no-show job,\" prosecutors allege.\n\n\"This is a crucial step in an ongoing political corruption investigation that began more than three years ago,\" U.S. Attorney Eric Grant said.\n\nFrom February 2022 to September 2024, federal prosecutors allege Williamson conspired with a business associate to create false and backdated contracts.\n\nThe indictment goes on to claim Williamson subscribed to false tax returns, claiming more than $1 million in business deductions that prosecutors said were for personal and nondeductible expenditures, like private jet travel, hotel stays, home furnishings and designer handbags.\n\nWilliamson went on to make false statements when questioned by FBI agents about the diversion of campaign funds and allegations of public corruption, prosecutors said.\n\nIt's currently not clear if she has an attorney who could speak on her behalf.\n\nWilliamson was Newsom's chief of staff from late 2022 through late 2024.\n\n\"Ms. Williamson no longer serves in this administration,\" Newsom's office said in a statement. \"While we are still learning details of the allegations, the Governor expects all public servants to uphold the highest standards of integrity.\"\n\nProsecutors are also unsealing charging documents for two other people charged by information in connection with the case, the U.S. Attorney's office stated.\n\nWilliamson was charged with conspiracy to commit bank and wire fraud, bank fraud, wire fraud, conspiracy to defraud the United States and obstruct justice, subscribing to false tax returns and making false statements, prosecutors said. If convicted, she faced a maximum statutory penalty of 20 years in prison.\n\nShe was a Cabinet secretary for former Gov. Jerry Brown before opening her own political affairs firm. Williamson was also Xavier Becerra's campaign manager when Becerra ran for attorney general in 2018.",

    "body": "DRIVING THE DAY: Dana Williamson, Gavin Newsom's former chief of staff, has been indicted on federal charges of conspiracy to commit bank fraud and wire fraud, according to court documents. A hearing is scheduled for 2 p.m. today at a federal courthouse in Sacramento.\n\nBACK TO BUSINESS: California House members are returning to Washington today with a bang, as Democrats released Jeffrey Epstein emails early this morning alleging that Donald Trump \"knew about the girls\" he was trafficking.\n\nHouse Oversight Committee Democrats, led by California Rep. Robert Garcia, put out the emails hours before Arizona Rep.-elect Adelita Grijalva is set to be sworn in and provide the final vote on a petition from Rep. Ro Khanna and Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky to compel a House vote pushing the Department of Justice to release its Epstein investigation files.\n\nTheir release allows Democrats to come back to the Capitol with some kind of victory, even as most prepare to vote against an agreement to end the federal government shutdown without an extension of Obamacare subsidies.\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson has kept the House out of session throughout the 42-day closure precisely to avoid having to deal with Epstein and other issues. He also put off swearing in Grijalva -- who has said she would provide the 218th vote needed for Khanna and Massie's petition -- after she won her special election more than a month ago.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said today that the Trump's administration is \"cooperating with and showing support for the House Oversight Committee,\" and that allegations about the president's involvement in Epstein's activities is \"truly a manufactured hoax by the Democrat Party.\"\n\nCNN today reported that Trump planned a White House meeting on the petition as he tries to peel off Republicans who've agreed to support it. Trump in a Truth Social post accused Democrats of \"trying to bring up the Jeffrey Epstein Hoax again because they'll do anything at all to deflect on how badly they've done on the Shutdown, and so many other subjects.\"\n\n\"Only a very bad, or stupid, Republican would fall into that trap,\" he wrote.\n\nThe California Democrats crowed about the Epstein developments, with Garcia telling reporters today \"the White House is involved in a massive cover-up and we want to know why won't they release the files\" and Khanna taking credit for securing the emails.\n\nThe \"ONLY reason\" they're public, Khanna said, is because MSNBC host Lawrence O'Donnell \"had the survivor's lawyers on who gave me the tip to subpoena the estate.\"\n\n\"Why did Justice or the FBI not get & release these?\" he wrote. \"Today, @MassieforKY & my petition get 218!\"\n\nKhanna told reporters today he's hoping to get a \"huge vote in the House,\" with \"40, 50 Republicans voting with us\" that could compel the Senate to pass the push for the release of Epstein documents.\n\nNewsom, in Brazil for international climate talks, also made social media hay out of the emails, saying, \"Color me shocked. Any comment, @JDVance?\"\n\nIT'S WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON. This is California Playbook PM, a POLITICO newsletter that serves as an afternoon temperature check on California politics and a look at what our policy reporters are watching. Got tips or suggestions? Shoot an email to [email protected].\n\nIN THE CLEAR? Harmeet Dhillon, Trump's assistant U.S. attorney general for civil rights, said no significant findings were reported by the election monitors that the Trump administration sent to California during last week's special election amid the state's high-profile redistricting campaign.\n\n\"In the counties we monitored, there were no major headlines out of that work,\" Dhillon told CNN's Elex Michaelson in an interview. She specified that they weren't looking for fraud, and that the goal of the election monitors was to ensure \"regularity and appropriate procedures.\"\n\nDhillon added that, \"we didn't see the same situation in California counties that we were monitoring\" as they did in areas of Pennsylvania and New Jersey.\n\nFollowing the Trump administration's decision to send monitors to California, Attorney General Rob Bonta announced that the state would be deploying its own observers to watch them, and accused Trump of trying to sow doubt and conspiracy theories about the fairness of California's vote on its redistricting measure. A spokesperson for Bonta said today that Dhillon's comments showed the deployment of monitors was \"a completely unnecessary diversion of resources\" amid the federal government shutdown.\n\nDhillon during the interview also said: \"I'm in litigation with the state of California over certain aspects of their election conduct, including unclean voter rolls and failure to maintain them, so there may have been some aspects like that,\" but added that she couldn't discuss findings. -- Juliann Ventura\n\nFIRST IN PLAYBOOK -- CALL OFF THE HOUNDS: Longtime Rep. Zoe Lofgren emphasized to Playbook today that she still plans to run for another term, likely to tamp down speculation that she may follow former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi into retirement.\n\n\"Now is not the time to give up,\" Lofgren said in a statement. \"Last month, I announced I'm running for re-election with the strong support of elected leaders and activists in my district.\"\n\nThe House member underscored her plans amid chatter that Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas may be eyeing her seat, should she retire -- a move that would spark a speakership battle among Democrats. -- with help from Dustin Gardiner\n\nFIRST IN PLAYBOOK -- THEY'RE WITH HER: Gubernatorial hopeful Katie Porter has snagged an endorsement from Fund Her, a group dedicated to electing progressive women.

    "body": "Gov. Gavin Newsom still insists he hasn't decided to run for president in 2028. But after persuading California's voters to gerrymander the state's congressional districts to grab more Democratic seats, he embarked on a flurry of appearances that had the distinct aroma of a political campaign.\n\nHe did an interview on CNN, jetted off to Texas to crow about California's passage of the Proposition 50 gerrymander at a rally of Democrats -- some chanted about a 2028 candidacy -- and then headed to Brazil as the self-appointed U.S. delegate to a climate change conference boycotted by President Donald Trump.\n\nOh yes, and Penguin Random House announced that in February, it will release Newsom's memoir of growing up in San Francisco, founding a business and segueing into politics, titled \"Young Man in a Hurry: A Memoir of Discovery.\" It will cost just $30.\n\nNo presidential campaign is complete without an autobiography describing how the candidate overcame barriers of birth and circumstance to become a dedicated public servant.\n\nAs Newsom surfaced in Brazil on Monday, Politico journalist Camille von Kaenel filed this analysis of the governor's purpose:\n\n\"The California governor's task at United Nations climate talks in Belém, Brazil, this week isn't to negotiate sweeping policy changes or break into closed-door talks reserved for nations. It's to put on a show: proving his state is still cutting emissions despite President Donald Trump's rollbacks, nudging governments and businesses to do the same, and reminding the world that the U.S. might one day pick the climate agenda back up -- perhaps under a President Newsom.\"\n\nThere is, however, a subtext to Newsom's claim to be a climate change warrior. In recent months, he's tiptoed away from the aggressive decarbonization programs he had championed earlier, clearly trying to minimize impacts -- particularly costs -- on consumers. Living costs loomed large in last year's presidential campaign.\n\nOne example is Newsom's effort to stop the planned decommission of the Diablo Canyon nuclear plant and several gas-fired generators in Southern California, when it became evident that taking them off-line could lead to shortages in electrical power and potential blackouts.\n\nAnother is this year's 180-degree flip on the petroleum industry. Newsom had spent months demonizing refiners for price-gouging, but when two refineries announced plans to shut down, raising the possibility of sharp gasoline price hikes, Newsom shifted to maintaining fuel supplies and encouraging oil production to stave off imports.\n\n\"We are all the beneficiaries of oil and gas. No one's naive about that,\" Newsom said. \"So it's always been about finding a just transition, a pragmatism in terms of that process.\"\n\nStill another example is what happened just a few days ago in Southern California. After years of squabbling over carbon emissions from ships and equipment at the twin ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, the logistics industry and the regional air quality board appointed by Newsom reached a compromise. The ports are a major source of emissions in the smog-sensitive region and the South Coast Air Quality Management District had been pressing them to shift from gasoline- and diesel-powered equipment to electricity. Cargo handlers complained that expensive retrofits could make the ports uncompetitive in global trade, potentially threatening thousands of jobs.\n\nThe agreement requires a three-phase, multi-year transition to zero-emission machinery, which disturbs environmental advocates and even some board members. Opponents who wanted immediate action chanted their displeasure and were removed from the meeting before the vote.\n\n\"The give-and-take of ideas and compromises in this process -- it mirrors exactly what a real-world transition to zero emissions looks like,\" said William Bartelson, an executive at the Pacific Maritime Association. \"It's practical, it's inclusive and it's grounded in shared goals.\"",

Gavin Newsom.\n\nAlthough the plan, first reported by The Washington Post on Tuesday, is years away from fruition, Newsom wasted no time shooting it down, calling it \"dead on arrival\" at the 30th annual Conference of Parties (COP30) climate summit in Belém, Brazil.\n\n\"It's never going to happen. Over our dead body. Dead on arrival. Period. Full stop,\" the Democratic governor and 2028 White House hopeful said about the proposal to sell six offshore leases along California's coast between 2027 and 2030. The plan also entails expanding drilling in the eastern Gulf of Mexico, which the Trump administration refers to as the Gulf of America.\n\n\"He's an invasive species. He's a wrecking-ball president,\" Newsom added. \"He's trying to roll back progress of the last century. He's trying to re-create the 19th century.\"\n\nNewsom has gone head to head with the president on a number of other issues since Trump took office this year, including his use of the military to act as civilian law enforcement in cities like Los Angeles and partisan redistricting efforts that favor Republicans.\n\nThe oil lease plan follows through on Trump's campaign promise to \"drill, baby, drill\" and increase domestic energy production, despite urgent warnings by scientists that burning fossil fuels, like oil and gas, will further heat the planet and exacerbate the climate crisis.",

    "body": "Two days after agitators violently disrupted a TPUSA event in Berkeley, California, the state's governor, Gavin Newsom, has yet to issue a public comment on the matter.\n\nThe incident unfolded on Monday night on the campus of UC Berkeley at a Turning Point event featuring actor Rob Schneider and author Frank Turek, a Christian mentor of the organization's late founder, Charlie Kirk. Left-wing agitators swarmed Zellerbach Hall where the event, which was the last stop on the \"This is the Turning Point\" tour, was held.\n\nFour students at the university were arrested, according to The Daily Californian, which omitted the suspects' names from its report. They were described as females between the ages of 20 and 22. Each was reportedly charged with felony vandalism.\n\nThe UC Berkeley Police Department confirmed that two other men were arrested during the night's activities.\n\nFETTERMAN FIRES BACK AT NEWSOM AFTER SHUTDOWN CRITICISM, REFUSES TO 'PLAY CHICKEN' WITH THE LIVES OF AMERICANS\n\nChristopher Joseph Benton, 48, who is unaffiliated with the school, was arrested for trespassing, resisting or obstructing an officer and being unlawfully present on campus, all misdemeanors.\n\nJay Eduardo Maytorena, 22, listed as a current or former student, was arrested for trespassing and resisting or obstructing an officer.\n\nSeveral of the skirmishes at the event went viral, including a man caught on video beating a Turning Point USA supporter who was arrested and charged with violent crimes.\n\nPolice said that upon further investigation, the second man involved in the fight was attempting to rob the victim of his necklace.\n\n\"After speaking with the involved parties and corroborating information through open-source media footage, officers determined that one of the men -- Jihad Dphrepaulezz (a 25-year-old Oakland man) had stolen the other man's chain from around his neck,\" police said. \"The other man was attempting to get his chain back from Dphrepaulezz.\"\n\nGAVIN NEWSOM TELLS DEMOCRATS THEY 'WALKED AWAY' FROM MASCULINITY CRISIS IMPACTING MEN AND BOYS\n\nNewsom, who is in Brazil attending the COP 30 climate conference, has not posted about the disruption of the event, which conservatives have labeled as an assault on free speech.\n\nFox News Digital reached out to Newsom's office for comment but did not immediately receive a response.\n\nNewsom famously sat down for an interview with Kirk before the conservative commentator was murdered, and the two briefly touched on free speech while discussing TikTok. Newsom raised concerns about teachers \"policing speech\" in classrooms.\n\n\"Grateful this level of attention being paid to what happened to our students last night at UC Berkeley,\" Turning Point USA's Andrew Kolvet posted on X.\n\n\"No one attending a peaceful event should be subjected to the type of harassment and attacks we saw last night. The Antifa thugs who did this MUST be stopped.\"\n\nThe Department of Justice announced it is investigating the campus chaos.\n\n\"Mob assault and thuggish intimidation of attendees exercising their First Amendment rights are unacceptable,\" Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon wrote in a post announcing the probe on X.\n\nCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe DOJ has demanded that the school preserve all records related to security and campus preparation for the Turning Point event.\n\nIn a lengthy statement provided to Fox News Digital, UC Berkeley strongly condemned all violence and threats that may chill freedom of speech. It also said it will cooperate with the federal investigation.\n\n\"The University is conducting a full investigation and intends to fully cooperate with and assist any federal investigations and the FBI-led Joint Terrorism Task Force to identify the outside agitators responsible for attempting to disrupt last night's TPUSA event,\" the statement said. \"UC Berkeley will take all appropriate steps to safeguard the right of every member of our community to speak and assemble freely.\"",

    "title": "Newsom adviser to nervous Dems: Lean in on immigration",
    "body": "LESSON FOR 2026 -- Juan Rodriguez knows the conventional wisdom that Democrats should steer clear of talking about immigration -- and he thinks it's dead wrong.\n\nThe longtime adviser to Gov. Gavin Newsom wants Democrats across the country to take heed of how the Proposition 50 campaign leaned hard into the issue and won.\n\nRodriguez oversaw paid media for the redistricting ballot measure, and under his watch, the campaign rolled out ads that prominently featured footage of President Donald Trump's militarized immigration raids.\n\nThe result: an emphatic win for the ballot measure and a notable swing left by Latino voters, whose drift rightward in 2024 has caused significant Democratic agita. He spoke to Playbook about why the party's immigration hawks inadvertently enabled Trump's deportation crackdown and how the idea that Democrats should emphasize the economy, not immigration, to win Latino voters is a \"false choice.\"\n\nThis conversation has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhat can you tell me now about how Prop 50 played with Latino voters?\n\nIt's clear from the outcome that we flipped the Latino vote in a way that has consequences, not just for this election that happened last Tuesday, but for what the potential [is] for the turnout to be heading into the midterms.\n\nHave you seen data showing not only that the Latinos who did vote voted yes, but that you were actually able to drive Latino voters to the polls?\n\nI would say we definitely saw reversion compared to 2024. You saw that across counties, and in particular, counties where that turnout was either depressed or/and had moved over to Trump. And not just with Latino voters. We also saw that with API voters.\n\nThis holds true for counties like San Bernardino, Imperial, Riverside -- areas where we had seen either increased Republican turnout or that reversion that we saw in 2024. Part of the overall Republican thesis heading into the midterms is that they were going to be able to maintain that coalition. And we're seeing evidence that that, in fact, is not true.\n\nYou leaned into messaging about immigration enforcement in your ads. Some analysts say Democrats rely too much on immigration as a way to appeal to Latino voters and that to get them back, the party should be laser-focused on the economy. It seems from the advertising in this campaign that you don't believe that theory.\n\nIt's a false choice, and false choices, unfortunately, have real world implications. The truth is, Latino voters expect their leaders to deliver not just on economic opportunities and messaging related to the economy, but also on safety, also on fairness, also on opportunities that create acceptance as Americans. And failure to do so -- we've seen time and time again how it ultimately leads to harsher, discriminatory immigration policies that alienate voters and miss out the opportunities for both trust and trust converting into turnout and engagement. Which is why as opposed to accepting that false choice, we ran through it.\n\nConventional wisdom holds that immigration is a weak issue for Democrats and the party is better off not talking about it. Given that immigration enforcement was such a big theme in your ads -- and not just the Spanish language ones -- and Prop 50 succeeded, do you think that should send a message to Democrats in 2026 about how to run on this issue?\n\nI don't think you can run away from this issue when you look around in cities across America, it is front and center in terms of what people are actually experiencing in their communities. I think accepting and amplifying that false choice related to avoiding the topic -- it does nothing to neutralize hard line critics. Republicans are going to continue to try to enforce eliminating due process.\n\nI think that the opposite is more likely true -- that if you don't do anything or if you don't talk about it, you're legitimizing, and perhaps may even be responsible for, the actions that this administration is allowed to get away with.\n\nBack in March, there was a lot of focus on Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a man living in Maryland illegally who was wrongly deported to a prison in El Salvador. Democrats were initially hesitant to talk about his case, and I know you were troubled by that. Was that on your mind when you were advising Newsom on how to approach these issues for Prop 50?\n\nBefore the Abrego Garcia case, you had the Laken Riley [Act] that ultimately got supported by some Democratic senators. Part of their argument was we needed to be stronger on the border. While that may be true to some degree, and we need to be talking about safety, the other thing the bill contained was a provision to eliminate due process, which I think was a precursor to this administration believing they could get away with harder immigration policies and the raids you saw across California.\n\nTo the point about Kilmar Abrego Garcia -- if you accept the premise that immigration is a subject we should just avoid, because Republicans have been successful in winning the hard line enforcement argument, and we give up terrain, we give up terrain on substantive policy that has real-world implications.\n\nDid these ads also resonate with white Democratic base voters?\n\nThey definitely did. There is real evidence in this election that we moved numbers in areas that have large numbers of Republicans and independents, and the independents being the key part of the story. That's going to be critical for flipping some of these seats heading into the midterms.\n\nSo you're saying with this messaging, you don't have to choose between appealing to Latinos and appealing to independent voters who aren't Latino?\n\nFor sure. And another way to drill down on the topic -- if families are living in fear of raids and separation, you can make the argument that they are also concerned about their ability to work, which also leads to their ability to invest in their communities. So immigration reform is also an economic issue, and it is also a public safety issue. It is important for us to be able to understand the differences and the nuance that is required on the topic, and not accept the premise that it is an unpopular issue for us, and therefore we should just avoid it.\n\nGOOD MORNING.

In Belém, Brazil, making more subnational friends.\n\nKEEPING YOUR OPTIONS OPEN -- Christine Pelosi's surprise foray into a California state Senate race has scrambled the field for the coveted legislative seat.\n\nFor months, the expectation in San Francisco was that Assemblymember Matt Haney would run for the state Senate if state Sen. Scott Wiener, who currently holds the seat, succeeds in his campaign to succeed Rep. Nancy Pelosi. Then, Supervisor Rafael Mandelman would run for Haney's open Assembly seat.\n\nBut the younger Pelosi, an attorney and longtime party organizer, announced this week that she would not run for the House seat long held by her mother.\n\nThat pivot has prompted speculation about whether Haney might vie for the House seats instead -- possibly stay in the Assembly, where he has gained clout and seniority.\n\nMandelman told Playbook that the cascade of political dominoes is forcing him to keep his options open. He said he \"cannot see\" running against Haney, though he would challenge Christine Pelosi.\n\n\"If, as seems somewhere between possible and likely, (Haney) runs for Senate, I will likely shift over to running for his Assembly seat,\" Mandelman said. \"If he does not run for Senate, I will.\"\n\nDOWN DONORS -- Rep. Ro Khanna said he lost donors after saying Sen. Chuck Schumer should be replaced as minority leader after eight of his members voted to advance a shutdown-ending deal devoid of the health care subsidy extension their party is seeking.\n\n\"I expressed what many people feel privately, but people are afraid to do that because of the donors that it offends: New York donors,\" Khanna said. \"I've lost some donors over it, but it obviously struck a nerve with all wings of our party.\"\n\nThat may not matter for Khanna, who is one of the strongest small-dollar fundraisers in the California delegation. And the call has paid off in earned media, as he has conducted interviews on Schumer with CNN and MeidasTouch and the shows of Don Lemon and Jack Cocchiarella, among others. His campaign also circulated a petition calling for Senate Democrats to replace Schumer.\n\nHe told Playbook his outpouring of public criticism was a long time coming. He pointed to Schumer's chamber backing away from a shutdown earlier this year, Schumer's foreign policy approach to Israel, and his decision not to endorse Zohran Mamdani in the New York mayor's race.\n\nBut would he encourage Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to primary Schumer? Khanna -- who, like Ocasio-Cortez, is viewed as a possible presidential candidate -- demurred. \"I think very highly of her, but it's up to her what she wants to do,\" he said.\n\nIn the California governor's race ... Khanna said he hasn't picked a favorite, but that he has talked with former Rep. Katie Porter as well as Tom Steyer, a possible entrant. \"I had a very productive conversation with Tom Steyer. I, of course, worked with Katie Porter on consumer protection issues, and I'm looking at who else may enter,\" he said.\n\nHis first priority, he said, is support for single-payer health care, noting it hasn't been implemented \"in the last eight years\" -- a pointed reference to Newsom's 2018 campaign promise that he would lead an effort to adopt such a system.\n\nNEWSOM GOES TO BRAZIL -- That sucking sound? It's a massive international vacuum on climate leadership -- and Newsom is filling it.\n\nNewsom is getting all the validation he could ask for as he mulls a 2028 presidential run, our Camille von Kaenel, on the ground with Newsom, writes from U.N. climate talks underway in Belém. He's taking the opportunity of a Trump-less COP to get in some digs (\"Trump is temporary,\" he said Tuesday) and bask in adulation as other Dems shy away from climate amid the political ascendancy of affordability.\n\n\"There's not a poll or a pundit that suggests that Democrats should be talking about this,\" Newsom told Camille in an interview. \"I'm not naive to that either, but I think it's the way we talk about it that's the bigger issue, and I think all of us, including myself, need to improve on that and that's what I aim to do.\"\n\nOn a tour Tuesday of a cultural center with Gov. Helder Barbalho, the leader of the Brazilian state hosting the talks, a passerby recognized them both. \"There's the governor,\" he exclaimed. \"And there's the California governor.\"\n\nLater in the day, as Newsom rode up an escalator packed with reporters and international officials on his way to deliver a speech, a bystander shouted: \"The escalator's not broken for you!\" -- a dig at President Donald Trump, who once had an escalator malfunction on him at the United Nations.\n\nNewsom grinned wide: \"Oh, I like that.\"\n\nCALIFORNIA TEA -- The Trump administration plans to open up the California coast to new oil and gas drilling for the first time in decades, The New York Times reports. Three people briefed on the matter told the Times that the Interior Department could announce the move as soon as this week, setting up a showdown with Newsom.\n\nAsked about the plan, Newsom rolled his eyes and said it would be \"dead on arrival in California\" and promised the state would sue.\n\nTHE YOUTH VOTE -- University of California students are pushing for another vote on their system's governing board after it passed tuition increases, CalMatters reports. Since the Legislature can't override UC policy due to the system's constitutionally-ingrained independence, students are considering pursuing a 2026 ballot measure to make the change.\n\n-- The U.S. Department of Justice is investigating UC Berkeley's handling of raucous protests surrounding a Turning Point USA event on Monday.

    "title": "Newsom Flies 5,000+ Miles to Lash Trump for 'Dumb' U.S. Climate Policy",
    "body": "California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) dedicated much of his Tuesday participation at the COP30 climate doomer summit lashing out at President Donald Trump over his \"dumb\" rejection of climate change alarmism.\n\nNewsom flew over 5,000 miles to Brazil earlier this week to participate in the ongoing U.N. climate change conference, hosted this year by the Brazilian government at the city of Belém.\n\nAccording to Reuters, Newsom asserted Trump's policies are a \"threat to rule of law and democracy.\"\n\nIn remarks to reporters, the California Governor justified his attendance at the event citing the \"absence of leadership from Donald Trump,\" accusing him of \"abdicating\" responsibility on climate.\n\nPolitico reported Newsom addressed an audience composed of local and international representatives, presenting himself as a \"counterweight\" to Trump's policies while touting the \"green\" policies that his administration has implemented in California -- which, he asserted, make it the \"most un-Trump state.\"\n\n\"He [Trump] wants to bring us back and try to recreate the 20th, maybe even try to recreate the 19th century,\" Newsom reportedly said. \"They're doubling down on stupid as it relates to climate policy in my country, but not in my state.\"\n\n\"The United States of America is as dumb as we want to be on this topic, but the state of California is not. And so we are going to assert ourselves, we're going to lean in, and we are going to compete in this space,\" he added at another point of his speech.\n\nThe governor further claimed that \"Donald Trump is temporary,\" and that \"California's commitment is strong, and we're in this for the long haul.\"\n\nNewsom declined to answer reporters on whether or not he is considering running for president in 2028, claiming he is more concerned about the upcoming 2026 mid-term elections. Newsom, however, reportedly expressed to be alarmed by the U.S. Democrat Senators that \"rolled over\" to end the government shutdown.\n\n\"I don't worry about 2028. I worry about fair and free elections. I'm more worried about 2026 and taking back the House of Representatives and getting the speakership,\" Newsom reportedly said.\n\nThe Brazilian outlet Metrópoles reported Newsom also availed himself of the opportunity to further scold Trump over the 50 percent tariffs imposed on Brazilian goods entering the U.S. Newsom nicknamed them as the \"Bolsonaro tariffs.\"\n\nPresident Trump cited the political persecution of former President Jair Bolsonaro as one of the reasons to impose tariffs on Brazil. Metrópoles pointed out that Newsom \"responded cautiously\" when asked on the possibility of meeting with Leftist President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva curing COP30.\n\n\"The tariffs against Brazil are a joke, an abomination. I mean, the 'Bolsonaro tariffs,' let's establish what they are, in fact. We want to negotiate the surplus with you. It's absurd. They are illegal tariffs. They are in the U.S. Supreme Court now,\" Newsom told his audience.",

    "title": "At Brazilian climate summit, Newsom positions California as a stand-in for the U.S.",
    "body": "BELÉM, Brazil -- The expansive halls of the Amazon's newly built climate summit hub echoed with the hum of air conditioners and the footsteps of delegates from around the world -- scientists, diplomats, Indigenous leaders and energy executives, all converging for two frenetic weeks of negotiations.\n\nThen Gov. Gavin Newsom rounded the corner, flanked by staff and security. They moved in tandem through the corridors on Tuesday as media swarmed and cellphone cameras rose into the air.\n\n\"Hero!\" one woman shouted. \"Stay safe -- we need you,\" another attendee said. Others didn't hide their confusion at who the man with slicked-back graying hair causing such a commotion was.\n\n\"I'm here because I don't want the United States of America to be a footnote at this conference,\" Newsom said when he reached a packed news conference on his first day at the United Nations climate policy summit known as COP30.\n\nIn less than a year, the United States has shifted from rallying nations on combating climate change to rejecting the science altogether under President Trump, whose brash governing style spawned in part from his reality-show roots.\n\nNewsom has engineered his own evolution when coping with Trump -- moving from sharp but reasoned criticism to name-calling and theatrical attacks on the president and his Republican allies. Newsom's approach adds fire to America's political spectacle -- part governance, part made-for-TV drama. But on climate, it's not all performance.\n\nCalifornia's carbon market and zero-emission mandates have given the state outsize influence at summits such as COP30, where its policies are seen as both durable and exportable. The state has invested billions in renewables, battery storage and electrifying buildings and vehicles and has cut greenhouse gas emissions by 21% since 2000 -- even as its economy grew 81%.\n\n\"Absolutely,\" he said when asked whether the state is in effect standing in for the United States at climate talks. \"And I think the world sees us in that light, as a stable partner, a historic partner ... in the absence of American leadership. And not just absence of leadership, the doubling down of stupid in terms of global leadership on clean energy.\"\n\nNewsom has honed a combative presence online -- trading barbs with Trump and leaning into satire, especially on social media, tactics that mirror the president's. Critics have argued that it's contributing to a lowering of the bar when it comes to political discourse, but Newsom said he doesn't see it that way.\n\n\"I'm trying to call that out,\" Newsom said, adding that in a normal political climate, leaders should model civility and respect. \"But right now, we have an invasive species -- in the vernacular of climate -- by the name of Donald Trump, and we got to call that out.\"\n\nAt home, Newsom recently scored a political win with Proposition 50, the ballot measure he championed to counter Trump's effort to redraw congressional maps in Republican-led states. On his way to Brazil, he celebrated the victory with a swing through Houston, where a rally featuring Texas Democrats looked more like a presidential campaign stop than a policy event -- one of several moments in recent months that have invited speculation about a White House run that he insists he hasn't launched.\n\nThose questions followed him to Brazil. It was the first topic posed from a cluster of Brazilian journalists in Sao Paulo, Brazil's largest city and financial hub, where Newsom had flown to speak Monday with climate investors in what he conceded sounded more like a campaign speech.\n\n\"I think it has to,\" said Newson, his talking points scribbled on yellow index cards still in his pocket from an earlier meeting. \"I think people have to understand what's going on, because otherwise you're wasting everyone's time.\"\n\nIn a low-lit luxury hotel adorned with Brazilian artwork and deep-seated chairs, Newsom showcased the well-practiced pivot of a politician avoiding questions about his future. His most direct answer about his presidential prospects came in a recent interview with \"CBS News Sunday Morning,\" on which Newsom was asked whether he would give serious thought after the 2026 midterm elections to a White House bid. Newsom responded: \"Yeah, I'd be lying otherwise.\"\n\nHe laughed when asked by The Times how often he has fielded questions about his plans in 2028 in recent days, and quickly deflected.\n\n\"It's not about me,\" he said before fishing a malaria pill out of his suit pocket and chasing it with borrowed coffee from a nearby carafe. \"It's about this moment and people's anxiety and concern about this moment.\"\n\nAnn Carlson, a UCLA environmental law professor, said Newsom's appearance in Brazil is symbolically important as the federal government targets Californa's decades-old authority to enforce its own environmental standards.\n\n\"California has continued to signal that it will play a leadership role,\" she said.\n\nThe Trump administration confirmed to The Times that no high-level federal representative will attend COP30.\n\n\"President Trump will not jeopardize our country's economic and national security to pursue vague climate goals that are killing other countries,\" White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said.\n\nFor his own part, Trump told world leaders at the United Nations in September that climate change is a \"hoax\" and \"the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world.\"\n\nSince Trump returned to office for a second term, he's canceled funding for major clean energy projects such as California's hydrogen hub and moved to revoke the state's long-held authority to set stricter vehicle emissions standards than those of the federal government. He's also withdrawn from the Paris climate agreement, a seminal treaty signed a decade ago in which world leaders established the goal of limiting global warming to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above preindustrial levels and preferably below 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit). That move is seen as pivotal in preventing the worst effects of climate change.\n\nLeaders from Chile and Colombia called Trump a liar for rejecting climate science, while Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva broadly warned that extremist forces are fabricating fake news and \"condemning future generations to life on a planet altered forever by global warming.\"\n\nTerry Tamminen, former California Environmental Protection Agency secretary under Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, contended that with the Trump administration's absence, Newsom's attendance at COP30 thrusts even more spotlight on the governor.\n\n\"If the governor of Delaware goes, it may not matter,\" Tamminen said. \"But if our governor goes, it does. It sends a message to the world that we're still in this.\"\n\nThe U.S. Climate Alliance, a bipartisan coalition of state leaders, said three governors from the United States attended COP30-related events in Brazil: Newsom, Wisconsin's Tony Evers and New Mexico's Michelle Lujan Grisham.\n\nDespite the warm reception Newsom has received in Belém, environmentalists in California have recently questioned his commitment.\n\nIn September, Newsom signed a package of bills that extended the state's signature cap-and-trade program through 2045. That program, rebranded as cap-and-invest, limits greenhouse gas emissions and raises billions of dollars for the state's climate priorities. But, at the same time, he also gave final approval to a bill that will allow oil and gas companies to drill as many as 2,000 new wells per year through 2036 in Kern County. Environmentalists called that backsliding; Newsom called it realism, given the impending refinery closures in the state that threaten to drive up gas prices.\n\n\"It's not an ideological exercise,\" he said. \"It's a very pragmatic one.\"\n\nLeah Stokes, a UC Santa Barbara political scientist, called his record \"pretty complex.\"\n\n\"In many ways, he is one of the leaders,\" she said. \"But some of the decisions that he's made, especially recently, don't move us in as good a direction on climate.\"\n\nNewsom is expected to return to the climate summit Wednesday before traveling deeper into the Amazon, where he plans to visit reforestation projects. The governor said he wanted to see firsthand the region often referred to as \"the lungs of the world.\"\n\n\"It's not just to admire the absorption of carbon from the rainforest,\" Newsom said. \"But to absorb a deeper spiritual connection to this issue that connects all of us. ... I think that really matters in a world that can use a little more of that.\"",

    "title": "Newsom Dubs Any Trump Plans For Offshore Drilling In California 'Dead On Arrival'",
    "body": "Reports suggest the Trump administration intends to sell new oil and gas leases off the state's coast.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom said a proposal for offshore drilling in the state would be \"dead on arrival\" as reports have emerged about the Trump administration selling new oil and gas leases in the region.\n\nAccording to The Washington Post, President Donald Trump's Interior Department is \"planning to open the California coast to oil drilling lease sales for the first time in decades.\" Under these plans, the Interior Department would conduct six lease sales between 2027 and 2030, a move that Newsom pledged to challenge in court.\n\n\"As it relates to offshore oil drilling, it's overwhelmingly opposed by members of all political parties in the state of California,\" Newsom told reporters while attending the COP30 Climate Summit in Brazil. \"It's dead on arrival.\"\n\nAn Interior Department spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThere haven't been new oil and gas leases granted off the state's coast since 1984, though past leases are still used for some oil production to this day, The Hill reports.\n\nCalifornia lawmakers have long opposed reopening the coast to more oil and gas drilling due to concerns about its environmental impacts. In 1969, a devastating oil spill near Santa Barbara polluted regional waters and beaches and killed thousands of birds.\n\nDecades after that disaster, California's legislature passed a law barring any new oil and gas leases in state waters. Former President Joe Biden also sought to restrict new drilling in federal waters off the Pacific coast at the end of his term.\n\nNewsom implied that Trump was aware of these concerns, since he's previously curtailed offshore drilling near Florida.\n\n\"He didn't promote it off the coast of Florida,\" Newsom told reporters. \"That says everything about Donald Trump.\"\n\nAt a prior event, Newsom also criticized the Trump administration for failing to attend the climate confab this week, and argued that it's relinquishing its responsibilities on the world stage.",

    "title": "Even the governors have entourages at COP",
    "body": "With help from Sara Schonhardt, Alex Nieves, Annie Snider, Noah Baustin, Mike Soraghan and Hannah Northey\n\nTHE GOVERNADORS: There are two governors seizing the spotlight at the United Nations climate talks in Belém this week: California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who's using his visit to draw a contrast with President Donald Trump, and the governor of the state of Pará, Helder Barbalho, who convinced Brazilian leaders to host the United Nations talks in his home city.\n\nAt the official COP conference hall, where the handful of national leaders who decided to stop by have already come and gone, Newsom and Barbalho stood out as the two people rolling with an entourage -- and a swarm of reporters. There were obvious parallels: two well-coiffed state governors on the left of the political spectrum, struggling to contain devastating wildfires in their forests.\n\nThe two sipped açai juice, walked along the river and looked at Indigenous art Tuesday at a cultural center on the shore of the Baía do Guajará, a confluence of rivers flowing out of the Amazon region.\n\nNewsom heard about the products his Brazilian counterpart is trying to sustainably produce out of the Amazon and toured the center's experimental starch- and juice-producing machinery. Then, the two signed a voluntary agreement focused on forest health and the prevention of wildfires, which have broken records in both states in recent years.\n\nThe two were trailed by two dozen Brazilian press, and POLITICO overheard Newsom joke to Barbalho: \"You're just more popular than I am.\" A passerby appeared to recognize Newsom, shouting, \"There's the governor. And the governor of California.\"\n\nBarbalho told reporters after the tour he wanted the agreement to bring Silicon Valley-style innovation to the Amazon. Newsom, for whom the tour was his first in Belém, said he was inspired: \"I couldn't be more enlivened and optimistic about the future here, and also the future of the rainforest,\" Newsom said.\n\nNewsom spent much of the day signing the same sort of agreements with other states and countries, including the German state of Baden-Württemberg, an ally since the days of former Gov. Jerry Brown, and Nigeria. He also took shots at Trump -- and batted away questions about Trump's plans to allow new oil drilling off the Pacific coast, as has been expected and as The New York Times reported Tuesday is imminent.\n\nNewsom called the proposal \"dead on arrival,\" saying members of all political parties in California oppose it.\n\n\"I also think it remarkable that he didn't promote it in his backyard at Mar-a-Lago, he didn't promote it off the coast of Florida,\" Newsom said during a press conference. \"That says everything about Donald Trump.\"\n\n\"We've talked in past COPs about the polluted heart of the climate crisis being big oil, increasingly the polluted heart of the climate crisis appears to be Donald Trump,\" Newsom added. -- CvK, SS\n\nDid someone forward you this newsletter? Sign up here!\n\nPIPELINE PIPELINE: California may not want offshore oil pipelines -- but it might be on the verge of getting its first-ever gasoline pipeline into the state.\n\nIt's just one of many pipelines that Trump's energy dominance agenda has spurred oil and gas companies to propose, reports Mike Soraghan for POLITICO's E&E News. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has more than 1,500 miles of new gas pipeline on its list of pending projects.\n\nPlans for pipelines will certainly see pushback from environmental groups. But Trump and the oil industry also face conservative challenges to pipeline companies' use of government power to seize property from unwilling sellers, an authority known as eminent domain.\n\nFarmers and property rights groups could slow or stop pipelines the energy industry says must be built for power-hungry data centers and massive export terminals along the Gulf Coast.\n\n\"I think a tsunami of pipelines is headed for landowners' property rights,\" said Rebekah Sale, executive director at the Property Rights and Pipeline Center, which works to end the use of eminent domain for the siting of oil and gas pipelines. \"I can only think that it's going to become more and more of an issue.\" -- MS, NB\n\nTHAT WHOOSHING SOUND: State negotiators blew through their Tuesday deadline to reach an initial agreement on sharing Colorado River water, but the Trump administration isn't following through on threats to write its own rules -- yet.\n\nThe Interior Department and seven Western states negotiating over the river's dwindling resources announced an extension to the Nov. 11 deadline, writing in a statement that the parties are still working towards a deal, POLITICO's Annie Snider reports.\n\n\"While more work needs to be done, collective progress has been made that warrants continued efforts to define and approve details for a finalized agreement,\" the statement read.\n\nThe Trump administration has previously said it would step into the yearslong negotiations to replace the water-sharing agreement that expires at the end of next year, though a rule crafted unilaterally by the federal government would almost certainly trigger a Supreme Court fight. -- AS, AN\n\nCOAL CLASH: The Trump administration's attempt to revive the American coal industry could hinge on a long-fought legal battle at the Port of Oakland.\n\nCoal miners from Utah to Wyoming have searched for decades for another West Coast port to ship excess supply overseas, but have watched plans for at least eight export terminals crumble in the face of financial hurdles, legal challenges, and uproar among residents and health advocates, Hannah Northey writes for POLITICO's E&E News.\n\nThey've honed in on Oakland, where a court case is playing out over whether city officials breached a contract with developers in 2016 by banning the transportation and storage of coal within city limits, after residents and environmental groups learned about plans to use a terminal to ship up to 10 million tons of coal abroad.\n\nAn industry victory would largely benefit coal producers in Utah and western Colorado that currently export through the ports of Long Beach, Stockton and Richmond. The latter is slated to stop handling coal in 2026 under a settlement reached with the city. -- HN, AN\n\n-- Trump's tariffs cut into Japanese automakers' combined earnings by nearly $10 billion between April and September.\n\n-- A California-based nuclear startup building its first reactor in Utah raised $130 million from backers like Lockheed Martin board members.\n\n-- A Bay Area tech company is setting up an LA-area hub for an all-electric aircraft air-taxi service ahead of the 2028 Olympics.\n\nCALIFORNIA POLICY IS ALWAYS CHANGING: Know your next move.

He said Republicans were ceding the fast-growth market to China, which \"will dominate in the next great global industry.\"\n\n\"The United States of America is as dumb as we want to be on this topic, but the state of California is not. And so we are going to assert ourselves, we're going to lean in, and we are going to compete in this space.\"\n\nA strident political foe of Trump, Newsom has for months been teasing a run for the White House in 2028.\n\nEscorted by UN police around the sprawling venue, Newsom was swarmed by conference attendees and cheered for representing the U.S. at COP. He declined to answer questions about a possible run for president, saying he was more concerned about the upcoming mid-term U.S. congressional elections.\n\n\"I don't worry about 2028. I worry about fair and free elections. I'm more worried about 2026 and taking back the House of Representatives and getting the speakership,\" he told reporters on the sidelines of COP30.\n\nHe said he was alarmed that eight of his fellow Democrats in the U.S. Senate \"rolled over\" to vote to support an end to the U.S. government shutdown. But he did not say whether he supported calls by some Democrats to replace Senator Chuck Schumer as the party's Senate leader.\n\nCALIFORNIA VS. WASHINGTON\n\nCalifornia is just one of 50 U.S. states, but its economy is the world's fourth-largest, making it a key player in influencing markets and energy policy.\n\nDressed casually in a white business shirt in the sweltering tropical heat, Newsom made a point of listing climate actions made by two Republican presidents from California, Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon.\n\nWhile Democrats have long made climate change a central part of their policy priorities, Newsom said the messaging needs to change so average citizens can connect with the issue on factors such as economics and cost, making them less vulnerable to climate skeptics like Trump.\n\n\"Climate change seems abstract. We need to talk in terms that people understand,\" Newsom said.\n\nItem 1 of 2 California Governor Gavin Newsom attends the UN Climate Change Conference (COP30), in Belem, Brazil, November 11, 2025.

Washington has conspicuously snubbed the COP30 summit.\n\nCalifornia, in contrast, has among the world's most ambitious climate change policies, including a goal to decarbonize its economy by 2045 and ban the sale of new gasoline-powered cars by 2035.\n\nNewsom said California's partnership on the issue was secure.\n\n\"But we can't do that without all of you ... So we're here with an open hand, not a closed fist.\"\n\nOn Monday, Newsom spoke with investors at a conference in the Brazilian financial hub of Sao Paulo, telling them the vacuum in U.S. climate leadership was \"jaw-dropping.\"\n\nNewsom has touted California's embrace of green tech, highlighting that the state has seven times more renewable energy jobs than fossil fuel jobs and reminding people that electric vehicle giant Tesla (TSLA.O), opens new tab was founded in California.\n\nHe blasted an expected Trump administration order to open up drilling in federal waters off the coast of California, calling it \"dead on arrival.\"\n\nSome diplomats worried that Trump's administration might try to disrupt the summit from afar.\n\nLast month, Newsom said he was mulling a presidential run in 2028. He has started to\n\nLast week, California voters backed his proposal to redraw the state's voting districts to offset redistricting in other states aimed at boosting the number of congressional seats held by Republicans.\n\nOn Tuesday, Newsom noted that Trump's tenure was set to end in January 2029, even as Trump occasionally teases that he wants to seek a third term.\n\n\"He's the most unpopular president in U.S. history. That's why he's trying to rig the election,\" Newsom told reporters.\n\n\"Trump is temporary. He's reckless. He's chaotic,\" Newsom added. \"People need to stand up.

    "body": "Gov. Gavin Newsom of California on Tuesday cast himself as the \"stable and reliable\" American partner to the world, called a reported White House proposal to open offshore drilling in the waters off California \"disgraceful\" and urged his fellow Democrats to recast climate change as a \"cost of living issue.\"\n\nMr. Newsom, a Democrat who is widely considered to be weighing a 2028 presidential bid, used his appearance at the United Nations climate summit in Belém, Brazil, to paint President Trump as a threat to American competitiveness by letting China dominate electric vehicles, solar panels and other clean energy technologies of the future.\n\n\"The United States of America better wake up at that,\" Mr. Newsom said at one of his many packed sessions at the climate conference, known as COP30. \"It's not about electric power. It's about economic power. We, as the state of California, are not going to cede that race to China.\"\n\nWhile the Trump administration opted not to send any representatives to the summit, China is using its pavilion inside the event to promote its successes.\n\nTaylor Rogers, a White House spokeswoman, criticized Mr. Newsom, saying he \"flew all the way to Brazil to tout the Green New Scam, while Californians are paying some of the highest energy prices in the country.\" In a statement, she said \"these Green Dreams are killing other countries, but will not kill ours thanks to President Trump's commonsense energy agenda.\"\n\nAs the most prominent American official at the summit, Mr. Newsom was trailed by crowds at the conference. Going from one packed event to the next, the governor stopped to talk to admirers, waved to an applauding crowd at one point and entertained questions from the media, with the United Nations security detail having trouble getting him to events on time. It was his first appearance at an international climate conference and it was all the more notable because of the absence of an official United States delegation.\n\n\"Donald Trump didn't show up at COP30 but California did,\" Mr. Newsom said.\n\nMr. Trump has disavowed global climate cooperation by withdrawing the United States from the Paris climate accord, pressured other countries to buy more American oil and gas and blocked renewable energy projects at home.\n\nMr. Newsom called the administration's pullout from the global pact \"an abomination.\" The United States is the only country to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, in which 194 other nations pledged to keep global warming to relatively safe levels.\n\nThe governor's series of events ended shortly before a group of Indigenous protesters forced their way into the venue and clashed with security guards at the entrance, according to Reuters. They were protesting the incursion of mining, logging and agriculture in forested lands.\n\nThe governor said nothing about his national ambitions, even when asked directly, insisting that he was focused on ensuring that next year's midterm elections were not undermined by the Trump administration. Mr. Newsom's trip to Belém came on the heels of a successful ballot initiative that could help California Democrats flip up to five congressional seats.\n\n\"If there's one message I want to deliver to all of you, it is that California distinguishes itself from the current occupant in the White House in Washington, D.C.,\" Mr. Newsom said. \"California is a stable and reliable partner.\"\n\nCalifornia produces more electricity from renewable energy, including solar and wind power, than any state except Texas. It established the country's first statewide cap-and-trade program, a system that allows polluters to trade permits for emissions, which Mr. Newsom recently extended to 2045.\n\nThe governor waded into issues well beyond the confines of California and climate change. He said it was \"chilling\" to see images of U.S. bombardment of suspected drug ships off the coast of Venezuela without congressional approval. He called Mr. Trump a \"bully.\"\n\nHe urged climate advocates, including in his own party, to reframe the way they talk about climate change, less in abstract terms and more as a force that affects people's pocketbooks.\n\n\"It's about affordability. It's about time we frame it accordingly,\" Mr. Newsom said of his efforts to ramp up renewable energy in his state. \"We're here to frame it in economic terms, in cost-of-living terms.\"\n\nThe Biden administration's sweeping investment in electric vehicles and renewable energy did not resonate with voters in 2024. \"We have some work to do as a party, as a nation,\" Mr. Newsom said.\n\nIn fact, concerns about the cost of fuel in California forced Mr. Newsom to go easy on oil and gas lately. Just two years ago, Mr. Newsom was a combative critic of the fossil fuel industry. In 2023, the state sued ExxonMobil, Shell, BP, ConocoPhillips and others, alleging that they had misled the public about climate change.\n\nBut this year, Mr. Newsom enacted changes to make it easier to drill for oil. Asked about that contradiction on Tuesday, he said it was a \"pragmatic\" move endorsed by the State Legislature.\n\nHe said he would sue, if necessary, to block a reported White House proposal to issue oil drilling permits off the coast of California. \"Dead on arrival,\" Mr. Newsom said. He noted that Mr. Trump had not proposed offshore drilling off the coast near Mar-a-Lago, his resort in Florida.\n\n\"Disgraceful,\" Mr. Newsom said.\n\nIvan Penn contributed reporting from São Paulo, Brazil.",

    "body": "Tuesday on ABC's \"The View,\" Sen. John Fetterman (D-PA) said he didn't need a lecture from \"extreme\" Democrats on the government shutdown.\n\nCo-host Sunny Hostin said, \"Bernie Sanders said the vote was a horrific mistake. Governor Gavin Newsom called it pathetic and a surrender. Poll after poll found more Americans on both sides of the aisle blaming Republicans. Even Marjorie Taylor Greene blamed the GOP. As you mentioned, Democrats had big wins last week, so you had momentum. Why give in now? Why bring a butter knife to a gun fight? Are you willing to gamble that the GOP will negotiate on healthcare in good faith once the government reopens? Because if that gamble is wrong, half a million Pennsylvanians that you represent, their healthcare costs will skyrocket if you are wrong. And I believe you are wrong.\"\n\nFetterman said, \"Well, first of all, MTG is quite literally the last person in America that I'm going to take advice or to get their kinds of leadership and values from. I mean, now, if Democrats are celebrating crazy pants like that, then that's on them. And I don't need an I don't need a lecture. I don't need a lecture from from whether it's Bernie or the governor in California, because they are representing very deep blue, blue kinds of populations and a lot of those things were part of the extreme.\"\n\nHe added, \"And now remember, what really needs to win to win, the big win is involving my state and other states and those things. And why have we arrived here after the election a year ago? We want to forget. We got to forget some of the things that cost us that election or and now for me, it's like, that's why I'm trying to remind people that kind of the extremism, we can't return to those kind of things and realize we need to find a way forward. And I would like to, rather than cite MTG, I'm going to cite one of the new governor elect saying that my election is not a green light to continue the shutdown, because I promise you this isn't a political game. It is viewed by that by many of us. But the reality is 42 million Americans now not sure where their next meal is going to come from because we vote like that. Or people that haven't been paid for five weeks now and that kinds of chaos. Those kinds of workers have to borrow more than half a billion dollars from their credit union just to pay the bills.\"",

    "title": "Trump wants oil drilling off the coast of California. But does anyone else?",
    "body": "There are an estimated 9.8 billion barrels of untapped oil off the coast of California and about 29.6 billion barrels in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nThe Trump administration reportedly has plans to open the waters off California's coast to new oil and gas drilling for the first time in four decades, drawing swift condemnation from Gov. Gavin Newsom, lawmakers and environmental groups who say it would be disastrous for the state's environment, economy and clean energy targets.\n\nWhether energy companies would be interested in such leases is another question. Experts say the resources are limited and oil majors may not clamor for leases that could ensnare them in the Golden State's stringent environmental policies.\n\nTrump has focused heavily on increasing fossil fuel production in the United States, yet some say offering the opportunity to drill in the Pacific is more likely a political move from an administration that has repeatedly targeted California's green ambitions.\n\nDetails of the administration's plan are still emerging, but maps from the Bureau of Ocean Energy identify four West Coast planning areas, three off the coast of California and one off Oregon and Washington. The administration is planning to propose up to six offshore lease sales off the coast of California between 2027 and 2030, according to internal documents first reported by the Washington Post.\n\nOfficials with the U.S. Interior Department declined to comment, citing the U.S. government shutdown. Last month, the administration also announced plans to open the entire 1.5 million-acre coastal plain of Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas leasing, which Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said would create jobs and strengthen U.S. energy independence.\n\nCalifornia has about two dozen operating oil platforms in state and federal waters, some of which are visible from the shore in different parts of Southern California. But new leases have not been granted in federal waters since 1984, in part due to strong opposition stemming from a 1969 oil spill off the coast of Santa Barbara that spewed an estimated 100,000 barrels of crude oil into the water and helped jumpstart the modern environmental movement.\n\nThe years that followed saw a string of actions to protect the Outer Continental Shelf from oil and gas development, including bipartisan actions from the state, Congress and presidents including George H.W. Bush and Barack Obama. In January, President Biden signed an executive order protecting more than 625 million acres of the U.S. ocean from offshore drilling, which Trump repealed on his first day back in office.\n\nOil companies have expressed some interest in new offshore leases. The American Petroleum Institute and other leading oil and gas trade groups encouraged the Trump administration in a June letter to evaluate and consider all areas of the Outer Continental Shelf for oil and gas drilling, noting that \"continuous exploration and drilling will be needed\" to ensure long-term energy security and meet U.S. energy demands into 2050.\n\nBut the opposition from California could be strong. The state has set ambitious climate goals, including reaching 100% carbon neutrality by 2045.\n\n\"Nobody really wants offshore oil, except for maybe Texas and Louisiana,\" said Clark Williams-Derry, an energy industry analyst with the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. \"In my mind, this is at least in part politically motivated rather than substantively motivated.\"\n\nTrump -- who received record donations from oil and gas companies during his 2024 presidential campaign -- has moved to block clean energy projects in the state and repeal its authority to set strict tailpipe emissions standards, among other challenges.\n\nWilliams-Derry noted that offshore oil drilling is a speculative and risk-laden venture for oil companies, and prospects are better in fracking basins in Texas and New Mexico.\n\nThe U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management's most recent federal assessment of undiscovered oil and gas resources in the Outer Continental Shelf estimates there are about 9.8 billion barrels of untapped oil off the coast of California -- the majority off Southern California -- compared with about 29.6 billion barrels in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nOffshore oil platforms often send oil ashore, requiring pipelines and other infrastructure. California isn't likely to cooperate with that onshore work, and in fact has built up something of a \"blue wall\" of opposition to offshore drilling through local resolutions and legislative efforts, according to Richard Charter, senior fellow with the nonprofit Ocean Foundation.\n\nA network of state laws such as the longstanding California Coastal Sanctuary law, the California Coastal Act, the California Environmental Quality Act and a 2025 assembly bill would effectively prevent oil companies from using existing oil and gas infrastructure in state waters to export or bring ashore new production from federal offshore leases, Charter said. State waters are the first three miles offshore.\n\n\"I think we have as many layers of protection as it is possible to get -- certainly more than any other state,\" he said, adding that \"the limited petroleum potential is not worth the effort and the risk.\"\n\nHowever, it's possible that interested oil companies could bypass the state altogether by loading crude onto tankers and shipping it elsewhere, something the Sable Offshore Corp. is now considering for its controversial project to restart oil drilling off the coast of Santa Barbara.\n\nEnergy companies have also been making use of floating oil processing centers that dramatically reduce the need for pipelines.\n\nRumors of the Trump administration's plans drew sharp criticism from state leaders, including Sen. Alex Padilla, who led an Oct. 30 letter signed by more than 100 lawmakers demanding the administration reverse course to open up the Outer Continental Shelf.\n\n\"This is a matter of national consequence for coastal communities across the country, regardless of political affiliation,\" the letter said. \"It puts our economies, national security, and our most vulnerable ecosystems at severe risk.\"\n\nThe lawmakers noted that the U.S. already leads the world in oil and gas production, and the industry already holds more than 2,000 offshore leases covering more than 12 million acres of federal waters, but fewer than 500 of those leases are actively producing oil and gas.\n\n\"There is no justification for opening vast swaths of our oceans to leasing when existing leases remain largely unused, while imposing mounting environmental and economic costs on coastal communities,\" they wrote.\n\nAt the same time, any expanded drilling would meet with weakened oil spill prevention and response programs at the the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which have lost about 30% of its staff to layoffs and buyouts and face a potential 50% budget cut.\n\nThe Trump administration has caved to at least some political pressure on the issue: The administration largely backed off plans to open the Atlantic Ocean for drilling after reports drew the ire of Republican coastal state leaders.\n\nBut advocacy groups say the administration is less likely to give favor to California, where Gov. Gavin Newsom -- a 2028 presidential contender -- has repeatedly sparred with Trump over energy and the environment. Newsom is currently at the United Nations climate conference in Brazil, which Trump opted not to attend.",

The total absence of any federal government officials at the talks only amplified the spotlight on Newsom, who was by default the highest-ranking government official from the U.S. there.",

Increasingly, the polluted heart of the climate crisis appears to be Donald Trump. As it relates to offshore oil drilling, it's overwhelmingly opposed by members of all political parties in the state of California. What's fascinating to me -- you may have seen this -- he wants to open offshore oil drilling, and he intentionally aligned that to opening of COP. Well, his weakness, by the way, masquerading as strength, that's all that was. But the answer to your question. Forgive the long-winded answer. It's dead on arrival -- dead on arrival. And I also think it remarkable that he didn't promote it in his backyard at Mar-a-Lago. He didn't promote it off the coast of Florida. That says everything about Donald Trump.",

    "body": "A poll conducted by a GOP-affiliated group reveals this outspoken Democrat outperformed the vice president by 5 points in a hypothetical 2028 matchup.\n\nDemocratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom led Vice President JD Vance among young male voters who were asked which prospective candidate they preferred in a hypothetical 2028 presidential election, according to findings by a Republican pollster.\n\nThe poll -- conducted in late October by TIPP Insight in collaboration with the League of American Workers, a GOP-affiliated organization founded by former President Donald Trump adviser Steve Cortes -- asked 2,100 registered voters age 18-25, including a sample of 1,300 men, who they would prefer between Vance or Newsom.\n\nThirty-eight percent of the young men surveyed picked the California governor, while 33% say they would rather vote for Vance. Fifteen percent said someone else, and the remaining 15% said they were unsure.\n\nNotably, 67% of the men who voted for Trump in 2024 said they would vote for Vance, while 14% of that group favored Newsom.\n\nThe survey comes amid speculation that both politicians could run for president in 2028. Newsom told CBS's Robert Costa in October he'd be lying if he said he didn't put serious thought into it, while President Donald Trump told reporters on Air Force One that a ticket with Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio would be \"unstoppable.\"\n\nLast year, The Associated Press found more than half of men under 30 supported Trump during the 2024 presidential election, partly due to his campaign reaching their demographic more effectively through nontraditional media such as podcasts.\n\nRecent polling shows the president's approval ratings at their lowest during his second term.\n\nThe California governor, who routinely uses social media to blast Trump and his MAGA allies in recent months, has fully embraced that approach in order to reach out to new supporters.\n\nHowever, Newsom received backlash from members of his own party for sitting down with right-wing figures like Charlie Kirk and Steve Bannon for his podcast, \"This Is Gavin Newsom.\"\n\n\"The reaction when I had Charlie Kirk and Bannon on was exactly to me Exhibit A of what I feel is wrong right now with my party: an unwillingness to even engage in platform, to listen,\" Newsom told The Hill.",

    "title": "AP Interview: Newsom says Trump climate-fighting absence is 'doubling down on stupid'",
    "body": "BELEM, Brazil -- Calling America's absence from key United Nations climate negotiations \"doubling down on stupid,\" California Gov. Gavin Newsom said Tuesday the United States risks being left behind as an economic power.\n\nNewsom, a Democrat eyeing a 2028 presidential run, is so far the highest profile of several U.S. governors and mayors at U.N. climate talks being hosted in Belem, Brazil. They say they are here to tell the 195 nations who are trying to fight climate change that much of the United States is doing its best despite Trump administration policies overturning environmental regulations and aiding the production of dirty fuels, such as coal, while stymying green energies like wind and solar.\n\nAs he did during his first term, President Donald Trump is also pulling America from the 2015 Paris Agreement, which set international goals to limit average global temperature rise.\n\nNewsom's presence as governor of the most populous U.S. state serves to draw a clear contrast with Trump's absence. He said Trump's decision to skip the talks tells the world: \"You don't matter, we don't care.\"\n\n\"This idea that somehow we can put up walls, we can put up barriers, we could put up tariffs, we put up our middle fingers and just turn our back is lunacy,\" Newsom said during an exclusive Associated Press interview at the climate talks in Belem, a city on the edge of the Amazon rainforest. \"And every other country in the world understands that. That's why every other country in this world is moving in a different direction.\"\n\nEven Russia and Saudi Arabia get it and are going green, but not Trump, Newsom said. U.N. organizers said only four nations are absent from the negotiations called COP30: Strife-torn Afghanistan and Myanmar, tiny San Marino and the United States, which over the century has put more heat-trapping carbon dioxide in the air than any other nation.\n\nPHOTOS: AP Interview: Newsom says Trump climate-fighting absence is 'doubling down on stupid'\n\nCalifornia, with nearly 40 million residents, is a major economic hub and on the forefront of national climate policy. But the Trump administration has sought to role back the state's power to set aggressive climate policy, most notably by blocking a California regulation to ban the sale of new gas-powered cars within the next decade.\n\n\"This Trump administration, his acolytes and the supine Congress led by Speaker (Mike) Johnson, are doubling down on stupid,\" Newsom said.\n\n\"We're ceding cheap energy, green energy, infrastructure, supply chain manufacturing. We're ceding economic power to other countries, notably China, taking advantage of that absence,\" Newsom said. \"And they're going to clean our clock economically unless we wake up to the economic imperative and opportunities of low carbon regrowth.\"\n\nTrump, who actively solicited money from the fossil fuel industry during his last campaign, has massively deregulated industry that spews heat-trapping gas and cut subsidies to renewable energy. This would give America -- the No. 1 oil producer in the world -- energy independence and cheaper prices, he has said.\n\n\"Governor Newscum flew all the way to Brazil to tout the Green New Scam, while the people of California are paying some of the highest energy prices in the country. Embarrassing!,\" White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said in a statement, using one of Trump's favored nicknames for Newsom. \"President Trump will not allow the best interest of the American people to be jeopardized by the Green Energy Scam. These Green Dreams are killing other countries, but will not kill ours thanks to President Trump's common sense energy agenda.\"\n\nClimate change is undeniable, despite Trump calling it a hoax, Newsom said.\n\n\"If you don't believe in science, and a lot of people apparently don't, you have to believe in your own eyes,\" Newsom said. \"Nighttime temperatures, record-breaking heat globally, acidification of our oceans, impacts on our coral reefs. You're not able to go where your grandfather brought you for the first time, your dad brought you and bring your kids because there's another fire and it's another closure and the air quality's been degraded.\"\n\nCalifornia has warmed 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit (1 degree Celsius) in the past 30 years and gets nearly 7 inches of rain (17.7 centimeters) less now than it did in 1995, according to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration records.\n\nSome of California's largest and most destructive wildfires in history have sparked in the last five years, including two January infernos that devastated neighborhoods in and around Los Angeles. The previous winter, meanwhile, brought record-breaking rainfall as multiple atmospheric rivers pounded the state.\n\n\"I'm just privileged to represent one of the most blessed and cursed states in the world that's on the tip of the spear of the impacts of climate change,\" Newsom said. \"How about the simultaneous crisis of wildfires, drought, and floods stacked on top of each other.\"\n\n\"Anyone paying attention here?\" added Newsom.\n\nAt home, Newsom has confronted the economic and political realities of pursuing the state's ambitious goal of by 2045 reaching carbon neutrality, or taking as much carbon pollution from the atmosphere as emitted. He recently signed legislation to boost oil production in part of the state and his party has grappled with how to confront high gas prices. California also has some of the highest electricity rates in the country.\n\nCalifornia is also dealing with the massive energy and water demands of data centers by keeping its last nuclear plant running longer than planned, adding huge chunks of solar power and battery storage and investing in nuclear fusion, Newsom said. Those energy needs will grow as AI continues to boom. Many of the nation's top AI companies are headquartered in California.\n\nVeteran climate negotiations analyst Alden Meyer of the European think tank E3G said it was unfortunate that America's federal government was not participating in the talks.\n\n\"But it is very positive that we have these other leaders from the United States that are here in Belem,\" he said.\n\n___\n\nAnton L.

Gavin Newsom was the most prominent American official to attend the COP30 global climate conference in Belém, Brazil, this week -- using the platform to criticize the absent Trump administration.\n\nThe White House mocked the trip, noting California's continued rank among the highest in U.S. energy costs.\n\nNewsom's office put out a summary of his visit to the conference, saying it shows California is \"leading by example\" and proving that \"climate action and economic growth go hand in hand.\"\n\n\"As Donald Trump abandons American climate leadership, California continues and accelerates its climate action, urging global investors to embrace the technologies and infrastructure driving the clean energy future,\" his office said in the release.\n\nNEWSOM SET TO RALLY TEXAS DEMS WITH VICTORY LAP DAYS AFTER PROP 50 PASSES: 'CALIFORNIA STEPPED UP'\n\nOn Tuesday, Newsom was scheduled to deliver remarks in his role as co-chair of America Is All In, which describes itself as a broad coalition of non-federal actors in the U.S. committed to ambitious climate action. Later, he was scheduled to attend a state-governor's coalition called U.S. Climate Alliance, and then travel into the Amazon rainforest to meet with \"community stewards.\"\n\n\"While Donald Trump is handing the future to China, California is proving that climate action, business growth, supporting workers, and good-paying jobs go hand in hand,\" Newsom said.\n\n\"We're not turning backwards to the failed policies of the past -- California is fighting for a clean-energy future, even as President Trump bends the knee to his Gulf-State patrons and takes a nap as the world burns.\"\n\nNEWSOM SAYS TRUMP HAS 'RELENTLESS, UNHINGED' OBSESSION WITH CALIFORNIA DURING STATE OF THE STATE ADDRESS\n\nNewsom made the case during remarks at the coinciding Milken Institute Global Investors Symposium in Sao Paulo that California has proved it can balance climate and environmental stewardship with economic growth.\n\n\"We're running the fourth-largest economy in the world [on] 67%; two-thirds clean energy,\" he said.\n\nNewsom claimed that nine out of 10 days this year, California operated on 100% non-fossil-fuel energy for at least part of the day:\n\nTRUMP OFFICIALS URGED TO BOYCOTT UN CLIMATE SUMMIT AS TRUMP SEETHES CLIMATE CHANGE IS A 'CON JOB'\n\n\"I don't know if there's another jurisdiction in the world that can lay claim to that.\"\n\n\"We are proving the paradigm: The genius of 'and,' not the tyranny of 'or',\" he said in remarks to Milken CEO Rich Ditizio.\n\nMeanwhile, back in Washington, White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers cited California's consumer energy costs, and claimed that Newsom would not be attending such a summit if he was sincere about the issue as thousands of acres reportedly had to be cleared for a \"special purpose highway\" into the rainforest.\n\nNEWSOM WARNS AMERICANS 'YOU WILL LOSE YOUR COUNTRY' UNDER TRUMP AT CALIFORNIA SUMMIT\n\nBelem officials denied the highway, Avenida Liberdade, was built expressly for the summit, according to reports.\n\n\"Governor Newscum (sic) flew all the way to Brazil to tout the Green New Scam, while the people of California are paying some of the highest energy prices in the country: Embarrassing,\" Rogers said.\n\n\"It's time for Newscum and other countries to drop the climate façade.

Jay Inslee claimed to the COP30 conference that the U.S. has not pulled out of the Paris climate accords.\n\n\"One part of the United States has, and that's the federal government,\" he told Germany's Deutsche Welle.\n\n\"It's not an honest organization looking to better human lives,\" Wright said, adding that he may drop in on the 2026 conference to deliver some \"common sense.\"",

    "title": "AP Interview: Newsom Says Trump Climate-Fighting Absence Is 'Doubling Down on Stupid'",
    "body": "BELEM, Brazil (AP) -- Calling America's absence from key United Nations climate negotiations \"doubling down on stupid,\" California Gov. Gavin Newsom said Tuesday the United States risks being left behind as an economic power.\n\nNewsom, a Democrat eyeing a 2028 presidential run, is so far the highest profile of several U.S. governors and mayors at U.N. climate talks being hosted in Belem, Brazil. They say they are here to tell the 195 nations who are trying to fight climate change that much of the United States is doing its best despite Trump administration policies overturning environmental regulations and aiding the production of dirty fuels, such as coal, while stymying green energies like wind and solar.\n\nAs he did during his first term, President Donald Trump is also pulling America from the 2015 Paris Agreement, which set international goals to limit average global temperature rise.\n\nNewsom's presence as governor of the most populous U.S. state serves to draw a clear contrast with Trump's absence. He said Trump's decision to skip the talks tells the world: \"You don't matter, we don't care.\"\n\n\"This idea that somehow we can put up walls, we can put up barriers, we could put up tariffs, we put up our middle fingers and just turn our back is lunacy,\" Newsom said during an exclusive Associated Press interview at the climate talks in Belem, a city on the edge of the Amazon rainforest. \"And every other country in the world understands that. That's why every other country in this world is moving in a different direction.\"\n\nGreen energy transition and China's dominance\n\nEven Russia and Saudi Arabia get it and are going green, but not Trump, Newsom said. U.N. organizers said only four nations are absent from the negotiations called COP30: Strife-torn Afghanistan and Myanmar, tiny San Marino and the United States, which over the century has put more heat-trapping carbon dioxide in the air than any other nation.\n\nCalifornia, with nearly 40 million residents, is a major economic hub and on the forefront of national climate policy. But the Trump administration has sought to role back the state's power to set aggressive climate policy, most notably by blocking a California regulation to ban the sale of new gas-powered cars within the next decade.\n\n\"This Trump administration, his acolytes and the supine Congress led by Speaker (Mike) Johnson, are doubling down on stupid,\" Newsom said.\n\n\"We're ceding cheap energy, green energy, infrastructure, supply chain manufacturing. We're ceding economic power to other countries, notably China, taking advantage of that absence,\" Newsom said. \"And they're going to clean our clock economically unless we wake up to the economic imperative and opportunities of low carbon regrowth.\"\n\nTrump, who actively solicited money from the fossil fuel industry during his last campaign, has massively deregulated industry that spews heat-trapping gas and cut subsidies to renewable energy. This would give America -- the No. 1 oil producer in the world -- energy independence and cheaper prices, he has said.\n\n\"Governor Newscum flew all the way to Brazil to tout the Green New Scam, while the people of California are paying some of the highest energy prices in the country. Embarrassing!,\" White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said in a statement, using one of Trump's favored nicknames for Newsom. \"President Trump will not allow the best interest of the American people to be jeopardized by the Green Energy Scam. These Green Dreams are killing other countries, but will not kill ours thanks to President Trump's common sense energy agenda.\"\n\nClimate impacts in California and around the world\n\nClimate change is undeniable, despite Trump calling it a hoax, Newsom said.\n\n\"If you don't believe in science, and a lot of people apparently don't, you have to believe in your own eyes,\" Newsom said. \"Nighttime temperatures, record-breaking heat globally, acidification of our oceans, impacts on our coral reefs. You're not able to go where your grandfather brought you for the first time, your dad brought you and bring your kids because there's another fire and it's another closure and the air quality's been degraded.\"\n\nCalifornia has warmed 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit (1 degree Celsius) in the past 30 years and gets nearly 7 inches of rain (17.7 centimeters) less now than it did in 1995, according to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration records.\n\nSome of California's largest and most destructive wildfires in history have sparked in the last five years, including two January infernos that devastated neighborhoods in and around Los Angeles. The previous winter, meanwhile, brought record-breaking rainfall as multiple atmospheric rivers pounded the state.\n\n\"I'm just privileged to represent one of the most blessed and cursed states in the world that's on the tip of the spear of the impacts of climate change,\" Newsom said. \"How about the simultaneous crisis of wildfires, drought, and floods stacked on top of each other.\"\n\n\"Anyone paying attention here?\" added Newsom.\n\nCalifornia's ambitious climate goals and challenges\n\nAt home, Newsom has confronted the economic and political realities of pursuing the state's ambitious goal of by 2045 reaching carbon neutrality, or taking as much carbon pollution from the atmosphere as emitted. He recently signed legislation to boost oil production in part of the state and his party has grappled with how to confront high gas prices. California also has some of the highest electricity rates in the country.\n\nCalifornia is also dealing with the massive energy and water demands of data centers by keeping its last nuclear plant running longer than planned, adding huge chunks of solar power and battery storage and investing in nuclear fusion, Newsom said. Those energy needs will grow as AI continues to boom. Many of the nation's top AI companies are headquartered in California.\n\nVeteran climate negotiations analyst Alden Meyer of the European think tank E3G said it was unfortunate that America's federal government was not participating in the talks.\n\n\"But it is very positive that we have these other leaders from the United States that are here in Belem,\" he said.\n\n___\n\nAnton L.

    "title": "Newsom meets the global climate moment",
    "body": "CALIFORNIA TAKEOVER: Gov. Gavin Newsom is asserting himself on the global climate stage just as President Donald Trump and the United States are retreating on climate change.\n\nThe governor and a Golden State delegation are in Brazil this week at the annual climate summit known as COP30.\n\nAs we've reported, the Trump administration isn't sending any top officials to the conference, giving Newsom an extra spotlight fresh off his Proposition 50 gerrymandering victory and as perhaps the biggest-name American government official in attendance.\n\n\"This is the first time he's actually been to one of these conferences as governor, and he couldn't have picked a better moment for it,\" said POLITICO'S Camille von Kaenel, who's trailing the governor in South America.\n\nWe chatted with Camille as she headed from Newsom's first stop in São Paulo to Belém, the COP30 host city near the Amazon River.\n\nCan you explain the significance of COP30 and Newsom's presence there?\n\nCOP is an annual conference put on by the United Nations on climate change. One of the high points of this series of conferences came 10 years ago when countries negotiated the Paris Agreement to keep global emissions in check. So it's a big deal.\n\nCalifornia sends a big delegation every year, just because it's a kind of a big player in this space. But Newsom has never been to one himself. So this is the first time he's actually been to one of these conferences as governor, and he couldn't have picked a better moment for it. He's riding high politically in the country after Prop 50. He's going after Trump on all sorts of different fronts.\n\nAnd this is just another way for him to draw contrast with the president, because the U.S. government is sending zero representatives to this COP. It was a major player 10 years ago in the Paris Agreement, so it's a big difference. And people on the ground are wondering, \"What's up with the U.S.?\" And they're looking to California to step in a little bit.\n\nIs there a reason it was important for Newsom to go this year, of all years?\n\nWade Crowfoot, the [California] Natural Resources secretary who's been going to these COPs every year, told me that this was the most important year for a California governor to go, Prop 50 aside, just because of the Trump administration's absence.\n\nAnd not only absence, but sort of active dismantling of climate policy. Just a few weeks ago, Trump tanked a global deal to put a carbon tax on shipping with a tweet, so he can still influence the negotiations even without sending people here.\n\nWhat is the biggest topic of discussion at COP that could involve California?\n\nCOP is always kind of a show, and the hosts have quite an influence, and can shape the agenda to a degree. Brazilian organizers have focused this COP on implementation, basically getting to these emissions goals, and on nature and forests.\n\nAnd there's some parallels to the U.S. situation in that under President Jair Bolsonaro, the consortium of Brazilian states got together in a sort of climate alliance -- sort of like the climate alliance that U.S. states formed under the first Trump administration that continues to this day.\n\nSo there is this sense of -- even from the Brazil organizers -- climate action can happen at the sub-national level. So California fits right into that frame.\n\nTo be clear, California can't actually participate in the negotiations between nations. Like their closed-door meetings are just for representatives of countries.\n\nYou sat down with Newsom in São Paulo -- what were your takeaways on how he wants to maximize his COP experience?\n\nHe seems pretty fired up. Monday, he spoke to an investor summit put on by the Milken Institute, and it was this crowd of bankers. And Newsom came in, and it sounded like a campaign rally. He was talking about Trump and describing this vacuum left by Trump and how California was going to step in and be a stable and reliable partner.\n\nSo it's clear that he sees this moment for what it is, in terms of the contrast between California and Trump, and he's trying to seize that moment. He also said that he's getting bombarded by meeting requests, and that was clear even today at this conference.\n\nThere's people following him in the hallways, asking him for selfies, asking him for meetings, being like, \"Can you meet with my CEO?\"... Even before he got to the actual talks, he was already getting bombarded with meeting requests in São Paulo, 1,800 miles away. So there's a lot of interest in him being here.\n\nIT'S TUESDAY AFTERNOON. This is California Playbook PM, a POLITICO newsletter that serves as an afternoon temperature check on California politics and a look at what our policy reporters are watching. Got tips or suggestions? Shoot an email to [email protected].\n\nEVEN MORE FROM BRAZIL: Newsom today commiserated with the governor of the state of Pará, Helder Barbalho, who convinced Brazilian leaders to host the United Nations talks in his home city, Camille reports.\n\nThis morning, the two met at a cultural center near a confluence of rivers flowing out of the Amazon region. Newsom saw and heard about the products his Brazilian counterpart is trying to sustainably produce out of the Amazon, like tapioca flour and açai juice (which he sipped on) and toured the center's experimental machinery, which was processing and pumping out starch and juices, and an exhibit on Indigenous art. Then the two signed a voluntary agreement focused on forest health and the prevention of wildfires, which have broken records in both states in recent years.\n\nBarbalho told reporters after the tour he wanted the agreement to bring Silicon Valley-style innovation to the Amazon. Newsom said he was inspired: \"I couldn't be more enlivened and optimistic about the future here, and also the future of the rainforest,\" Newsom said. \"I've never seen anything like this.\"\n\nThe two were trailed by two members of the dozen Brazilian press, and POLITICO overheard Newsom joke to Barbalho: \"You're just more popular than I am.\" A Brazilian passerby appeared to recognize Newsom, shouting, \"There's the governor. And the governor of California.\"\n\nBACK TO BLUE: Latino voters, who swung toward Trump in 2024, boomeranged back to Democrats last week, signaling the fraying of his coalition less than one year into his second term, Madison Fernandez, Jessica Piper and Melanie Mason report.\n\nFew places across the country epitomize that swing like New Jersey's Passaic County, a densely populated, geographically diverse region where Latinos comprise a plurality. Voters there supported Trump by a narrow margin in 2024, only to back Democratic Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill by double-digits last week.\n\nIn Virginia, the other state with a gubernatorial contest last week, the two most heavily Latino cities swung toward Democratic Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger by more than 15 points each.\n\nAnd in California, support for a Democratic-backed ballot measure exceeded Kamala Harris' share by roughly 12 points in Imperial County, where Latino residents make up 77 percent of the population. That marks the biggest swing of any county in the state.\n\nTEFLON ESSAYLI? Defense attorneys are taking another shot at ousting Trump administration appointee Bill Essayli as the top federal prosecutor in Los Angeles, Josh Gerstein reports.\n\nIn a motion filed late Monday night, attorneys from the federal defenders office asked U.S. District Judge Michael Seabright to reverse part of a ruling he issued last month that stripped Essayli of his title as acting U.S. attorney but allowed him to keep supervising that office in his capacity as first assistant U.S. attorney.\n\nSeabright, a Hawaii-based George W. Bush appointee assigned due to conflict-of-interest issues raised by having judges in the same California district resolve the dispute, concluded that the reappointment maneuver was unlawful. However, he said Essayli could keep running the office without the \"acting\" title.\n\nIn the new filing, defense lawyers argue that Essayli's current role is one of an \"inferior officer\" under the Constitution and requires Senate confirmation unless Congress has explicitly authorized another mechanism of appointment.\n\n-- University of California student leaders are pushing for more representation on the Board of Regents.

    "body": "BELEM, Brazil -- California Gov. Gavin Newsom said Tuesday he's stunned by eight senators' decision to break with Democrats and end the government shutdown and warned they're not alarmed enough about President Donald Trump's political norm-shattering.\n\n\"I'm not coming in to punch anybody in the face, but I'm not pleased that, in the face of this invasive species that is Donald Trump, who's completely changed the rules of the game, that we're still playing by the old rules of the game,\" Newsom told The Associated Press in an interview at the COP30 UN Climate Conference in Brazil. \"And in my core, I'm stunned.\"\n\nNewsom was asked what he would say to the group of seven Democrats and one independent senator who joined with Republicans in the Senate late Monday to pass legislation to reopen the government, bringing the longest shutdown in history closer to an end. Along with the ratified deal came searing criticism for the moderates from other Democrats, frustrated by what they said amounted to caving to the GOP without achieving lasting progress toward extending health care subsidies set to expire Jan. 1.\n\nAs news of potential compromise neared ahead of a procedural Sunday night vote to advance the overall funding legislation, Newsom's press office wrote on X, \"Pathetic. This isn't a deal. It's a surrender. Don't bend the knee!\" After the same eight senators -- seven Democrats and independent Sen. Angus King of Maine, who caucuses with Democrats -- joined with Republicans in that procedural vote, he called their conciliation \"capitulation and a betrayal of working Americans.\"\n\nThe group of defectors consisted of several senators who are retiring next year, as well as a number of former governors. Since making their moves, several have acknowledged they viewed the deal as imperfect but necessary to end the shutdown, which has meant missed paychecks, stoppages in federal food aid and travel headaches for millions across the country.\n\nAsked by AP about his own efforts to counter Trump, from a bombastic social media presence to last week's successful passage of U.S. House maps for California aimed at countering Trump-backed efforts to do the same for Republicans in other states, Newsom reiterated what he framed as his commitment to go further than others in his party.\n\n\"I'm really more alarmed than it appears the eight members of my party are in the United States Senate,\" Newsom said. \"I'm much more alarmed about the future of our country and the world we're trying to build than they are.\"\n\nThe Trump administration did not send an official delegation to COP30 in Brazil this week. Newsom, whose state represents the world's fourth-largest economy, is expected to meet with officials from some of the 195 global governments in attendance.",

    "title": "Nolte: Newsom, Democrats, and Jon Stewart Furious Needy Will Receive Food Stamps",
    "body": "The fury from far-left elected Democrats, and socialists like Jon Stewart, over the federal government reopening tells you they don't give a damn about the poor going hungry.\n\nThey wanted the government to remain closed. Even though if the government had not reopened, millions would not have received their monthly SNAP payment, which is the federal government's food stamp program.\n\nHere's oh-so compassionate Jon Stewart speaking for the Democrat party as he rages against reopening the government...\n\n\"They fucking caved on the shutdown, not even a full week removed from the best election night results they've had in years,\" Stewart screeched. \"You had the wind at your back, election victories all over the country... Democrats, you sold out the entire shutdown not to get what you wanted but for a promise not to get what you wanted later.\"\n\nHere's the Democrat party's 2028 presidential frontrunner, California Gov. Gavin Newsom, on the vote to reopen the government: \"Pathetic. This isn't a deal. It's a surrender. Don't bend the knee!\"\n\nRELATED VIDEO -- Zeldin: Newsom and Bass \"Need to Get Off of Their Asses\" and Rebuild from L.A. Fires:\n\nThe Democrat party as a whole was so opposed to reopening the government and ensuring people got their food stamps that the U.S. senators trotted out by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) to finally break the filibuster are the senators least vulnerable to a primary challenge. They are not up for reelection next year.\n\nIt just goes to prove that Democrats, including people like Jon Stewart and the party's base of activists and fundraisers, really were and are willing to see needy people go hungry if that's what it takes to ensure taxpayers foot the bill for illegal aliens to receive health care and the wealthy to continue to receive Obamacare subsidies.\n\nYes, I realize SNAP is a corrupt disaster that is abused and filled with waste and fraud. But I'm also aware that some people truly need it. What about those people, Democrats? What about those people, Jon Stewart, George Soros, Jimmy Kimmel, et al?\n\nAnd this wasn't even really about Obamacare subsidies. Jon Stewart, Gavin, and the rest were willing to see people go hungry just to stick it to Trump. That's what this 40-day shutdown was really about -- humbling Trump by forcing him and the GOP to cave on something, anything -- even if needy people had to go without.\n\nWATCH -- The Democrats' Shutdown Hypocrisy Is Shamefully Obvious:\n\nThe whole shutdown was a joke. Republicans only wanted to pass a resolution that would keep spending at its current level. In exchange for a clear continuing resolution, the GOP asked for nothing new -- no add-ons, nothing. It was Democrats who wanted to change the rules and use a shutdown for leverage, even though a shutdown would mean no food stamps for the needy and hell raining down on travelers as air traffic controllers went unpaid.\n\nWhen will people understand that Democrats and people like Jon Stewart, Gavin Newsom, and George Soros are monsters willing to sacrifice their health and safety to obtain power?\n\nThese people are queering your kids, destroying women's sports, releasing the worst offenders from prison, importing the unvetted third world by the millions, and willing to see you go hungry just to get what they want.\n\nMonsters. Time and again they prove it, but the dummies keep right on voting for them.",

    "title": "Newsom Calls Trump Offshore Oil Drilling Plan 'Dead on Arrival'",
    "body": "(Bloomberg) -- California Governor Gavin Newsom declared a planned Trump administration proposal to sell new oil drilling rights off the US West Coast \"dead on arrival.\"\n\nThe draft proposal prepared by administration officials, first reported by Bloomberg in October, sets the stage for government auctions of oil and gas leases in US Pacific waters. The administration also is set to outline potential sales of drilling rights in waters near Alaska and in the Gulf of Mexico, which was renamed the Gulf of America by President Donald Trump.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHowever, Trump administration officials have now ruled out new offshore oil leasing along the US East Coast, after an initial plan for auctioning territory there drew alarm from Republican officials.\n\nThe plan is \"dead on arrival in California -- dead on arrival,\" Newsom told reporters on the sidelines of the COP30 climate summit in Belém, Brazil.\n\nIt's \"interesting he didn't put it in front of Mar-a-Lago,\" Newsom added, referring to Trump's Florida resort. \"It's disgraceful.\"\n\nWhite House spokespeople did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nOil companies have shown limited appetite to explore new US waters far beyond the Gulf, where they could confront political opposition as well as geological risk. However the Pacific waters near southern California have produced crude for decades -- and Interior Department documents seen by Bloomberg note there is \"industry interest\" in fresh drilling in the region.\n\nThe Interior Department's draft is an initial step in assembling a new five-year blueprint for selling Outer Continental Shelf oil leases from 2026 to 2031. If finalized, it would replace a program developed under former President Joe Biden that scheduled just three auctions from 2024 to 2029. The process typically begins with an expansive initial draft, with the proposal being whittled down ahead of being finalized.\n\nThe West Coast states of California, Oregon and Washington already have registered their disinterest with the Interior Department, according to the agency documents. Under federal law, Interior Department officials are supposed to consult with states and consider their views while developing the leasing plans.\n\nNewsom, a Democratic governor who is considering a bid for the presidency in 2028, has used a visit Tuesday to the UN summit in Brazil to emphasize that US states and local governments are committed to battling climate change -- even as Trump retreats from the fight.",

I got along great with him, but he's gone radical Left, and you know, he's building a train system from San Francisco to L.A. that's got about a 2000 percent or 3,000 percent cost overruns. The worst thing -- I've never seen anything like it. I've seen cost overruns. I've never seen anything like that. If you take a look at what he's done, so they lost 25,000 houses. Do you know they haven't issued one building permit yet? So these people are trying to rebuild the houses.\n\nBut he did something -- he did something even worse than that. He's now taking a big section of Palisades or some area, and he's going to build low-income housing, where they used to have luxury housing. He's going to put low-income housing in. His fire stuff is out of control. The forests are burning down all over the place. And honestly, I always liked him, but he's a horrible governor. He's a horrible governor.

    "body": "\"You had momentum. Why give in now?\" the ABC host asks the Democratic senator\n\nSenator John Fetterman was one of the handful of Democrats who opted to vote alongside Republicans to reopen the government over the weekend, and during his Tuesday appearance on \"The View,\" host Sunny Hostin called him out directly for it. According to the ABC host, he and his colleagues brought \"a butter knife to a gunfight.\"\n\nHostin was quick to point out that fellow Democrats like Sen. Bernie Sanders called the move a \"horrific mistake,\" while California governor Gavin Newsom called it \"pathetic\" and a \"surrender. The ABC host also questioned the decision following Democrats' sweeping victories on election night last Tuesday.\n\n\"Poll after poll found more Americans on both sides of the aisle blaming Republicans. Even Marjorie Taylor Greene blamed the GOP!\" Hostin said. \"As you mentioned, Democrats had big wins last week. So you had momentum. Why give in now? Why bring a butter knife to a gunfight?!\"\n\nOn Sunday, Fetterman and nine other Democrats teamed with Republicans on a deal, despite the rest of the Democratic party remaining steadfast against it until Republicans agreed not to strip ACA subsidies from millions of people. Instead, Republicans simply promised to vote on the health care issue, but did not set a date for that vote, or promise that the subsidies would actually remain intact.\n\n\"Are you willing to gamble that the GOP will negotiate on health care in good faith once the government reopens?\" Hostin pressed. \"Because if that gamble is wrong, half a million Pennsylvanians, that you represent, their health care costs will skyrocket if you are wrong! And I believe you are wrong!\"\n\nFor his part, Fetterman maintained his calm and immediately dismissed the idea of ever taking any cues from Marjorie Taylor Greene.\n\n\"If Democrats are celebrating Crazy Pants like that, then that's on them,\" he said. \"And I don't need a lecture from, whether it's Bernie or the governor in California, because they are representing very deep blue kinds of populations. And a lot of those things were part of the extreme.\"\n\nFetterman argued against leaning extremely to one side, considering purple states like his.",

    "body": "BELEM, Brazil (Reuters) -California Governor Gavin Newsom has arrived in the Amazon city of Belem with a message for the COP30 summit: his state will continue to be a \"reliable partner\" on climate policy and green technology despite Washington's abandonment of the effort.\n\nA strident political foe of U.S. President Donald Trump, Newsom has for months been teasing a run for the White House in 2028. On Tuesday and Wednesday, he is expected to meet with officials from some of the 195 governments attending this year's U.N. climate negotiations.\n\nHe has planned meetings with a series of subnational leaders, including the governor of Brazil's state of Para, the location of the summit.\n\nThough California is just one of 50 U.S. states, its economy is the world's fourth-largest - making it a key player in influencing markets and energy policy.\n\n\"The reason I'm here is in the absence of leadership coming from the United States,\" he said at an investors summit in Brazil's financial hub of Sao Paulo on Monday. \"This vacuum, it's rather jaw-dropping.\"\n\nNewsom has touted California's embrace of green tech, highlighting that the state has seven times more renewable energy jobs than fossil fuel jobs and reminding people that EV giant Tesla was founded in California. This is in sharp contrast to Washington's climate denial and determination to boost global use of polluting fossil fuels.\n\nNewsom also lamented the U.S. rollback on clean energy policy as ceding the fast-growing green-tech market to China.\n\n\"China gets it,\" Newsom told investors. \"United States is toast competitively if we don't wake up to what the hell they're doing in this space, on supply chains, how they're dominating manufacturing, how they're flooding the zone here, EU, elsewhere, Africa.\"\n\nChina not only dominates the markets for electric vehicles, renewable energy components and batteries, he said, but it also leads in software while U.S. automakers like General Motors are \"trying to recreate the 19th century,\" Newsom said. GM recently slowed its production of EVs.\n\nThe United States has conspicuously snubbed this year's COP30 summit, with Trump falsely declaring climate change a hoax.\n\nSome diplomats worried that Trump's Republican administration might try to disrupt the summit from afar.\n\nNewsom, a Democrat, said last month that he is mulling a presidential run in 2028. He has started to parrot Trump's brash style of messaging on social media.\n\nLast week, California voters backed his proposal to redraw the state's voting districts to offset redistricting in other states aimed at boosting the number of congressional seats held by Republicans.\n\nNewsom told investors in Sao Paulo that Trump was emulating Russia and Saudi Arabia in turning the United States into a \"petro state\" and embracing Chinese-style \"state capitalism\" over the free market. He criticized Trump's aggressive tariff policies as \"madness from an investment perspective.\"\n\n\"I feel like it's modeled a little bit on President Xi, not President Reagan. The hell's going on?\" he said.\n\n(Reporting by Valerie Volcovici in Belem, Brazil; Editing by Katy Daigle and Matthew Lewis)",

    "title": "Trump administration skips COP30 climate summit, leaving California's Newsom to hurl criticism from Brazil",
    "body": "Ramy Inocencio is a CBS News foreign correspondent based in London, covering Europe and the Middle East. He joined the Network in 2019 as CBS News' Asia correspondent, based in Beijing and reporting across the Asia-Pacific, bringing two decades of experience working and traveling between Asia and the United States.\n\nIn Belém, the bustling Brazilian gateway to the Amazon rainforest, leaders from nearly 200 nations have gathered for the United Nations' 30th Climate Change Conference, known as COP30, to chart difficult next steps in the global fight against climate change. But the absence of the leaders from the world's three largest greenhouse gas emitters -- China, the United States and India -- cast a shadow over the summit as it kicked off.\n\nBeijing and New Delhi did dispatch senior-level delegations for the two-week summit. The White House, however, said no high-level U.S. officials would attend this year's COP. President Trump has repeatedly dismissed human-caused climate change as \"a hoax.\"\n\nTwo Democratic governors, California's Gavin Newsom and New Mexico's Michelle Lujan Grisham, were in Brazil to attend the summit, representing state-level U.S. efforts to curb emissions.\n\n\"What the hell is going on here?\" Newsom asked at a global investors' summit in São Paulo on Monday, where he fired off a characteristic criticism of the Trump administration. \"We're in Brazil -- one of our great trading partners, one of the world's great democracies. Home to all the rare earth metals we need. This is the country we should be engaging with, not slapping with 50% tariffs.\"\n\nTen years ago, 195 nations taking part in the COP21 summit signed onto the landmark Paris Agreement, intended to commit individual nations to take measures that, collectively, would limit the rise in average global temperatures to \"well below\" 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit). The objective in the agreement, which the Obama administration signed, was to pursue efforts to cap the global temperature increase at 1.5°C (2.7°F) above pre-industrial levels.\n\nThat target now appears out of reach.\n\nBased on national plans submitted this year, the planet is on course to warm by roughly 2.5°C (4.5°F) during this century. The Earth's average surface temperature in 2024 was the hottest since record keeping began in 1880 -- and the last 10 years have all ranked among the warmest ever observed.\n\nStill, U.N. Climate Change Executive Secretary Simon Stiell told delegates in Brazil this week that after three decades of dedicated talks, \"we are now bending the curve of planet heating emissions downwards -- for the very first time.\"\n\n\"I am not sugarcoating it,\" Stiell hastened to add. \"We have so much more work to do.\"\n\nA new U.N. analysis released this week shows that, if current national commitments are met, global emissions should fall by about 12% by 2035 compared to 2019 levels. That's an improvement from last month's projection of 10%, but still far short of the 60% reduction scientists say would be needed to keep warming within the Paris Agreement's 1.5°C goal.\n\nU.N. Secretary-General António Guterres has been pressing for stronger action, warning that surpassing the 1.5°C limit now looks almost inevitable and slamming it as both a \"moral failure\" and \"deadly negligence\" putting the lives of billions of people at risk.\n\nDespite low expectations for any sweeping breakthroughs, the delegations at COP30 are broadly expected to update national commitments to curb emissions in the next decade.\n\nA Brazil-led initiative to raise $125 billion for rainforest protection, coupled with renewed scrutiny of fossil fuel companies -- which Guterres accused of \"holding back change\" while collecting record profits and government subsidies -- were also expected to come out of the two-week gathering.\n\nThere is also likely to be more pressure applied on the governments of wealthy nations to help finance climate adaptations around the world, to help developing countries mitigate the impacts of a warming planet.\n\nAt last year's COP29 in Baku, Azerbaijan, countries agreed on an aspirational goal of mobilizing $1.3 trillion annually by 2035, with at least $300 billion expected to come from developing economies.\n\nPublicly available data on how much climate finance has actually been delivered since then, however, remains scarce, and that could be a key point of contention for the negotiators gathered in Belém to discuss.",

    "title": "Newsom Says Trump Gave 'Middle Finger' to Brazil over Tariffs",
    "body": "California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) scolded President Donald Trump on Monday for giving Brazil \"the middle finger\" by daring to impose tariffs on the South American nation.\n\nNewsom, speaking at a Milken Institute event in São Paulo ahead of the COP30 climate doomer summit, lashed out at Trump for not participating in the conference hosted by the Brazilian government at the city of Belém.\n\n\"The hell's going on in my country? Not one person from the administration. Show any respect to any of you. Forget politics. Disrespect. We're in Brazil. One of our great trading partners. One of the world's great democracies,\" Newsom said.\n\n\"I mean, hell, home to all the -- you need rare earth minerals. This is the country we should be engaging in. Instead, middle finger with 50 percent tariffs. That's shameful. Forgive me. That's an aside. Sorry,\" he continued.\n\nNewsom is presently visiting Brazil and is expected to travel to Belém this Tuesday to participate in COP30. The California governor told Politico he and his team were getting a \"disproportionate number of calls\" to meet on the sidelines of the event.\n\nLike many other international heads of state, Trump did not attend last week's COP30 Summit hosted by leftist President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, a two-day presidential gathering that served as an opening event to the broader series of COP30-related activities that will run in Belém through Friday, November 21.\n\nThe United States government did not send any high-level representative to the ongoing climate doom conference. Newsom told Politico that \"not even a note taker\" was sent by the U.S. government.\n\n\"We're at peak influence because of the flatness of the surrounding terrain with the Trump administration and all the anxiety,\" Newson reportedly asserted.\n\nRELATED: Zeldin -- Newsom and Bass \"Need to Get Off of Their Asses\" and Rebuild from L.A. Fires\n\nPolitico reported in addition to holding meetings with German and Chilean representatives, Newsom is expected to give plenary remarks and will then visit the Amazon rainforest to meet with indigenous communities.\n\nAsked by Brazilian press on whether he would run for president, Newsom answered, \"Nothing else matters but 2026 and taking back the House of Representatives.\"\n\nIn July, President Trump signed an executive order identifying Brazil as a national security threat and imposed a 50 percent tariff on the country, citing the political persecution of conservative former President Jair Bolsonaro and the numerous acts of persecution and censorship committed by Brazilian Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes.\n\nDe Moraes and other members of the top court sentenced Bolsonaro to 27 years in prison for \"crimes against democracy.\"\n\nAt press time, the court has not determined which reclusion center Bolsonaro will serve the sentence at. The former president, presently under a strict house arrest, was diagnosed with skin cancer in August. After months of continued refusal, Lula finally met with Trump in late October to discuss tariffs.",

    "body": "OPPOSITES ATTRACT -- Gavin Newsom and Zohran Mamdani are the new stars on the left in America -- an odd pairing of a governor who occasionally pivots to the center and a mayor-elect who embraces socialism.\n\nThe two hadn't even communicated until Election Day, but since then, Newsom and Mamdani have been bound together as two of the most prominent figures in the Democratic Party -- representing the poles in a party divided over ideology and that no longer has a clear national leader.\n\nAs Jeremy B. White, Nick Reisman and Camille von Kaenel report this morning, their differences are stark. Newsom has been the establishment-sanctioned favorite in every race since he emerged from San Francisco's centrist ranks, infuriating his party's left flank at times on issues like tech regulation and transgender rights. Mamdani, a democratic socialist, not only came from outside the political hierarchy but stunned New York kingmakers by riding an affordability platform to victory.\n\nBut for all their differences, the two represent a shift in Democratic politics: combativeness coupled with a savvy for modern campaigning and a return to the antagonistic posture that powered Democrats at the opening of Donald Trump's first term.\n\n\"Voters are looking for people who represent the exact opposite of what appear to be strategic, thoughtful, overly political, overly insidery approaches,\" said Evan Roth Smith, a Democratic strategist and pollster. \"Newsom and Mamdani represent a repudiation of the practice of politics that the Democratic Party has become accustomed to.\"\n\nNow, the two are bashing the Trump administration from opposite coasts. Their recent wins -- Newsom on redistricting and Mamdani in the mayoral race -- have some Democrats fantasizing over the idea of re-building a big tent.\n\n\"It shows the breadth of the party that these two people came out of election night as the big winners,\" said Katie Merrill, a California-based Democratic consultant, arguing the outcome showcased two different directions for the party: \"the Mamdani way,\" responding to Trump and MAGA by going as far left as possible, or \"the Newsom way,\" which is more strategic and establishment-friendly.\n\nRead the full story on how Newsom and Mamdani are reshaping politics.\n\nGOOD MORNING.

In Brazil attending COP.\n\nCANDIDATE SPRINGS ANEW -- Democrat Marc Iannarino, a bartender and Navy veteran who lives in Palm Springs, is running for Rep. Darrell Issa's spot in Congress.\n\nHe's entering the crowded race for the 48th District, which Proposition 50 turned from Republican-slanted to a competitive contest with the aim of electing a Democrat. Issa has not announced his 2026 plans, but could run in that district or against fellow GOP incumbent Reps. Ken Calvert and Young Kim for a newly safe red seat.\n\nIannarino in an interview ahead of his launch criticized Issa for health care spending votes as he touted his working-class roots and said he's \"not interested\" in accepting corporate PAC money.\n\n\"My family and my friends would be upset at me if I passed laws to raise the price of health care, if I passed laws that allowed tariffs,\" Iannarino said.\n\nBut it was President Donald Trump's deployment of National Guard members to U.S. cities that ultimately pushed Iannarino to run for office, he said. \"Watching troops used to intimidate citizens, well, that was a major red line for me.\"\n\nSOCAL SHUFFLE -- Democratic Rep. Linda Sánchez confirmed Monday -- as was widely expected -- that she's running in the new, now safely Democratic 41st District drawn by Prop 50. Within hours, Pico Rivera Councilmember Monica Sánchez entered the race for the nearby 38th District, which Linda Sánchez is vacating, with the representative's endorsement.\n\nThat tees up a Dem-on-Dem contest for the new, solidly blue 38th between Monica Sánchez and Los Angeles County Supervisor Hilda Solis, who has been running since August in anticipation of the gerrymander succeeding. Solis has drawn support from Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass and Reps. Judy Chu, Lou Correa, Laura Friedman, Robert Garcia and Luz Rivas, while Rep. Norma Torres and several local mayors have endorsed Monica Sánchez.\n\nFIRST IN PLAYBOOK: LEANING MOD -- Rep. Zoe Lofgren is endorsing moderate Assemblymember Jasmeet Bains over progressive Visalia school board member Randy Villegas as the two Democrats compete to challenge Republican Rep. David Valadao in the Central Valley. Valadao's district, already a battleground, will become more competitive for Democrats under Prop 50 and is one of the five districts the measure targeted.\n\nPELOSI PIVOT -- Christine Pelosi said Monday that she will run for a California state Senate seat, passing on a campaign for the House seat held for decades by her mother, former Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\n\nThe younger Pelosi, an attorney and veteran party organizer, had long been considered a potential successor to her mother, who announced last week that she's not running for another term next year. Nancy Pelosi's impending retirement has set off a cascade of maneuvering in the city as Democrats seize on the rare opening, but in a video posted online Monday, her daughter said her sights were set on Sacramento instead.\n\n\"I'm running to represent you, San Francisco, in Sacramento,\" she said in a video posted on social media. \"What do we do when our freedoms are under attack? We speak up, we fight back and we organize. Power for the people.\"\n\nTURNING POINT AT BERKELEY -- The final stop on Turning Point USA's fall college tour following the assassination of its founder, Charlie Kirk, drew over 150 protesters to UC Berkeley on Monday night, by campus estimates. Outside Zellerbach Hall, demonstrators of the conservative youth organization shouted chants like \"No Trump, no KKK, no fascist USA\" and displayed a giant sign that read \"TPUSA Out Of The Bay,\" Eric He reported from campus.\n\nThe protests and clashes outside provided a foil for the event's speakers, who cast the dissent as an attempt to crack down on discourse. \"I'd like to thank Antifa for the welcoming,\" said comedian Rob Schneider, one of the headline speakers.\n\nINJECTING A RIFT -- Labor's yearslong campaign against community clinics in the Legislature and on the ballot is now bleeding into the governor's race.\n\nAfter Playbook reported that the clinics' California Primary Care Association Advocates endorsed former Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra, state Superintendent Tony Thurmond called on him to reject the organization's backing while calling it \"anti-labor.\"\n\nThurmond's camp pointed to a fact sheet on the clinics' website that called a SEIU-UHW-backed ballot measure \"a shameful power play by SEIU-UHW executives who are weaponizing the ballot measure process to force their demands.\"\n\n\"It's unacceptable that the California Primary Care Association Advocates' website is openly attacking healthcare workers and their union SEIU UHW, engaging in fear-mongering and misleading the public,\" Thurmond said in a statement. \"I won't stand for it, and neither should Xavier Becerra.\"\n\nSEIU pushed a bill this year to place restrictions on how clinics can spend their budgets, and then SEIU-UHW put a similar proposal forward as a 2026 ballot measure.\n\nThurmond, trailing Becerra and others in polls and fundraising, will likely need labor spending to make his campaign competitive. He called on Becerra to go further and disavow the union's support, but Becerra did not oblige.\n\n\"Considering last week's favorable Berkeley IGS poll, pivotal endorsements from the Laborers union and California's community health centers, and Secretary Becerra's extensive record of taking on and beating the Trump Administration, it's no surprise candidates are lining up to take a swing at him -- it's clear that Xavier Becerra is now the candidate to beat in this race,\" a spokesperson for his campaign said, referencing a recent poll that showed Becerra trailing only former Rep. Katie Porter on the Democratic side.\n\nFrancisco Silva, the president and CEO of the clinics group, only reiterated his support for Becerra in response, saying, \"CPCA Advocates will always stand for patients, no matter the politics. And we support those who share that value.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Becerra added another endorser, Rep. Gil Cisneros, who said in a statement that the former representative's background on the Hill, in the Biden administration and the California attorney general's office \"has prepared him to move our state toward a stronger, healthier future.\"\n\n-- with help from Rachel Bluth\n\nGET IN LINE -- The hottest ticket at the UN climate talks kicking off in Brazil might just be a meeting with Newsom, our Camille von Kaenel writes from São Paulo.\n\nNewsom couldn't walk halfway down a hallway Monday without fielding requests for a meeting -- or a selfie. One Brazilian picture-taker had him repeat the Portuguese word for \"Let's go\": \"Vamos.\" His first question from the Brazilian press on Monday: whether he would run for president (\"Nothing else matters but 2026 and taking back the House of Representatives,\" he said). Read more from last night's California Climate on Newsom's hero's welcome -- and what awaits him at the talks kicking off in Belém on Tuesday.\n\nLATINO VOTER POWER -- While ballots are still being counted, it appears that Prop 50 will earn a significantly higher share of the vote than Kamala Harris did in California last fall. The San Francisco Chronicle ran statistical tests on the returns, and found that:\n\n\"No demographic factor better correlated with the difference in support between Prop 50 and Harris than the Latino share of a county's population. That is, the more Latino a county, the more it appears to have swung in favor of Prop 50. The less Latino -- and the whiter -- a county, the likelier it was to have supported Prop 50 by less than it did Harris.\"\n\nPET CEMETERY -- San Francisco Supervisor Isabella \"Beya\" Alcaraz, whom Mayor Daniel Lurie recently appointed, previously owned a pet store that reportedly was left in a state of squalor. As The San Francisco Standard reports, the current owner of the store alleges that she found hundreds of dead mice and \"dozens of deceased pets\" stored in a freezer.\n\nThe Standard said Alcaraz did not respond to questions about her business, and instead released a statement: \"Our small businesses are what makes the Sunset the best place to live,\" she said. \"Any small business owner can tell you that running one isn't easy -- but since the day I took over, my goal has always been to ensure The Animal Connection could continue bringing joy to our community.\"\n\n-- Assemblymember James Gallagher is still pushing a GOP-backed proposal to divide California into two states -- an effort he said Proposition 50 emboldens. (SF Gate)\n\n-- Oakland Unified School District Superintendent Denise Saddler warned that the embattled district must make severe cuts to stay afloat. (The Mercury News)\n\n-- The home at the center of a bribery scandal involving former Orange County Supervisor Andrew Do, who was sentenced to five years in prison, has sold for $1.1 million. (LAist)\n\nWEDDING BELLS -- Heidi Sieck, co-founder at VoteProChoice, and Alex Tourk, principal at Ground Floor Public Affairs, announce their impending nuptials. The couple have been friends for 25 years and fell in love 3.5 years ago on Friday the 13th in New York City. They will have a private wedding ceremony with their children at Congregation Emanu-El officiated by Rabbi Ryan Bauer and a small celebration at Bix in San Francisco.\n\nPEOPLE MOVES -- Bloom Energy has hired Sara O'Neill as vice president of policy and government affairs. She was previously on the executive leadership team at Aera Energy, LLC for six years.\n\nBIRTHDAYS -- Malia Arenas, associate at ALZA Strategies ... former Sen. Barbara Boxer ...

    "body": "To the editor: If Gov. Gavin Newsom leans on California's symbolic image during a potential presidential campaign, it risks backfiring (\"How can Newsom stay relevant? Become the new FDR,\" Nov. 9). While California's positions can be used to strategically highlight policy successes, its polarizing image can exacerbate alienation.\n\nAccording to a 2024 survey for the Los Angeles Times, 50% of adults nationwide believe California is in decline. 48% of Republicans believe the state is \"not really American.\" Despite Newsom's recent increase in the polls, leaning on California's symbolism is likely to continue alienating voters who view the state negatively.\n\nThe counterargument presented here by columnist Anita Chabria is that \"regular people hate despair, poverty and Nazis far more than they hate California.\" That over-simplification fails to address voter concerns on national issues.\n\nPopular or not, Newsom struggles to appeal to his critics. Rather than showcasing California as America's future, he should instead popularize his policy successes and advocate for uniform progress.\n\nTo the editor: I agree with columnist Mark Z. Barabak that affordability will be the key factor in the 2028 presidential election (\"Newsom prevailed on Proposition 50. But the White House is still a big reach,\" Nov. 9). I like Newsom, but as a Michigan native, I'm certain that the inevitable opposition campaign ads showing gas, grocery and home prices in California will evoke shock in most of the country. As governor for eight years, Newsom will be seen as responsible for it.\n\nTo win, whoever the Democratic candidate is will have to tie affordability to reducing inequality. This would include increasing income and estate taxes on the wealthy in order to fund child care, tuition, medical coverage and housing assistance, the key components of the affordability crisis.\n\nNewsom, who will be perceived as presiding over an unaffordable state, is simply the wrong messenger. It's too bad, because the right messenger will also need to project strength and Newsom certainly has that.\n\nTo the editor: Like Rodney Dangerfield, California just gets no respect. \"Far left,\" \"nutty,\" \"secular,\" \"permissive.\" Can we please dream up some new stereotypes? These are old, tired and worn out.\n\nAnd \"tax-happy\"? Now that's rich coming from non-Californians. In the fiscal year 2023-24, California paid $806 billion in federal taxes, the largest amount of any state. California is a \"donor state\" because it contributes more in federal taxes than it receives back in federal funding.\n\nAnd as for old, worn-out cliches, it's my turn: Ah, California, \"can't live with her, can't live without her.\" Or, put another way, \"don't bite the hand that feeds you.\"",

    "title": "Opinion | California's woes are many. Will any Democrat dare admit it in 2026?",
    "body": "California Gov. Gavin Newsom speaks to reporters in Stockton, California, on Oct. 22. (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)\n\nBill Whalen, the Hoover Institution's Virginia Hobbs Carpenter Distinguished Policy Fellow in Journalism, was chief speechwriter to former California governor Pete Wilson.\n\nAs tempting as it may be to view the New Jersey and Virginia gubernatorial votes as Democratic temperature checks, a more telling thermometer may exist farther west: the race to succeed a term limited Gov. Gavin Newsom in California.\n\nThis may seem odd given that the Golden State is arguably the most azure of America's \"blue\" states. Apart from Arnold Schwarzenegger, no Republican has won a California gubernatorial contest in more than three decades. The average Democratic margin of victory in the four post-Arnold races? Almost 19 points.\n\nYet, California's 2026 contest bears watching for two reasons: an uncharacteristically wide-open primary lacking a governor-in-waiting, which wasn't the case the last two times there was no incumbent on the ballot, and a bevy of Democratic hopefuls engaged in a balancing act of appealing to an electorate that believes the Golden State is on the wrong track while not holding their party at least partially responsible for that sour mood. (Democrats currently occupy all of California's statewide constitutional offices and enjoy supermajority control of both legislative chambers.)\n\nAbout the California field: To the extent that there was a front-runner after former vice president Kamala Harris took herself out of the running, it was former congresswoman Katie Porter. But her lead always rested on the political quicksand of simple name recognition from having competed in last year's U.S. Senate primary. It remains to be seen what damage she has suffered from recent bad press regarding her temperament.\n\nWho, then, to fill the void? At least three other Democrats -- all with flaws -- could jump in.\n\nSen. Alex Padilla may decide he wants to relocate to Sacramento, but he has little to show in the way of accomplishments since replacing Kamala Harris in Washington four years ago. (One September gubernatorial poll shows 7 percent support for California's senior U.S. senator.)\n\nClimate investor Tom Steyer, who starred in self-financed and brutally anti-Trump ads in support of Proposition 50 and a mid-decade redrawing of California's congressional map, suddenly became front and center on voters' streaming devices. (Some local Democrats critiqued Steyer's late involvement as self-serving.) But his political record is notable for its futility: more than $150 million wasted on a failed presidential bid in 2020.\n\nAnd there's Rick Caruso, the Los Angeles developer and billionaire who, judging from his social media feed, can't decide whether he wants to be the state's next governor or his city's next mayor. That Caruso was an 11th-hour party convert when he ran for mayor in 2022 is something his primary rivals will probably reference.\n\nThe gubernatorial primary isn't until June 2, which gives Democratic hopefuls about seven months to lay out policy agendas. But there's a catch: To land Newsom's current day job, those hopefuls have to work around a Newsom flaw -- his overpromising when applying for the same position.\n\nSeven years ago, on the precipice of succeeding the more centrist Jerry Brown, Newsom vowed to steer California hard to port. In his words: \"Guaranteed health care for all. A 'Marshall Plan' for affordable housing. A master plan for aging with dignity. A middle-class workforce strategy. A cradle-to-college promise for the next generation. An all-hands approach to ending child poverty.\"\n\nWith a year left in office, Newsom hasn't made good on that ambitious agenda. California's child poverty rate nearly tripled from 2021 to 2024. The goal of building 2.5 million homes by 2030 (downgraded from 3.5 million) won't be reached at the current pace. After expanding Medi-Cal (the state's Medicaid program) to include all Californians regardless of legal status, the latest state budget scaled back health care for undocumented immigrants -- a shift that speaks to the Golden State's fiscal woes and perhaps the governor's presidential ambitions.\n\nDoes this mean that, now that California has voted on the Trump referendum that was Proposition 50 and attention should turn back to conditions on the ground, a Golden State Democratic candidate might dare to disparage the governor's record? It would be a calculated risk -- calculating how to survive California's \"open\" primary, where the top two vote-getters advance to the general election regardless of party affiliation.\n\nDesigned to encourage candidates to reach out to the middle with a more centrist appeal, the opposite occurred in 2018's open primary when Newsom, well ahead in the polls, spent money attacking conservative John Cox to elevate the Republican to second place. By doing so, Newsom avoided a more competitive runoff against former Los Angeles mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, who is once again a gubernatorial candidate.\n\nBut in a field currently lacking a Democrat with the same standing that Newsom enjoyed seven years ago -- as lieutenant governor, he ramped up for higher office by championing successful ballot measures on gun control and marijuana legalization -- no Democrat is likely to approach his 33.7 percent share of the primary vote (Democrats account for more than 61 percent of the primary vote). Instead, each hopeful would have to figure out how to appeal to a California electorate among whom nearly 45 percent of registered voters identify as Democrat and 22.5 percent as independent.\n\nWill Democrats campaign across California as Newsom did in 2018, offering a menu of unattainable progressive ideals? Will a viable Democratic candidate dare to say that their party has contributed to California's woes, including chronic homelessness, educational inequality and fiscal recklessness?\n\nPerhaps the latter is only so much California dreaming. Still, in the state that's home to the country's entertainment capital, it would be nice to see a plot twist.",

    "title": "Trump Blasts Newsom as a 'Horrible Governor' After His Shutdown Deal Criticism: 'He's Gone Radical Left' | Video",
    "body": "\"If he ran the country like that, we would have an absolutely gonezo country,\" the president adds\n\nDonald Trump made it clear he was not a fan of Gavin Newsom, blasting the California politician as a \"horrible governor\" in a new interview.\n\nThe president laid into California's governor during Monday's Fox News sit-down with Laura Ingraham, where he was asked to respond to Newsom's criticism of the recent government shutdown compromise.\n\nAfter showing a clip of the governor accusing Democrat senators of rolling over and playing by the \"old set of rules\" to bring the government shut down to an end, Trump accused Newsom of going \"radical left\" with his beliefs.\n\n\"I knew Gavin for four years. I got along great with him. But he's gone radical left,\" Trump said. \"You know, he's building a train system from San Francisco to L.A. that's got about a 2,000 or 3,000% cost overrun. It's the worst thing I've [ever seen]. I've never seen anything like it.\"\n\nAs Trump went on, he criticized Newsom's response to the wildfires that ravaged Southern California earlier this year.\n\n\"They lost 25,000 houses. Do you know they haven't issued one building permit yet? These people are trying to rebuild their houses,\" Trump claimed. However, per the Rebuilding LA website run by the California government, more 984 permits have been issued in the City of Los Angeles and 780 permits have been issued in the greater County of Los Angeles.\n\nHe continued: \"He did something even worse than that. He's now taking a big section of [Pacific] Palisades or some area and he's going to build low-income housing where they used to have luxury housing ... his fire stuff is out of control.\"\n\nWhile Trump noted that he \"always liked [Newsom],\" he slammed the California Democrat as \"a horrible governor.\"\n\n\"If he ran the country like that, we would have an absolutely gonezo country,\" Trump added. \"This country would be gone. The fact is, if I weren't president, if Kamala [Harris] got in, you wouldn't have $20 trillion coming in, you'd have money leaving.\"\n\nAt this point, Trump transitioned away from his criticism of Newsom and focused on the country's welfare system, including SNAP benefits.\n\n\"SNAP is supposed to be if you are down and out,\" he lamented. \"That's what the purpose of it -- people walk in and they get it automatically now. So, the number is many times what it should be.\"\n\nWatch more from Trump's interview with Ingraham above.",

    "title": "The hottest meeting in Brazil",
    "body": "With help from Noah Baustin, Alex Nieves, Christa Marshall and Jennifer Yachnin\n\nRUNNING ON BRAZILIAN COFFEE: Gov. Gavin Newsom isn't even at the United Nations climate talks yet -- but he's already getting bombarded with meeting requests.\n\nNewsom kicked off his trip to Brazil 1,800 miles south of the Amazonian city of Belém that's hosting this year's international gathering, talking to Brazilian and American financiers at an investors' summit in São Paulo.\n\nHis first question from the Brazilian press on Monday: whether he would run for president (\"Nothing else matters but 2026 and taking back the House of Representatives,\" he said). Newsom couldn't walk halfway down a hallway without fielding a meeting request from CEOs and NGOs -- or a selfie request. One Brazilian picture-taker had him repeat the Portuguese word for \"Let's go\": \"Vamos.\"\n\nHis remarks to investors at the Milken Global Investors' Symposium sounded more like a campaign rally than a business speech.\n\n\"We have seen this complete reversal of so much of the progress that the Biden administration made,\" he said. \"What Trump is doing is unprecedented in American history. ... This should not be through the lens or prism of red, in American vernacular, versus blue.\"\n\nThen he held an hour-long round table with representatives from major investment funds, philanthropies, development banks and energy leaders, who he said pushed him to bolster economic ties in existing voluntary agreements with Brazilian governments.\n\nNewsom told POLITICO he and his team were getting a \"disproportionate number of calls\" to meet on the sidelines of the talks, where the U.S. government's delegation numbers zero (\"not even a note taker,\" Newsom said.)\n\n\"We're at peak influence because of the flatness of the surrounding terrain with the Trump administration and all the anxiety,\" Newsom said in an interview in São Paulo.\n\nNewsom is playing a well-rehearsed role for California, which has staked out a leading role in international climate diplomacy for decades under both Democratic and Republican governors, including during President Donald Trump's first term.\n\nThe Trump administration's dismantling of climate policies to favor oil and gas interests only give California more space to fill, said former Gov. Jerry Brown, who got a hero's welcome himself at the United Nations climate talks in 2017, the first year of Trump 1.0.\n\n\"Trump, he's saying one thing,\" Brown said in an interview. \"Newsom is saying something else, very important.\" The impact, he said, will be determined in Belém. \"That's why it's exciting. There's not an answer yet.\"\n\nThat gives Newsom an opening -- and a risk. Where Brown led a coalition of states eager to demonstrate continued commitment on climate in Trump's first term, Newsom will arrive in Belém, near the mouth of the Amazon River, at a time when U.S. politics are tilting rightward and even Democrats are pulling back on embracing climate policies.\n\nAnd there's little Newsom's team, which includes ex-State Department climate negotiators, can actually do in the closed-door talks reserved for countries. But the governor's goal is to influence from just outside the door.\n\n\"We're in every room, because California has been the inspiration for a lot of these jurisdictions,\" he told POLITICO.\n\nNewsom's heading next to Belém, where he's scheduled to meet with other subnational leaders and renew environmental pacts with other countries and states -- starting on Tuesday with the environment ministers from Germany and the German state of Baden-Württemburg, which Brown first partnered with to promote the soft power of subnational governments during Trump's first term. Newsom said he would also meet with representatives from Chile. He's also expected to give plenary remarks at the U.N.\n\nAfter that, he'll head deeper into the Amazon rainforest to meet with Indigenous communities on conservation -- one of the goals of the Brazilian organizers of the climate talks. Newsom said he saw the visit to the Amazon as a spiritual opportunity.\n\n\"It connects us to our creator,\" he said. \"It connects us to thousands and thousands of generations.\" -- CvK\n\nDid someone forward you this newsletter? Sign up here!\n\nNUCLEAR NEWSOM: California's only nuclear power plant hit a relicensing snag last week at the Coastal Commission. But Newsom signaled on Monday that he remains bullish on the at-times-controversial source of energy.\n\nThe Golden State governor said during a fireside chat with Milken Institute CEO Rich Ditizio in Brazil that nuclear power has \"entered the conversation\" in California and across the U.S. \"in a way that is surprising compared to where we were even five years ago.\"\n\n\"It's become more and more socialized, less weaponized, from the dynamic of being controversial now to being deeply part of our low carbon green growth strategy,\" Newsom said.\n\nHe reflected on his 2022 move to extend Diablo Canyon's operations to 2030, instead of allowing the plant to shutter.\n\n\"I thought it would end my term. My term was extended for 4 years,\" Newsom said (jokingly, he later clarified). \"I give you that as a political proof point -- turns out not to have been as consequential as I thought.\" -- Cvk, NB\n\nTICK TOCK: The Trump administration's deadline for state negotiators to land a Colorado River deal is here, but there's still no water sharing agreement on the table.\n\nScott Cameron, the Bureau of Reclamation's acting commissioner, set a Nov. 11 deadline for the seven states that share the river to hash out an initial deal, but there was little sign Monday that an agreement -- even one that is light on details -- is forthcoming, Jennifer Yachnin reports for POLITICO's E&E News.\n\nThat could put the Trump administration in the undesirable position of having to determine how to reduce water use by farmers and population centers across the West, a decision that would almost certainly trigger a Supreme Court fight.\n\nThe tensions spilled into public view last week, as Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs blamed Colorado, Utah, Wyoming and New Mexico for holding up progress, arguing those states were refusing to commit to reducing water use while demanding cutbacks from Arizona, California and Nevada. -- AN\n\nAI AND DRY: The U.S. data center boom could stress water supplies and spike carbon emissions through the end of the decade to the equivalent of adding 5 million to 10 million cars annually to U.S. roadways.\n\nThat's according to a peer-reviewed study published Monday, reports Christa Marshall for POLITICO's E&E News.\n\nAt the current rate of growth, U.S. data centers would add 24 million to 44 million metric tons of carbon dioxide annually to the atmosphere through the end of the decade, the study said. The build-out also is projected to drain 731 million to 1,125 million cubic meters of water per year, an amount equivalent to the household usage of 6 million to 10 million Americans.\n\nThe researchers developed an industry roadmap to lower its environmental impact by steering development to states like Texas, Nebraska, Montana and South Dakota that have low water stress and significant potential for low-carbon energy sources.\n\nWhile California has abundant renewable energy resources, the often-parched state has some of the worst water scarcity issues in the nation, according to the study.\n\nIn other data center news, Newsom was asked Monday about a report that two major Santa Clara data center developments have been sitting empty, awaiting hookups to the local utility grid. He mostly dodged.\n\n\"I'm very proud, I'm also very humbled by all of these challenges,\" Newsom said. He added that the state improved its permitting and procurement strategies last year because he is \"deeply mindful of the energy relationship to all this and where the energy is in terms of innovation and entrepreneurialism.\" -- CM, NB, CvK\n\nENERGY MOVES: A California legislative staffer is making the jump to a national energy business association.\n\nBrandon García is joining Advanced Energy United, which represents energy and technology companies including Sunrun, NRG and Microsoft, as its California policy director. García spent the last five years as a staffer in the California Legislature, most recently as the legislative director for Sen. Eloise Gómez Reyes. He'll be focused on advancing policies that strengthen the state's advanced energy industry, Advanced Energy United spokesperson Caroline Grace said in a statement. -- NB\n\n-- Deven Upadhyay, general manager of the nation's largest water district, discusses the challenges climate change poses to Southern California's aging water infrastructure.\n\n-- LA voters approved funding for an 8-mile bike path along the Los Angeles River nearly a decade ago, but construction still hasn't started.\n\n-- Salmon are swimming up the Klamath River again, and sparking a new fight to keep them out of farmers' canals.\n\nCALIFORNIA POLICY IS ALWAYS CHANGING: Know your next move.

    "body": "California Gov. Gavin Newsom can add a new line to his resume after this month's climate talks in Brazil: unofficial U.S. climate ambassador.\n\nThe Democrat -- one of President Donald Trump's most prominent critics (and internet trolls) -- is the highest-ranking official representing the U.S. at the United Nations climate conference in Belém. But he's not there on behalf of the U.S. government.\n\n\"The reason I'm here is the absence of leadership coming from the United States,\" Newsom said today during an investor's symposium in São Paulo that coincided with the climate gathering, reports Camille von Kaenel. \"This [leadership] vacuum is rather jaw dropping, not one representative -- not one, not even an observer, not someone taking notes -- that's going down to Belém.\"\n\nTrump, who signed an order on his first day in office to withdraw the United States from the international Paris climate accord, has snubbed the gathering in Brazil. The administration said the president will instead engage with countries directly on his energy priorities (i.e., boosting fossil fuels and tearing down global climate goals).\n\nThe U.S. is the second largest greenhouse gas polluter behind China and was once the most powerful broker in international climate agreements. This year, not a single delegate from the federal government registered for the event.\n\nAmerica's absence was eerily felt amid the conference's bustling delegation offices, often indicators of global wealth and influence in the international climate sphere, where heavyweights like China and the European Union held court, reports POLITICO's Karl Mathiesen from Belém.\n\nTrump officials aren't the only ones skipping this year's talks.\n\nSen. John Curtis (R-Utah), a mainstay of U.S. participation in previous years, is skipping the climate gathering this week because of the still-lingering government shutdown, while Senate Environment and Public Works ranking member Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), a serial attender, was unsure if he'd make the trip, according to my colleague Amelia Davidson.\n\nIt's unclear what impact the U.S. absence will have on the climate talks, which take place as countries continue to fall short of their pollution-cutting targets and as global temperatures are on track to be the second- or third-warmest in recorded history. Already, coalitions like the European Union are facing new responsibility to step up, while some world leaders have slammed the Trump administration as \"against mankind.\"\n\nWhile in Belém, Newsom will meet with Jochen Flasbarth, undersecretary in the German Ministry of Environmental Affairs, and Thekla Walker, the environment minister in the German state of Baden-Württemberg, POLITICO's Josh Groeneveld reports from Berlin. Baden-Württemberg and California co-founded the climate initiative Under2 Coalition in 2015.\n\nNewsom is not the first California governor to fill the U.S. seat at international climate talks when Washington interest wanes. His Democratic predecessor, Jerry Brown, got a warm greeting at the U.N. climate talks in 2017, during Trump's first term.\n\nSpeaking at the investors' conference Monday, Newsom said the U.S. is \"doubling down on stupid\" in an \"ideological war\" over climate. But he championed California as a \"stable and reliable\" partner for investors amid the country's larger backslide on its climate commitments.\n\nNewsom said California is cultivating market interest -- to fill a multitrillion-dollar gap in investment needed for the energy transition -- through free enterprise and predictable regulation. But he also promised to speed up permitting, an area that's hindered clean energy progress, where the governor acknowledged, \"We've gotten in our own way.\"\n\nIt's Monday -- thank you for tuning in to POLITICO's Power Switch.

The country is scrambling to solve a diplomatic dispute between Turkey and Australia, who both want to host the annual conference in 2026. If they don't find a resolution, Germany is obligated to step in under the rules of the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change.\n\nA trickle: Another 22 countries have submitted their overdue national climate plans, bringing the total to 86 out of the 195 parties to the Paris Agreement, Sara Schonhardt reports from Belém. Taken together, those new country-based climate targets would cut global climate pollution 12 percent by 2035 from 2019 levels -- still far below the 35 percent needed to meet the Paris goals.\n\nShutdown letdown\n\nFederal energy and environmental workers are outraged over a deal to end the shutdown that doesn't include extending health care subsidies, write Robin Bravender, Kevin Bogardus, Hannah Northey and Michael Doyle.\n\nEight Senate Democrats voted Sunday to advance a stopgap funding bill -- a move that also wasn't appreciated by their House colleagues. The deal includes the promise of a separate Senate floor vote on the health care subsidies, leaving federal employees wondering why they endured furloughs and layoffs in the longest-ever shutdown in U.S. history.\n\n\"My people are generally aghast at what has happened,\" said Nicole Cantello, a union leader who represents employees in EPA's Chicago regional office. If federal workers and the American people \"were going to suffer during the shutdown, they wanted to see more that was gotten for it than what's currently on the table.\"\n\nThe funding bill ensures that furloughed federal workers get back pay, forces the Trump administration to rehire employees it laid off during the shutdown and blocks more layoffs through Jan. 30.\n\nMission: Crush climate lawsuits\n\nAn attorney representing Exxon Mobil said defeating climate lawsuits against the oil company \"is a big priority not just for Exxon Mobil, but for the entire industry,\" Lesley Clark writes.\n\n\"I didn't just move my family to Texas from the East Coast to have a bunch of activists and ambitious politicians bankrupt the company,\" Justin Anderson, Exxon's assistant general counsel for litigation, said during the Federalist Society's National Lawyers Convention in Washington. \"We are not going to lose this fight.\"\n\nAnderson is representing Exxon Mobil in its third attempt to get the Supreme Court to toss lawsuits from states and localities seeking compensation for climate change. The high court has already rebuffed similar efforts twice this year. Now, Anderson said, the court needs to step in \"and decide once and for all that states are not empowered through their courts to regulate for the entire nation.\"\n\nBright spot: Houses with rooftop solar in Jamaica had electricity after Hurricane Melissa devastated the island's power grid.\n\nQuiet on climate: Democrats have mentioned climate change far less this year, instead talking about energy affordability and security, according to a Washington Post analysis.\n\nOops: A blade broke off a wind turbine in Plymouth, Massachusetts, and landed in a cranberry bog Friday.\n\nA showcase of some of our best subscriber content.\n\nThe impending shutdown deal is a stay of execution for the Interior Department employees whose jobs have been on the Trump administration's chopping block.\n\nNew Jersey Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill promised to freeze utility rates, but delivering on it will be a challenge.\n\nA new study maps how artificial intelligence data centers could spike carbon emissions and stress water supplies through the end of the decade.\n\nThat's it for today, folks!

    "title": "'We feel alone': L.A. fire survivors call for California's insurance chief Lara to resign",
    "body": "California Gov. Gavin Newsom is also facing pressure to oust Commissioner Ricardo Lara as insurance policyholders struggle with delayed and denied claims months after the Los Angeles fires.\n\nSurvivors of the deadly Los Angeles County fires, some of whom have been unable to rebuild because their insurance claims have been delayed or denied, are calling for California Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara to resign.\n\nLara, a former state lawmaker, has one year left in his second term.\n\nAlso see: California commissioner proposes insurance rule that critics call 'revenge'\n\nA recent New York Times article detailing loopholes the insurance industry could exploit in Lara's plan to try to improve California insurance availability was the last straw, fire survivors said. They said it proved Lara has helped the insurance industry more than he has helped policyholders.\n\nLara and others said his plan, which officially rolled out just days before the L.A.-area fires in January, is in its early stages and will take time to work.\n\nJill Spivack, a State Farm policyholder whose home burned in the Palisades Fire, said during a press conference Thursday that she has been unable to rebuild.\n\nAlso see: Mercury seeks new home insurance rates using California's risk modeling system\n\n\"We feel alone, we feel forgotten,\" she said. She implored Gov. Gavin Newsom to replace Lara. \"Californians deserve an insurance commissioner that protects families, not the insurers doing harm,\" Spivack said.\n\nLara -- who also faces accusations of improper spending of taxpayer dollars on travel -- told CalMatters in an interview that he has no plans to resign.\n\n\"I understand the anger (of fire victims),\" Lara said. \"I'm frustrated with the pace of recovery that involves multiple agencies, multiple levels of government.\"\n\nHe mentioned the actions he has taken in response, which include the Insurance Department's June launch of a formal investigation into State Farm over its handling of claims from the L.A.-area fires; a legal action against the FAIR Plan, the state's fire insurer of last resort; and a bulletin requiring insurance companies to fully investigate and pay smoke damage claims.\n\nLara's efforts aren't helping survivors quickly enough, some of them say. On a website the group recently launched calling for Lara's resignation, the Eaton Fire Survivors Network links to surveys that say 70% of policyholders face delays and denials, and that 61% expect to lose housing coverage within months. They want the investigations sped up. They want Lara to pause approvals of rate increases in the meantime.\n\nAndrew Wessels is still waiting to move back into his Altadena home, which did not burn down but was damaged. He first spoke with CalMatters in May, as he was battling State Farm over getting his home tested for toxins because he did not want to move his two children back into a potentially unhealthy environment.\n\nHe told CalMatters on Friday that he is still waiting for more tests the insurer ordered as it decides what it wants to pay for. He expects to have to wait until next year before he and his family can actually rebuild. But he feels lucky that he, his wife and kids found semi-permanent housing after shuffling among Airbnbs since the fire. They are now three months into an 18-month lease that State Farm is paying for, and he's breathing a little easier because he's \"not boxing up things every few weeks.\"\n\nHe is joining the call for Lara's resignation. He said the state's insurance department recently closed his complaint about State Farm's handling of his claims based on the company's word alone -- without asking him first.\n\n\"Recent information provided by the insurer states that the matter you originally brought to our attention is currently in stable condition,\" the department's Oct. 8 letter states.\n\n\"It was particularly concerning that it was closed without talking to me,\" Wessels said. \"They're supposed to represent me. I think it speaks to who the Department of Insurance actually serves.\"\n\nHe appealed and asked a couple of his state lawmakers' staff to contact the department on his behalf, and it reopened his complaint.\n\n\"It was also concerning that 'if State Farm says it, it must be true,' since the department is investigating (the insurer) for illegal practices,\" Wessels added. That proves a change is needed, he said.\n\nNewsom spokesperson Tara Gallegos and the governor's office did not return repeated requests for comment about the calls for the governor to replace Lara.\n\nNicole Ganley, a spokesperson for the American Property Casualty Insurance Association, said the industry group would have no comment on the effort to oust Lara. She pointed to a letter to the editor the group sent to the New York Times, which took issue with the story about insurers reportedly exploiting loopholes in the commissioner's new regulations by avoiding writing policies in certain areas, then turning around to request to raise their premiums anyway.\n\n\"The reforms are recent, and their impact is still unfolding,\" the letter says in part. \"Suggesting failure at this stage misrepresents the facts and risks undermining public confidence in a strategy designed to stabilize coverage in high-risk areas.\"\n\nCarmen Balber, executive director of Consumer Watchdog, the Los Angeles-based nonprofit organization that is often at odds with Lara, was also at the press conference. Throughout his tenure, her organization has questioned his insurance ties, beginning in 2019 when Lara received and returned campaign contributions from the industry. He ran for office pledging not to take money from companies he'd regulate.\n\nThe organization is also the main intervenor in insurance rate reviews, meaning it often submits challenges to insurers' proposed rate increases and changes. On Nov. 20, a public hearing is scheduled to discuss Lara's proposed changes to the intervenor process, which Consumer Watchdog has characterized as the commissioner's revenge.\n\n\"What we've seen happen over the past couple of years is things getting worse for consumers, not better,\" Balber told CalMatters ahead of the press conference. \"We need someone new in charge who will hold the industry accountable to its promises.\"\n\nBut Amy Bach, executive director of San Francisco-based consumer advocacy group United Policyholders, said she is \"sorry to see energy being expended in this direction.\"\n\nShe said there are legal, regulatory and other efforts underway to try to improve the state's home insurance market, and that bringing in a different commissioner isn't likely to speed things up. \"There is no magic wand that will solve the insurance challenges that are plaguing L.A. wildfire survivors and causing premiums to rise untenably across the state,\" Bach said.\n\nRobert Herrell, a former deputy insurance commissioner under Lara's predecessor, also used the magic-wand analogy. As climate disasters and risks proliferate, there is no easy fix to what ails property insurance in this state, nation and the rest of the world, he said.\n\nYet he said survivors need a strong commissioner who stands up to the insurance industry. \"This is not that commissioner,\" said Herrell, who is now executive director of the nonprofit advocacy group Consumer Federation of California. \"Just because he says that every time he takes action it's for the consumers doesn't make it true.\"\n\nBach said Lara has had to find a way to balance competing interests: \"No prior commissioner faced the marketplace conditions he's faced, so it's hard to say whether a heavier-handed approach would have worked any better than what he's trying to achieve.\"",

    "title": "Democrats Trade Election Euphoria for Angst Over Shutdown Deal",
    "body": "(Bloomberg) -- The decision by a group of Senate Democrats to vote to end the 41-day government shutdown -- after extracting no meaningful concessions from President Donald Trump -- has triggered outrage across much of the party.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom decried the move as \"a surrender,\" while Illinois Governor JB Pritzker dismissed it as an \"empty promise\" -- sentiments echoed across Capitol Hill and by party activists.\n\n\"Not a clue what they're thinking,\" said Amanda Litman, co-founder of the progressive nonprofit Run For Something, which has recruited thousands of people to run for office across the country. \"Truly idiotic from top to bottom.\"\n\nSome Democrats went beyond criticizing the deal itself to lambaste Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York, who was perceived as failing to keep his caucus in line in a showdown his party might have won. Progressive Representative Ro Khanna of California said on X that Schumer \"is no longer effective and should be replaced.\"\n\n\"If you can't lead the fight to stop healthcare premiums from skyrocketing for Americans, what will you fight for?\" Khanna added.\n\nSchumer said he would oppose the deal brokered by centrist members of his caucus with the Republican majority, but one of the moderates, Senator Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, said Schumer had been kept informed as they negotiated.\n\nAs the standoff dragged on, Democrats seemed to have some momentum, with polls showing most of the public blaming Republicans for the longest shutdown in US history and airline cancellations piling up nationwide as Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy ordered flight cancellations. In addition, the administration's decision to take its fight to withhold billions in food aid all the way to the Supreme Court was a risky political gambit.\n\nSome Democrats said last week's electoral victories showed that voters supported their shutdown fight. Trump himself even acknowledged the government closure hurt Republicans at the polls.\n\nBut the costs to key Democratic constituencies were also rising and the Trump administration showed little sign it was willing to consider the party's demands to extend health-care subsidies, even when Democrats offered to temper their proposal late last week.",

    "body": "California Gov. Gavin Newsom received a hero's welcome from fellow Democrats in Texas this weekend after his victory in the Proposition 50 referendum.\n\nThe California ballot initiative passed overwhelmingly, despite the fact that it ripped power away from the public and placed it back in the hands of politicians -- i.e. Democrats -- to redraw congressional districts and eliminate the Republican opposition.\n\nNewsom cast the vote in terms of national politics, telling Californians it was a way to push back against President Donald Trump, who remains unpopular in the state.\n\nHe also claimed his gerrymandering was a response to Texas Republicans, who redrew their own districts to comply with recent Supreme Court rulings that limited the use of race in district boundaries -- and eliminated five Democrat-held seats in the process.\n\nNewsom, seen until now -- even within his own party -- as a slick, entitled politician, can now claim to have done more than any other Democrat to level the playing field ahead of the crucial 2026 midterm elections.\n\nThat, in turn, places him in a unique position to make his case for the party's presidential nomination in 2028.\n\nNewsom excels in trolling Republicans -- which is why he hung around the GOP primary debates in 2023, and why he went to Texas this weekend to taunt the opposition.\n\nBut while he was gone, Californians continued to suffer the brunt of his policies.\n\nFire victims in Pacific Palisades and Altadena, for example, still endure endless delays -- both from insurance companies, which are reluctant to pay claims, and from local officials, who are dragging their feet in approving permits to rebuild.\n\nLocal residents, desperate for help, are calling for California Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara to resign, and demanding that Newsom ask him to step down.\n\nThe governor has yet to respond.\n\nHe is more concerned with what he calls the \"de facto\" end of the Trump presidency, which he promises will follow after the midterm elections.\n\nHow he hopes to convince Trump to approve $40 billion in requested federal fire aid after such antics is anyone's guess.\n\nThe state itself could help in any number of ways -- such as buying construction materials at discount bulk prices, which could lower costs for local families.\n\nIt could also develop long-term strategies to mitigate the danger of wildfires -- something Newsom has rejected in recent weeks, saying it would cost too much for a state that has struggled with budget deficits for the past two years.\n\nNewsom has other priorities: He spent $282.6 million of public money on the special election for Prop 50.\n\nMeanwhile, fuel is accumulating on public land -- like the land on which the Palisades Fire began, after being kindled from an earlier fire that state and local authorities failed to put out.\n\nNewsom is taking a calculated gamble: That Democratic Party primary voters will care more about how vigorously a candidate fought the Trump administration than how well he or she performed in office.\n\nFor the sake of his political future, he'd better be right.\n\nAfter nearly two terms in office as governor, following eight years as lieutenant governor and two terms as mayor of San Francisco, it is difficult to name a single real achievement in Newsom's long career.\n\nHe has simply failed upward.\n\nThe one thing Newsom has done well is to pick fights with Trump and with other Republicans, such as Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, usually over social issues.\n\nMost of the country disagrees with Newsom's far-left positions on issues like transgenderism, such as a state law punishing school districts that inform parents of children's gender changes.\n\nBut Newsom knows his party is desperate for a candidate who can fight -- even one who leaves his own state behind.",

    "body": "CARRY THE ZERO -- Gov. Gavin Newsom's turn in the center of California's ballot spotlight may not yet be done.\n\nBy the end of the campaign to pass Proposition 50, Newsom's ballot-measure committee was so flush with cash that he was returning millions of dollars to the Democratic-aligned House Majority PAC and telling his supporters to \"stop donating.\" But that could still leave Newsom with millions left in campaign funds earmarked for ballot-measure spending -- enough to shape debates over housing construction, taxes, insurance and tech regulation that are likely to be decided by voters next year.\n\nNewsom has \"a strong stake to have an impact on a California ballot campaign, although a fraction of what it often takes to win big contentious issues at the ballot box,\" said veteran ballot-measure consultant Ned Wigglesworth.\n\nNewsom's committee, which spent about $17 million last year to pass the Prop 1 mental-health funding measure, had close to $6 million on hand when Newsom began promoting plans to sell voters on a gerrymander via constitutional amendment. Over barely two months, Newsom raised more than $83 million from both big and small donors and spent approximately $85 million on advertising.\n\nThe governor held over some money to cure ballots or fight legal challenges -- like the one Republicans launched the day after the election -- but has not made any plans for a 2026 campaign, a spokesperson said.\n\nBut the money is parked in an account that can't legally be used for some of Newsom's other political priorities -- like, say, trips to South Carolina -- and thus leaves Newsom another lever of influence in what is shaping up to be one of the busiest, most significant slate of initiatives presented to voters in recent years.\n\nShould he choose to, there is no shortage of issues that Newsom could push over the finish line with his star power and resources. There's precedent for outgoing governors channeling their ballot accounts toward a capstone project: Near the end of his time in office, Gov. Jerry Brown funded Proposition 57 to undo the sentencing rules he'd enacted in his first go-around.\n\nNewsom's labor allies are attempting to qualify a series of initiatives aiming to cap hospital CEO pay, regulate health clinic spending, and extend a tax on incomes of $250,000 or more. A high-stakes insurance fight will likely play out at the ballot. Further reform on the state's landmark environmental law, CEQA, which Newsom took the first stab at during the most recent legislative session, could also end up before voters.\n\nAnd as Newsom prepares for a likely 2028 presidential run, he will have a political imperative to avoid haunting his campaign. Jim Steyer, the CEO of Common Sense Media, is attempting to qualify a measure that would regulate how young people use chatbots and prohibit companies from selling or sharing minors' data without consent, building off a bill that Newsom already vetoed (another potential line of attack for critics). He will have to navigate how an SEIU-UHW measure that would tax the state's billionaires would play in states like South Carolina.\n\n\"The governor has demonstrated the ability to raise huge dollars,\" said Wigglesworth, \"so another California measure could be in the cards.\" -- With help from Jeremy B. White.\n\nWelcome to Ballot Measure Weekly, a special edition of Playbook PM focused on California's lively realm of ballot-measure campaigns. Drop me a line at [email protected] or find me on X -- @wrmccart.\n\nA highly subjective ranking of the ballot measures -- past and future, certain and possible -- getting our attention this week.\n\n1. Voter ID (2026): The effort to qualify a ballot initiative that would require government-issued identification is continuing to cash in some significant checks, including $150,000 from Rep. Ken Calvert, a California Republican whose political future has been put in jeopardy by Prop 50's passage. Over the weekend, the campaign announced that they had gathered 500,000 signatures, more than half of the approximately 874,000 they'll need to earn a spot on the 2026 ballot.\n\n2. Scientific research bond (2026): A coalition is forming to fill the void left by federal cuts to scientific research funding. Supporters of the $23 billion bond, including state Sen. Scott Wiener and UAW members were planning to gather in San Francisco earlier in the day in the unofficial launch to their campaign to get the measure on the ballot via SB 607, a bill introduced in February.\n\n3. Independent redistricting (2026): Conservative attorney and author James Lacy has filed an initiative that would effectively repeal Proposition 50 after one election cycle and reimpose maps drawn by California's independent redistricting commission starting with the 2028 election. Although Lacy has hired staff, he has not yet secured coalition or fundraising commitments, telling Playbook \"if you build it, they will come.\"\n\n4. Bay Area transit tax (2026): A campaign to fund transit systems in the Bay Area is attempting to qualify its measure for the 2026 ballot via a citizen's initiative, which lowers the threshold for passage from two-thirds to a simple majority. Internal polling for the measure shows support hovering around 56 percent -- above a majority but below the two-thirds threshold.\n\n5. Measure A (Santa Clara County, 2025): A sales-tax increase approved in the South Bay last Tuesday is expected to generate more than $1.5 billion to keep county-owned hospitals running even after federal cuts, our Rachel Bluth reports. The measure had been watched closely by health officials around the state, and organizers in Los Angeles County, Alameda and other Bay Area counties are weighing similar proposals.\n\n6. Tax CEOs (San Francisco, 2026): San Francisco voters will have the chance to go after the vast resources of some of their wealthiest residents through two local measures likely to appear on the 2026 ballot. The measures, one led by county supervisors and the second by local progressive groups, both aim to raise money for the general fund.\n\n7. Top earner tax (2026): A CTA-led proposal to make permanent a tax on incomes over $250,000 has been cleared for circulation. Proponents will now have until early May to collect 874,000 signatures to qualify the measure for the 2026 ballot, and have already been seeded with an initial $5 million to launch the effort.\n\nFINAL STRETCH -- With an end to the government shutdown finally in sight, California Reps. Sam Liccardo, a Democrat, and Kevin Kiley, a Republican, introduced a bill today that would extend expiring Affordable Care Act tax credits for two years following a Senate vote on Sunday that advanced a key plan to break the shutdown stalemate, our reporters on the Hill write.\n\nThe legislation comes as many progressives in the Senate, as well as a large number of House Democrats, think that any deal that doesn't extend ACA credits isn't sufficient. Democratic leadership in the House has stressed that health subsidies be addressed in the bill over a handshake compromise.\n\nThe bipartisan bill from Liccardo and Kiley breaks with other similar legislation -- like Virginia Rep.

    "body": "Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass (D) and California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) need to \"get off their asses,\" EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said during a policy event with Breitbart News on Monday, discussing the aftermath of the devastating fire in the Palisades.\n\nDescribing the aftermath in the Palisades as \"apocalyptic,\" with over 13,000 buildings destroyed, Zeldin said his agency quickly jumped in to do their part.\n\n\"In record time this happened, the middle of January. [The] President was sworn in. A few days later, he signed an executive order. He wanted EPA to finish our Phase One hazardous material removal in 30 days, so that Army Corps can come in and do their Phase Two debris removal. The initial response was that was going to be impossible. You'll be lucky if you could get this done by the summer, and we got it done in Trump speed, and got it done in less than 30 days,\" Zeldin said, giving a big thank you to the EPA team and their staffers who were \"busting their tails to help the good people of Los Angeles who lost everything.\"\n\nWATCH -- Lee Zeldin: Trump's EPA 'Leaning into Innovation' Instead of Overregulation to Protect Environment:\n\nUltimately, he said their work was completed in that timeline, and the Army Corps has since completed Phase Two debris removal.\n\n\"So, as far as the federal government goes, we completed all of our work. Now this might be a little bit less politically correct,\" he said before tearing into local leaders.\n\n\"Karen Bass and Gavin Newsom need to get off of their asses and allow all of the people in Los Angeles to rebuild their freaking homes and their businesses,\" Zeldin said. \"You have people who are suffering extreme amount of frustration, anger, and pain because of whatever type of bureaucratic red tape delays. And incompetency is resulting in the local and state leadership preventing people from building what is theirs.\"\n\nZeldin emphasized that these people \"lost everything\" -- including their homes and their businesses -- and now they are stuck waiting and have no idea when it ends.\n\n\"It is incompetency, and for these people who live there who lost everything, the most important thing that you can give them is to instantly allow them to rebuild their lives, and you're denying them right now,\" he said, emphasizing that Bass and Newsom are \"denying the residents of Los Angeles the most basic need.\"\n\nMany people are \"still sitting there with contractors waiting for approvals from an incompetent mayor and an incompetent governor, and the rhetoric that we hear from Governor Newsom, where he's saying that President Trump is somehow the reason, the federal government, we have completed everything -- there is nothing left waiting for EPA sign off,\" the former congressman pointed out, making it clear that no one is waiting on the EPA.\n\n\"We stand with all the residents of Los Angeles who want to be able to rebuild, and they're just waiting for permission from their incompetent leadership, who are denying them the right to rebuild,\" he added.",

    "title": "America's AI future lies in the hands of California's governor",
    "body": "Gov. Gavin Newsom in October vetoed a well-intended but ill-conceived bill, Assembly Bill 1064, to regulate how minors interact with generative artificial intelligence platforms. But this welcome relief from a regulatory burden that would have been a massive hindrance to AI innovation has been accompanied by a flurry of California AI regulations that he recently signed into law. And given that Congress is seemingly unable or unwilling to act, for the time being it appears that the pace of AI innovation in the United States will be dictated by the whim of whomever wields the Golden State's governor's pen.\n\nAssembly Bill 1064, officially dubbed the Leading Ethical AI Development (LEAD) for Kids Act, was a response to a number of very troubling cases where AI chatbots appear to have led minors into disturbing conversations, sometimes with tragic outcomes. While there is no question that Large Language Model (LLM) chatbots have created new safety problems that need to be addressed, AB 1064 represented the sort of overly broad, knee-jerk regulatory response that could wipe out beneficial uses of a new technology in order to address a specific harm.\n\nAs Newsom correctly observed in his veto notice, the bill would have imposed \"such broad restrictions on conversational AI tools that it may unintentionally lead to a total ban on the use of these products by minors.\" He continued, \"We cannot prepare our youth for a future where AI is ubiquitous by preventing their use of these tools altogether.\"\n\nThis understanding of the collateral consequences of overly burdensome regulation, along with the expression of some welcome regulatory humility, contrasts with California's approach to regulating digital technologies generally. For all of his forbearance in vetoing AB 1064 and vetoing the even broader regulation of frontier AI models last year in Senate Bill 1047, Newsom and California's Legislature have enacted a tremendous number of smaller regulations that could collectively amount to the death of AI innovation by a thousand cuts.\n\nFor example, Newsom signed Senate Bill 243, a reduced but still potent regulation of minors' access to chatbots that includes mandatory age verification. This step will endanger both free speech and data security online for all users, not just children. Meanwhile, he signed a scaled-back but still problematic frontier AI model regulation in Senate Bill 53, which grants California regulatory agencies broad authority to unilaterally decide whether new AI products are safe. Further bills enacted by California this year regulate algorithmic pricing and generative AI content generation, each with problematic aspects that will nevertheless govern AI products nationwide.\n\nUltimately, what all these bills create is a scenario where all U.S. tech companies are de facto subject to California's laws unless federal law preempts them. The best-case scenario for investment and development of new technologies is that they are allowed to develop freely, with regulation stepping in to address specific, concrete risks that are discovered along the way. Instead, states like California are saddling AI innovation with broad precautionary regulations that will restrict uses of these promising technologies right out of the box.\n\nAt this point, the only way to guarantee that the \"California Effect\" doesn't hamstring U.S. technological competitiveness in AI is for Congress to finally do its job and pass a light-touch federal AI regulatory framework that preempts most state regulation of advanced computational technologies. Unfortunately, a serious attempt to pass a temporary moratorium on state AI regulations narrowly failed earlier this year, and the current state of gridlock on Capitol Hill makes the prospect of federal intervention seem increasingly dim.\n\nThus, for the foreseeable future, the pace of U.S. AI development and deployment -- and the very real race with China for cutting-edge AI supremacy -- will be decided by the California Legislature's voracious desire to regulate, checked only sometimes by the governor's veto pen.",

    "title": "Senate government shutdown deal leaves many Democrats furious, with little to show on health care after 40 days",
    "body": "Washington -- The decision by eight Democratic senators to embrace a deal to end the government shutdown has infuriated many members of the party, with critics saying the lawmakers abandoned the 40-day fight without serious concessions on the health care tax credits that were central to Democrats' demands.\n\n\"Pathetic,\" California Gov. Gavin Newsom said. \"There's no way to defend this,\" Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut argued. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, said \"it would be a policy and political disaster for the Democrats to cave.\"\n\nThe reaction is a reflection of the frustration among many Democrats, particularly progressives, who had urged their party to keep fighting after the strong Democratic performance in last week's elections. But the shutdown's ongoing toll was ultimately too steep for some of the party's more moderate members to stomach.\n\nThe resulting deal has exposed fault lines within the party that could reverberate over the months ahead and frame the party's internal debate heading into the primaries for next year's midterm elections. And it has led some congressional Democrats and progressive groups to call for Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer to step down, despite his personal opposition to the agreement.\n\nThe Democrats who broke ranks and voted to move forward had been engaged in bipartisan talks to find an off-ramp for several weeks. Led by Sens. Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire and Sen. Angus King of Maine, the deal they struck secured a vote next month on Affordable Care Act tax credits that Democrats have sought to extend.\n\nBut the agreement doesn't guarantee an outcome of the vote, and most Republicans have made no secret of their opposition to extending the subsidies. Even if some version of an extension does pass the Senate, House Speaker Mike Johnson has not committed to bringing it up in the House.\n\n\"I understand the frustration and obviously I didn't agree with that decision,\" Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii told reporters Monday. \"But what we have to make sure of now is that the health care fight lives outside of the appropriations process and doesn't depend entirely on the government being shut down. So now we have a fight in front of us.\"\n\nThe Senate Democrats who crossed the aisle have pointed to other provisions in the agreement to argue it was worthy of support. A new version of the funding bill would reverse all government layoffs that occurred during the shutdown and prevent them for a limited time going forward. The deal would also restore funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program at higher levels, and pave the way for a bipartisan appropriations process on other spending bills.\n\nThe eight Democrats also argued there is value in putting Republicans on the record with a vote on the health insurance issue, which Democrats have thrust into the spotlight with the shutdown fight. The moderates viewed the deal -- after Republicans leaders refused to budge -- as the best possible offer they could secure.\n\n\"We stood up to President Trump for 40 days,\" Shaheen said on \"CBS Mornings\" Monday.\n\nThe New Hampshire Democrat defended the move to cross the aisle despite the lack of tangible progress on health care, saying \"we're going to be able to continue fighting on that issue because of the agreement that we struck with the Senate majority.\"\n\n\"But we're also going to end the suffering of millions of Americans,\" she said, pointing to the millions of people who have not received food assistance, and the federal employees and air traffic controllers who have not received paychecks.\n\n\"And we're going to live to fight another day -- and that's what we need to keep people focused on,\" Shaheen said. \"It's not the Democrats who broke ranks who are the issue here.\"\n\nCritics are also directing ire at the party's leaders for allowing the defections. Almost immediately after the details of the deal came to light, Schumer faced calls for his replacement as the party's leader in the upper chamber.\n\n\"It's time for him to be replaced. He is not meeting the moment. He's out of touch with where the party's base is,\" Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California told CBS News.\n\n\"Tonight is another example of why we need new leadership. If [Schumer] were an effective leader, he would have united his caucus to vote 'No' tonight and hold the line on healthcare,\" wrote Rep. Seth Moulton of Massachusetts, a Democrat who is running for Senate.\n\nFor his part, Schumer outlined his own opposition to advancing the measure to fund the government Sunday, railing against Republicans for refusing to engage with Democrats on the health care issue during the shutdown while pledging to continue the fight.\n\n\"I must vote no -- this health care crisis is so severe, so urgent, so devastating for families back home that I cannot in good faith support this CR that fails to address the health care crisis,\" Schumer said on the Senate floor ahead of the vote.\n\nLate last week, Schumer said Democrats would reopen the government if Republicans agreed to a one-year extension of the health insurance tax credits. But Republicans swiftly rejected the offer.\n\nThe New York Democrat faced a windstorm of criticism during the last funding fight in March, when he voted to advance a GOP-led continuing resolution. This time around, Schumer made a point of putting up a fight, engaging early with Republicans and the White House to negotiate a deal on health care while keeping his caucus largely unified against the GOP's funding plan for almost two months. Still, since the beginning it appeared unlikely that the leader would make it out of the funding fight completely unscathed.",

Gavin Newsom as he runs for president should be New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani.\n\nActually, Mamdani should be emulated not only by Newsom but by Democrats running for office anywhere.\n\nNeither Newsom, of course, nor any candidate outside the most leftist burgs in America should wear the label \"democratic socialist,\" as Mamdani calls himself. That would frighten too many voters.\n\nBut what does appeal to voters -- and always has in America -- is a strong, positive message of hope. People like to think that a candidate understands their daily troubles and has a vision of how to make their lives better.\n\nMamdani is a 34-year-old Ugandan-born Muslim of Indian descent and a back-bench New York state assemblyman who the political experts would never figure to win a top-tier elective post such as New York mayor. But he has charisma, exudes authenticity and fills voters with hope.\n\nOK, some of his campaign promises are undeliverable, even in liberal New York: free bus service, free child care and city-run grocery stores. But I suspect many voters didn't take those pledges literally. It was the boldness and commitment to change for their betterment that drew people to him.\n\nIt's a message framework that has been a winner throughout history.\n\nFranklin D. Roosevelt promised \"a new deal for the American people\" and gave them hope with his radio fireside chats during the Great Depression.\n\nJohn F. Kennedy offered a \"new frontier.\" Barack Obama chanted, \"Yes we can\" and ran on a slogan of \"hope.\"\n\nThey were all Democrats. But Republican founder Abraham Lincoln urged Americans to \"vote yourself a farm and horses\" and promised them homesteads on the western frontier.\n\nRonald Reagan declared: \"Let's make America great again.\" Then Donald Trump stole the line and ruined it for any future candidate.\n\nNewsom's spiel has mostly been that Trump is lower than a worm. That has worked up until now. He has established himself as the Democrats' most aggressive combatant against Trumpism -- and the leader in early polling for the party's 2028 presidential nomination.\n\nLast week, his national party credentials were bolstered after orchestrating landslide voter approval of Proposition 50, aimed at countering Trump-coerced congressional redistricting in Texas and other red states.\n\nTrump is desperate for the GOP to retain its narrow majority in the House of Representatives during next year's midterm elections. But Proposition 50 gerrymandering could flip five California seats from Republican to Democrat -- perhaps helping Democrats capture House control. Newsom becomes a party hero.\n\n\"He's now a serious front-runner for the Democratic nomination,\" says Bob Shrum, a former Democratic consultant who is director of the Center for the Political Future at USC.\n\nPolitical strategist Mike Murphy, a former Republican turned independent, says \"the Democratic presidential race in '25 has been won by Gavin Newsom. He made a bet [on Proposition 50] and it paid off.\"\n\nBut Shrum, Murphy and other veteran politicos agree that Newsom at some point must change his script from predominantly anti-Trump to an appealing agenda for the future.\n\n\"He has to have an affordability message, for one,\" Shrum says. \"And he has to connect with voters. Voters just don't go down a list of issues. FDR, JFK, Obama, they all were very connected with voters.\"\n\nMurphy: \"He's going to have to expand from fighting Trump to talking about his vision for helping the middle class. I'd say, 'The era of Trump will soon be over. I have a way to bring back the American dream and here's how I'm going to do it.'\"\n\nEasier said than done, especially if you're the governor of troubled California.\n\n\"If it's about a referendum on California, he has a vulnerability,\" Murphy says. \"He can't run on 'California is great.'\"\n\nNewsom consistently brags that California is a pacesetter for the nation. But lots of Americans want nothing to do with our pacesetting.\n\n\"You can't have the highest unemployment, highest gas prices and the biggest homeless problem and tell Americans that everything in California is hunky-dory,\" says Republican consultant Rob Stutzman. \"Because voters don't believe that.\"\n\nBut Democratic consultant Bill Carrick, a South Carolina native, dismisses the effect of anti-California attitudes in Democratic presidential primaries.\n\n\"The notion that he can't win in the South and border states, that's nonsense,\" Carrick says. \"People who say that are Republicans. They don't like Newsom or any other Democrat. People who vote in primaries are hardcore Democrats.\"\n\nBut Carrick acknowledges that an anti-California bias could hurt Newsom in some states during a general election.\n\nHere's another takeaway from the elections: The Democratic Party is not in the toilet as far as it has been soul-searching since last November's presidential election.\n\nLast week, Democrats won everything from local commissioner to governor in much of the country. It confirmed my belief that the party's chief problem in 2024 was a lousy presidential effort.\n\nPresident Biden didn't withdraw early enough for the party to hold primaries that would have allowed its nominee to build wide support. And Kamala Harris simply lacked appeal and didn't inspire.\n\nDemocratic voter enthusiasm was contagious this time.\n\n\"There was one of the most exciting ground operations I've seen in a long time for 50,\" says Democratic strategist Gale Kaufman. \"Local party clubs, activists, union members all came together.\"\n\nDemocrats can thank Trump.\n\n\"Voters really don't trust Democrats but they're so angry with Trump it doesn't matter,\" says Dan Schnur, a political science instructor at USC and UC Berkeley.\n\nFinal takeaway: Trump has morphed into a Republican albatross.",

    "title": "Newsom blasts shutdown deal",
    "body": "NO MORE MR. NICE NEWSOM -- The Gavin Newsom of 2024, a loyal party soldier who stumped for Joe Biden until he dropped out, is gone.\n\nIn his place is the 2025 version, a governor more willing to break with (and openly pressure) fellow Democrats. A likely 2028 contender who split with his party on transgender athletes, pushed other blue states to redistrict and, on Sunday, called on Senate Democrats to swat down a proposal to reopen the federal government.\n\n\"Pathetic. This isn't a deal. It's a surrender. Don't bend the knee!\" Newsom's office wrote on X, referencing reporting that the proposal included none of the health care subsidies Democrats were seeking when the government shut down more than a month ago.\n\nHours later, a handful of Senate Democrats voted with Republicans to advance legislation geared at ending the shutdown after striking a deal in which GOP negotiators promised them a vote on Obamacare subsidy extensions in December, as Jordain Carney and Nicholas Wu reported. But many Democrats including House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (and California Sens. Alex Padilla and Adam Schiff) opposed the agreement because it omitted immediate approval of the health care funding. And Newsom shared a video in which Speaker Mike Johnson last week said he wasn't promising a vote on the subsidies by a certain date, casting doubt on whether Republicans would make good on their promise.\n\nWhile Newsom pushed Democrats on the shutdown, he is also trying to write his party's comeback story. \"The Democratic Party of old\" is no more, he told CNN's Jake Tapper on \"State of the Union,\" arguing that the success of his gerrymander in California is evidence of a Democratic resurgence.\n\nBIG PICTURE: If there is a Democratic resurgence unfolding, Newsom is working to keep himself at the leading edge of it. Elevating his platform outside of California, Newsom rallied Texas Democrats in Houston on Saturday before traveling to Brazil for United Nations climate talks.\n\nIn Texas ... Newsom pumped up the party base while urging Harris County Democrats to focus on the midterms, Faith Wardwell, Blake and Will McCarthy reported.\n\nMuch of the event danced around Newsom's highly speculated 2028 presidential run, with the governor pausing at one point in his speech as rally-goers shouted \"2028.\" Newsom only chuckled at the calls.\n\nBut other Texas Democratic leaders who took the microphone before Newsom used their speeches to hail the California governor's redistricting victory and nod to a potential 2028 run.\n\n\"I am here today because he is the future president of the United States of America,\" said Rep. Al Green (D-Texas).\n\nIn Brazil ... Newsom is about to take the stage as the highest-profile American official in attendance at the climate conference after the Trump administration opted not to send top leaders, reports Camille von Kaenel, who is trailing the governor during his trip.\n\nThe governor's task at the climate talks in Belém, Brazil, this week, she writes, isn't to negotiate sweeping policy changes or break into closed-door talks reserved for nations. It's to put on a show: proving his state is still cutting emissions despite President Donald Trump's rollbacks, nudging governments and businesses to do the same, and reminding the world that the U.S. might one day pick the climate agenda back up -- perhaps under a President Newsom.\n\n\"California is going to try to do our best to hold up a mirror to Trump's policies,\" Newsom told Camille in an interview ahead of the conference. \"We'll call out the fact that you can grow your economy and at the same time change the way you produce and consume energy. We have the receipts on that.\"\n\nReception ... Camille writes in from São Paulo that the climate world is hyping Newsom up ahead of his Monday appearance at an investors symposium. Milken Institute CEO Rich Ditizio told a crowd of American and Brazilian financiers at a Sunday night reception that \"the leading voices on climate in the United States are coming out of the great state of California.\" California Natural Resources Secretary Wade Crowfoot concurred, telling the investors \"you can depend on our leadership and consistency. This growing relationship between America, California and Brazil can continue to move forward regardless of current events.\"\n\nThe crowd seemed more enthused, though, by the presence of former Brazilian President Michel Temer -- and F1 enthusiasts for the Grand Prix race on Sunday were thicker on the ground in São Paulo than climate advocates. Still, the United Nations climate talks in the city of Belém, 1,800 miles to the north, are very present -- even at the São Paulo Museum of Art, where Camille toured an art exhibition on ecology timed to COP 30. Newsom is scheduled to speak at the conference Monday morning before heading to the formal U.N. talks in Belém.\n\nGOOD MORNING. Happy Monday.

In Brazil attending COP 30.\n\nNEXT TARGET -- The Senate is bracing for impact as Trump sets his sights set on Sen. Adam Schiff after securing the indictments of former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James, reports Hailey Fuchs.\n\nIf Schiff ends up indicted on allegations of mortgage fraud -- a charge he has vehemently denied -- or for any other claim, it would mark an unprecedented escalation for Trump to target an outspoken political adversary who is also a federal elected official.\n\nAs Schiff solicits dollars for a legal defense fund and builds an expansive political operation prepared to do damage control around any potential charges, Schiff's Democratic colleagues in Congress are increasingly anxious about their own vulnerability. They are also frustrated with the unwillingness of Republican senators to speak out on Schiff's behalf.\n\n\"I've spoken to a number of Republicans, and they are certainly disquieted, if not dismayed, by the increasing weaponization of the Department of Justice,\" said Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.). \"Because it tears down the norms and rule of law that protects them and all Americans, as well as Adam Schiff and Democrats who may be targeted by Trump.\"\n\nWhile his colleagues prepared ... Schiff continued to criticize the president on ABC's \"This Week\" Sunday. He said \"cruelty\" seems to be motivating the Trump administration's policies on food aid for needy Americans. (David Cohen has the writeup.)\n\nFIRST IN POLITICO: BREED MULLING BID -- Former San Francisco Mayor London Breed is considering running for Rep. Nancy Pelosi's seat following the former speaker's retirement announcement, she told Dustin. Breed has called allies, including Willie Brown, the former mayor and longtime city powerbroker, to vet the idea, according to two Breed allies familiar with her outreach in recent days and granted anonymity to describe it.\n\n\"I called a couple of people just to see what their thoughts were. My text messages and phone have been ringing off the hook from a lot of people in San Francisco,\" Breed said. \"It's important that San Franciscans have options. I want to explore whether I could potentially be one of those options.\"\n\nFIRST IN PLAYBOOK: CLINICS WEIGH IN -- The California Primary Care Association Advocates, which represents health clinics across the state, is endorsing former Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra in the governor's race.\n\n\"Secretary Becerra's commitment to underserved communities throughout his career will ensure that community health centers and clinics can advance our mission of minimizing barriers to health care access in California,\" CPCA Advocates President & CEO Francisco J. Silva said in a statement first shared with Playbook.\n\nFIRST IN PLAYBOOK: FRYDAY'S FRIENDS -- Former Sen. Barbara Boxer endorsed Newsom's chief service officer Josh Fryday in the lieutenant governor's race, saying in a statement he is a \"breath of fresh air\" who \"represents the best of the next generation of leadership in our state.\"\n\nAlso endorsing Fryday, according to his campaign, are former Rep. Lois Capps, state Sen. Melissa Hurtado, Anaheim Mayor Ashleigh Aitken, Riverside Mayor Patricia Lock Dawson, Stockton Mayor Christina Fugazi, Santa Ana Mayor Valerie Amezcua, Santa Barbara Supervisor Laura Capps, former Marin Supervisor Judy Arnold, former Novato Mayor Denise Athas, and former Walnut Creek Mayor and Bay Area Council Chair Kristina Lawson.\n\nDEMOCRATIC CASUALTY -- Democrat Christina Gagnier became the latest Democrat to drop out of a congressional race following the passage of Proposition 50, ending her bid for the now heavily Republican 40th District. The former Chino Valley school board member said she made the call after evaluating the new district lines and noted that \"resources are finite\" for Democrats trying to retake the House. The new 40th District spanning Orange and Riverside counties is now being fought over by incumbent Republican Reps. Young Kim and Ken Calvert.\n\nTECH EMBRACES CALIFORNIA RULES -- A sudden thaw between Big Tech and California politicians is poised to change how the industry deploys its lobbying muscle in state capitals and Washington, particularly as it tries to fend off hostile politicians in red states, write Brendan Bordelon and Tyler Katzenberger.\n\nAfter years of successfully fighting regulations in Washington -- and preventing California's tough approach to data privacy from spreading to the rest of the country -- the tech giants have largely embraced two new flagship tech laws signed by Newsom in September and October.\n\nWorried that tougher rules could cut into their businesses, tech giants now see California's approach to both issues as appealing national models, and hope to push them more widely.\n\nPORK PARTY -- California lawmakers slashed spending to address a budget deficit this year, but they still spent at least $415 million on local projects benefiting their districts -- and possibly their reelection campaigns. As CalMatters reports, the largest beneficiary was outgoing Senate leader Mike McGuire, who may run for a new congressional district created by Prop 50.\n\nGETTING THEIR GROOVE BACK -- Zohran Mamdani's win in the New York mayor's race has energized democratic socialists in Los Angeles, the Los Angeles Times reports. Organizers have begun discussing flipping the City Council to a socialist majority -- possibly by the end of 2028.\n\n-- Kenneth Mejia, Los Angeles' progressive city controller, is leaving the Democratic Party over foreign policy disagreements as he faces a primary challenge from the more moderate former state Sen. Isadore Hall. (Westside Current)\n\n-- California House Republicans' influence, already diminished after former Speaker Kevin McCarthy's ouster, is likely to shrink even more after the passage of Proposition 50. (CalMatters)\n\n-- Coachella Valley Republican leaders are blaming the state GOP for not raising more money to defeat Prop 50. (LA Times)\n\nPEOPLE MOVES -- Brandon Garcia is joining Advanced Energy United's California team as policy director. He was previously the legislative director for state Sen. Eloise Gómez Reyes.\n\n-- Kim Kardashian wrote on Instagram that she failed the California bar exam again but was \"so close\" to passing and will keep trying.\n\nBIRTHDAYS -- Jeremy Stoppelman ...

    "body": "Newsom kicked off his trip on Monday in São Paulo, where he told an investors summit hosted by the Milken Institute that the Trump administration was doing \"everything to vandalize California's leadership in this space, and they've been reasonably successful in nine and a half months to put a lot of sand in the gears. That said, we continue to persist, and we continue to thrive.\"\n\n\"The reason I'm here is the absence of leadership coming from the United States,\" he continued. \"There is a different picture that we can paint subnationally.\"\n\nIt's a well-rehearsed role for California, which has staked out a leading role in international climate diplomacy for decades under both Democratic and Republican governors. The Trump administration's dismantling of climate policies to favor oil and gas interests -- and planned absence from the Brazil talks -- only give California more space to fill, said former Gov. Jerry Brown, who got a hero's welcome himself at the United Nations climate talks in 2017, the first year of Trump's first term.\n\n\"Trump, he's saying one thing,\" Brown said in an interview. \"Newsom is saying something else, very important.\" The impact, he said, will be determined in Belém. \"That's why it's exciting. There's not an answer yet.\"\n\nThe conflict was already taking shape last week. At an energy conference in Greece, U.S. and Greek officials touted a new deal for Exxon Mobil to explore drilling in the Mediterranean, with U.S. Interior Department Secretary Doug Burgum saying, \"there is no energy transition, there is just energy addition.\" In Brazil, meanwhile, Colombian President Gustavo Petro called for an economy free of oil and natural gas during an opening speech to the climate talks, saying, \"Mr. Trump is against humankind.\"\n\nThat gives Newsom an opening -- and also presents a risk. Where Brown led a coalition of states eager to demonstrate continued commitment on climate in Trump's first term, Newsom will arrive in Belém, near the mouth of the Amazon River, at a time when U.S. politics are tilting rightward and even Democrats are pulling back on embracing climate policies.\n\nCalifornia's own claim to climate leadership has also lost some shine. Trump laid waste to its nation-leading vehicle emissions standards, getting Congress to overturn them in June, and state regulators have yet to propose making up the emissions losses. Other blue states were already getting cold feet about following California's rules, citing the cost of switching to electric vehicles and equipment. Newsom himself has backtracked on some policies, including a profit cap on refineries, an acknowledgment that high gas prices are a liability. And while the state has met its own emissions targets so far, it was off track to meet its 2045 carbon neutrality goal even before the federal government began attacking renewable energy.\n\nNewsom argues that Trump's policies are hurting competitiveness. \"China is sprinting ahead on clean energy to a scale and degree that I don't think most Americans fully appreciate, and I'm deeply worried about how they will outpace this country and how we may not be able to catch up,\" he said.\n\nAmid his feuding with Trump and the passage of a nationally watched gerrymandering campaign benefitting Democrats, Newsom's profile is soaring. He headlined a rally in Texas over the weekend and is rising on presidential primary shortlists.\n\nWhite House spokesperson Taylor Rogers declined to comment on Newsom's attendance at COP but pushed back on his embrace of low-carbon energy.\n\n\"President Trump will not allow the best interest of the American people to be jeopardized by the Green Energy Scam,\" she said in a statement. \"These Green Dreams are killing other countries, but will not kill ours thanks to President Trump's commonsense energy agenda!\"\n\nThere's little Newsom's team, which includes ex-State Department climate negotiators, can actually do to influence the closed-door talks reserved for countries. Instead, the team is focusing on expanding its list of voluntary bilateral or multilateral agreements with other subnational and national governments, some of which have been purely symbolic and some of which have led to research and policy exchanges. Among the most substantive are agreements with Chinese provinces, some dating back to Brown's time but which paved the way for Newsom to take a headline-generating trip to China focused on climate change in 2023.\n\nNow, amid his feuding with Trump and the passage of a nationally-watched gerrymandering campaign benefitting Democrats, Newsom's profile is soaring. He headlined a rally in Texas over the weekend and is rising on presidential primary shortlists.\n\nNewsom's agenda in Belém includes a first-ever meeting with Jochen Flasbarth, Germany's Secretary of Environment, Climate Action, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety, on Tuesday. The two are expected to discuss and renew a climate agreement their predecessors first signed in 2017. Newsom is also scheduled to meet with Thekla Walker, the environment minister for the German state of Baden-Württemberg, which in 2015 co-founded the Under 2 coalition with California for states and cities looking to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nHe's also expected to give plenary remarks at COP in Belém later this week, where top-tier global involvement is lacking. The Brazilian hosts billed this year's climate talks as a chance to turn lofty promises into results. But no sweeping agreement is on the table, and many countries are behind on their emissions goals.\n\nOnly a smattering of European leaders are in attendance, and the European Union's 27 member countries could not agree on a climate goal to present at the conference until mere days before its start -- and only after watering down existing pollution-cutting rules to get a deal. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, a former U.N. climate representative, stayed home. Also absent is Chinese President Xi Jinping, whose country tops the U.S. as the world's No. 1 greenhouse gas polluter but is also moving aggressively towards renewable electricity.\n\nThe Brazilian organizers have pivoted toward implementation -- focusing on things cities and states can do on their own, from forest protection to electric vehicles and disaster resilience. That will leave at least some in the crowd of government officials, NGOs and industry groups hungry for input from California, with its massive economy and Democratic-leaning population. Christiana Figueres, the former executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, named Newsom as the person she expected to generate the most chatter in Brazil.\n\n\"It is already predictable that, of course, Gavin Newsom will get quite a bit of media attention because he represents the huge state of California, but also because of his high-profile pushback on President Trump,\" she said in an interview.\n\nKen Alex, a former senior policy adviser to Brown who's traveled with him to several international climate talks, said climate diplomats know where to look for a stand-in from the United States under a Trump administration.\n\n\"Gov. Newsom is seeing the same thing we saw in the Brown administration,\" he said. \"Countries and other places in the world start reaching out to California because the U.S. is missing.\"",

    "body": "California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) has hurled yet again sharp criticism at President Donald Trump after the Democrats' recent election sweep.\n\nWhile speaking at a rally in Houston, Texas, on Saturday, the governor mocked his political foe as an \"invasive species\" while declaring that Trump had a \"very bad night\" on Nov. 4.\n\n\"We're dealing with an invasive species by the name of Donald Trump. He is a historic president, however ... [a] historically unpopular president,\" Newsom told the crowd.\n\n\"And he knows it. Why else? Why else did he make that call to your governor?\" Newsom continued, appearing to reference his defamation lawsuit against Fox News, in which he alleged that the network falsely claimed he lied about a conversation he had with Trump.\n\n\"Why else did he feel the need to rig the election before even one vote was cast? That's just weakness. Weakness masquerading as strength. That's Donald Trump. And he had a very bad night on Tuesday,\" Newsom added.\n\nNewsom and Trump have publicly traded blows on multiple occasions over their opposing policies and the deployment of troops in California among other issues.\n\nEarlier this month, Newsom torched Trump for being \"underwater\" in \"every key category\" as a world leader, including the economy, tariffs, immigration and health care.\n\n\"He's a guy that promised to make us wealthier and healthier,\" Newsom said of Trump's failed campaign promises on a Nov. 2 appearance on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\" \"We're poorer and sicker, across the board.\"\n\nHe added, \"People are starting to realize that not only is their coffee more expensive, their beef is more expensive, but the cost of an automobile is more expensive, since he became president, the cost of utilities.\"",

    "body": "Gov. Gavin Newsom, D-Calif., said that Democrats need to own up to ceding ground on the masculinity crisis facing men and boys and urged the party to take the issue seriously.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom, D-Calif., urged Democrats to \"own up\" to ceding ground on the masculinity crisis during an interview Sunday.\n\n\"I say this as a Democrat: We need to own up to the fact that we ceded that ground. We walked away from this crisis of men and boys. Trump saw it as an electoral opportunity to exploit it, but he's done nothing to deliver in terms of results to address those anxieties, which are real,\" he said during an interview on CNN's \"State of the Union.\"\n\nNewsom told CNN host Jake Tapper that suicide rates, dropout rates and suspension rates were off the charts for men.\n\n\"This is an issue our party needs to address. We can't afford, from an electoral perspective, to lose these folks. But we also can't on the basis of our values and what we claim to care about and represent, and I say that on behalf of women that need better men,\" he added.\n\nGOV. GAVIN NEWSOM REVEALS WHEN HE'LL START THINKING ABOUT A POTENTIAL 2028 RUN\n\nThe California governor pointed to Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk's work with the younger generation, and said he understood their \"grievance.\"\n\n\"Charlie was organizing around it. People weren't aware of what Turning Point USA was. I talked to so many Democrats who said, 'who's Charlie Kirk?' I said, 'Well, your son knows about him,'\" the governor said. Kirk was shot and killed at a campus event in September.\n\nDuring Newsom's podcast conversation with Kirk in March 2025, the pair found some common ground on biological male participation in women's sports.\n\nKirk asked Newsom, \"You, as the governor, should step out and say no. Would you do something like that? Would you say no men in female sports?\"\n\nOBAMA CALLS NEWSOM'S CALIFORNIA REDISTRICTING MOVE A 'RESPONSIBLE APPROACH' TO GOP TACTICS\n\n\"Well, I think it's an issue of fairness,\" Newsom replied. \"I completely agree with you on that. It's deeply unfair.\"\n\nNewsom told Tapper that Democrats had been slow to recognize the challenges facing men.\n\n\"It's a real issue. Democrats need to understand it not as a zero-sum issue, but an issue that defines not just our politics, but I think, defines our families, our relationships, defines the culture in this moment,\" Newsom added.",

He's quite literally running an extortion racket, and not just with universities like UCLA and others in California, but he's doing it with law firms. He's doing it to media organizations. He's doing it with some of the most well-heeled and powerful corporate leaders. You're seeing state capitalism, not just crony capitalism. What is the one thing everything has in common? The tariffs.

As we sit here, the Trump administration is fighting a court order to tell them to pay out full snap benefits. vice president jd vance called the judge's ruling that that the U.S. needs to pay, that the Trump administration needs to pay these SNAP benefits.

How do they, how do they honestly, how do you square the circle when you go to a prayer breakfast? How do you square the circle? I mean, Old Testament, New Testament, what's the fundamental thing that connects? From John to Matthew to Proverbs it's this notion of hunger feeding the poor, the sick, the tired, this it's not an option. It's central to advancing God's will. I mean, the fundamental point that we'll be using, because this is what it's about. The federal government said it in the lawsuit that they want to use it as a bargaining chip, a bargaining chip to end this shutdown. That's shameful. It's never happened in U.S. history.\"",

    "title": "California Republicans point fingers, search for change, answers after Prop. 50 defeat",
    "body": "Along the 215 Freeway from the Inland Empire's Murrieta to Riverside, opposition to California's Proposition 50 was evident last month.\n\nBanners urging a \"no\" vote hung from bridges in Menifee, while electronic billboards blasted digital ads in Perris. This is Riverside County, home to Sheriff Chad Bianco, a Republican and currently the leading candidate to replace Gov. Gavin Newsom in two years.\n\nHardly any support for the ballot measure, championed by state Democrats along with Newsom, was visible to freeway motorists.\n\nAny hopes that an anti-Prop. 50 fervor would convert into a ballot box revolution, however, turned out to be a mirage for Republicans. The ballot measure to redistrict California received overwhelming approval by voters and passed even in Bianco's county.\n\nThat stinging defeat has split state GOPers on the future of the party, according to reporting from my colleague Seema Mehta.\n\nSome have called for wholesale changes in leadership, others are asking for patience all while personal shots were directed at notable members, including former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger.\n\nLet's dive into some of her reporting.\n\nLeaders of the Republican-backed committees opposing the ballot measure were questioned about how they spent nearly $58 million in the special election after such a dismal outcome.\n\nFormer House Speaker Kevin McCarthy of Bakersfield, the once-prodigious Republican fundraiser, delivered a small fraction of the $100 million he vowed to raise for an opposition campaign.\n\nAssemblymember Carl DeMaio (R-San Diego) called on state GOP Chair Corrin Rankin to step down. He faulted other Republican leaders as well and longtime party operatives for their failure to defeat the measure, calling them \"derelict of duty and untrustworthy and incompetent.\"\n\nRankin pushed back against the criticism, saying the state party was the most active GOP force in the final stretch of the election.\n\nRaising $11 million during the final three weeks of the campaign, the party spent it on mailers, digital ads and text messages, as well as organizing phone banks and precinct walking, she said.\n\nBarring successful legal challenges, the new California congressional districts enacted under Proposition 50 will go into effect before the 2026 election.\n\nThe new district maps favor Democratic candidates and were crafted to unseat five Republican incumbents, which could erase Republicans' narrow edge in the House of Representatives.\n\nIf Democrats win control of the body, Trump's policy agenda will probably be stymied and the president and members of his administration could face multiple congressional investigations.\n\nSome Republicans lamented that Schwarzenegger was not more involved in the election.\n\nThe movie star championed the creation of the independent commission in 2010, his final year in office. He campaigned for the creation of similar bodies to fight partisan drawing of district lines across the nation after leaving office.\n\nShawn Steel, one of California's three representatives on the Republican National Committee, called Schwarzenegger \"a cowardly politician.\"\n\nSteel said that the former governor failed to follow through on the messages he repeatedly delivered about the importance of independent redistricting.\n\nSchwarzenegger's team pushed back at this criticism as misinformed.\n\n\"We were clear from the beginning that he was not going to be a part of the campaign and was going to speak his mind,\" said Daniel Ketchell, a spokesperson for the former governor. \"His message was very clear and nonpartisan. When one campaign couldn't even criticize gerrymandering in Texas, it was probably hard for voters to believe they actually cared about fairness.\"\n\nFor more on the splintering, check out the full article here.",

    "title": "Commentary: How can Newsom stay relevant? Become the new FDR",
    "body": "Proposition 50 has passed, and with it goes the warm spotlight of never-ending press coverage that aspiring presidential contender Gavin Newsom has enjoyed. What's an ambitious governor to do?\n\nMy vote? Take inspiration from President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who not only pulled America through the Depression, but rebuilt trust in democracy with a truly big-tent government that offered concrete benefits to a wide and diverse swath of society.\n\nIt's time to once again embrace the values -- inclusiveness, equity, dignity for all -- that too many Democrats have expeditiously dropped to appease MAGA.\n\nNot only did FDR make good on helping the average person, he put a sign on it (literally -- think of all those Work Projects Administration logos that still grace our manhole covers and sidewalks) to make sure everyone knew that big, bold government wasn't the problem, but the solution -- despite what rich men wanted the public to believe.\n\nAs he was sworn in for his second term (of four, take that President Trump!), FDR said he was \"determined to make every American citizen the subject of his country's interest and concern,\" because the \"test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much; it is whether we provide enough for those who have too little.\"\n\nRoosevelt created jobs paid for by government; he created Social Security; he created a coalition that improbably managed to include both Black Americans everywhere and white Southerners, northern industrialists and rural farmers. In the end, he created a United States where people could try, fail and have the helping hand to get back up again -- the real underpinning of the American dream.\n\nThe similarities between Roosevelt's day and now aren't perfect, but they share a shoe size. FDR took office in 1933, when the Great Depression was in full swing. Then, like now, right-wing authoritarianism was cuddled up with the oligarchs. Income inequality was undeniable (and worse, unemployment was around 25%) and daily life was just plain hard.\n\nThat discontent, then and now, led to political polarization as need sowed division, and leaders with selfish agendas channeled fear into anger and anger into power.\n\nLike then, the public today is desperate for security, and unselfish, service leadership -- not that of \"economic royalists,\" as FDR described them. He warned then, in words sadly timeless, that \"new kingdoms\" were being \"built upon concentration of control over material things.\"\n\n\"They created a new despotism and wrapped it in the robes of legal sanction,\" FDR said when accepting the presidential nomination for the second time.\n\n\"We're in a similar moment now,\" said New Deal expert Eric Rauchway, a distinguished professor of history at UC Davis.\n\nBut Roosevelt wasn't just fighting what was wrong, he pointed out. He \"wanted to show people that he was going to not put things back the way they were, but actually make things better.\"\n\nLike then, America today isn't just looking to overcome.\n\nDespite the relentless focus on cost of living, there is also hunger for a return to fairness. Even cowed by our personal needs, there is still in most of us that belief that Ronald Reagan articulated well: We aspire to be the \"shining city upon a hill ... teeming with people of all kinds living in harmony and peace.\"\n\nWashington, D.C., resident Sean Dunn distilled that sentiment for the modern moment recently, standing outside a courthouse after being found not guilty of a misdemeanor for throwing a turkey sandwich at an immigration officer.\n\n\"Every life matters, no matter where you came from, no matter how you got here, no matter how you identify,\" Dunn said. \"You have the right to live a life that is free.\"\n\nBut America needs to pay the bills and affordability is fairly the top concern for many. Voters want a concrete plan for personal financial stability -- like FDR offered with the New Deal -- grounded in tangible benefits such as healthcare, housing, jobs and affordable Thanksgiving turkeys that do not require lining up at a food bank.\n\nThe Republicans understand only part of this complicated mix -- the affordability angle. Though, like the robber barons of the Roaring '20s, MAGA elite are finding it increasingly difficult to dismantle government and strip the American people of their wealth while simultaneously pretending they care.\n\nTrump made a big to-do about the price of Walmart's Thanksgiving meal this year, about $40 to serve 10 people (though it comes with fewer items than last year, and mostly Walmart house brand instead of name brands).\n\nWalmart \"came out and they said Trump's Thanksgiving dinner, same things, is 25% less than Biden's,\" he said. \"But we just lost an election, they said, based on affordability.\"\n\nBillionaire-adjacent Vice President JD Vance summed up that Republican frustration on social media after Democrats won not just Proposition 50, but elections in New Jersey, Virginia and even Mississippi.\n\n\"We need to focus on the home front,\" Vance said, using weirdly coded right-wing nationalist language. \"We're going to keep on working to make a decent life affordable in this country, and that's the metric by which we'll ultimately be judged in 2026 and beyond.\"\n\nVance is partially right, but FDR ultimately succeeded because he understood that the stability of American democracy depends not just on paying the bills, but on equality and equity -- of everyone having a fair shake at paying them.\n\nDespite all the up-by-the-bootstraps rhetoric of our rich, the truth is healthy capitalist societies require \"automatic stabilizers,\" such as unemployment insurance, access to medical care and that Social Security FDR invented, said Teresa Ghilarducci, a professor of economics at the New School and another expert on the New Deal.\n\nLeft or right, Republican or Democrat, Americans want to know that they won't be left out in the cold, literally, if life deals them a bad hand.\n\nOf course, Newsom isn't president so all he can do is give us a vision of what that would look like, the way FDR did as governor of New York in the early years of the Great Depression, before moving to the Oval Office.\n\nThere's the evergreen refrain that as governor Newsom should stay in his lane and focus on the state, instead of his ambitions. To which I say, that's like shaking your fist at the rear of a bolting horse. Newsom is running for president like Secretariat for the Triple Crown. And since we do in fact need a president, why shouldn't he?\n\nNext is the equally tired, \"Republicans can't wait for him to run because everyone hates California. Wait until Newsom hits Iowa!\" But regular people hate despair, poverty and Nazis far more than they hate California. And the people who actually hate California more than they hate despair, poverty and Nazis are never going to vote for any Democrat.\n\nFor once, thanks to MAGA's fascination with California as the symbol of failure and evil, the Golden State is the perfect place to make an argument for a new vision of America, FDR-style. In fact, we already are.\n\nAt a time of increasing hunger in our country, California is one of a handful of states that provides no-questions-asked free school lunches to all children, a proven way to combat food insecurity.\n\nWith Trump not only destroying the scientific institutions that study and control environmental and health safety, California is setting its own standards to protect people and the planet.\n\nCalifornia has fought to expand access to affordable healthcare; stop the military on our streets and push back against masked police; and it leads our country in livable wages, safety nets, social equality and opportunities for social mobility. The state is doing as much as one state can to offer a new deal to solve old problems.\n\nWhat if Newsom built off those successes with plans for Day One executive orders? Expansion of trade apprenticeships into every high school? A pathway for \"Dreamers\" to become citizens?\n\nHow about an order requiring nonpartisan election maps? Or declaring firearm violence a public health emergency? Heck, I'd love an executive order releasing the Epstein files, which may be America's most bipartisan issue.\n\nBut, Rauchway warns, Newsom needs to be more like FDR and \"put a sign on it\" when he puts values into action.\n\n\"That investment has to be conspicuous, positive and very clear where it came from,\" he said.\n\nWe are not a nation of subtlety or patience.\n\nIf Newsom wants to stay relevant, he has to do more than fight against Trump. He needs to make all Americans believe he's fighting for them as FDR did -- loudly and boldly -- and that if he wins, they will, too, on Day One.",

    "title": "Commentary: Newsom prevailed on Proposition 50. But the White House is still a big reach",
    "body": "The road to the White House will only get more challenging from here on, in a way Newsom has never been tested.\n\nA week before California's special election, Gavin Newsom made news by doing something practically unheard of. He told donors to stop sending money to pass Proposition 50.\n\nIt was a man-bites-piranha moment -- a politician turning away campaign cash?!? -- and amounted to a victory lap by California's governor even as the balloting was still underway.\n\nOn Wednesday, less than 12 hours after the polls closed, Newsom sent another email. This one thanked backers for helping push the gerrymander measure to landslide approval -- and asked them to open their wallets back up.\n\n\"Please make a contribution,\" he pleaded, \"to help us continue to go on the offense and take the fight to Trump.\"\n\nOne campaign ended. Another seamlessly continued.\n\nThough he's been publicly coy, Newsom has been effectively running for president for the better part of a year, something even the most nearsighted observer can see. One envisions the restless governor, facing the end of his term, sitting in the Capitol and crossing days off his official calendar as he longingly gazes toward 2028.\n\nSetting aside its dubious merits, Proposition 50 was an unequivocal triumph for Newsom.\n\nHe took a risk that an esoteric subject -- congressional map-making -- could be turned into a heartfelt issue. He gambled that voters would overlook the cost of a special election -- close to $300 million -- and agree to hand back the line-drawing powers they seized from Sacramento insiders and politicians who put their own interests first. In doing so, he further raised his national profile and bulked up an already formidable fundraising base.\n\nNone of which makes Newsom's quest for the White House much more likely to succeed.\n\nHis biggest problem -- and there's no way to fix it -- is that he comes from California, which, to many around the country, reads as far left, nutty and badly off track. Or, less harshly, a place that's more secular, permissive and tax-happy than some middle-of-the-roaders are really comfortable with.\n\nTake it from a Republican strategist.\n\n\"He's obviously a talented politician,\" said Q. Whitfield Ayres, a GOP pollster with extensive campaign experience in Georgia and other presidential swing states. \"But if I were trying to paint a Democratic nominee as too liberal for the country, having the governor of California be the nominee would be an easy task ... Too coastal. Too dismissive of 'flyover' country. Too much like the elites on both coasts that [President] Trump has run so successfully against for years now.\"\n\nThat's not just a partisan perspective.\n\nThe Democratic desire to win in 2028 \"is very, very strong,\" said Charlie Cook, a campaign handicapper who has spent decades impartially analyzing state and national politics. The presidential contest \"will be determined by winning in purple states and purple counties and purple precincts,\" Cook said, in places such as central Pennsylvania, rural Wisconsin and Georgia, where issues play differently than within California's deeply blue borders.\n\n(Newsom's support for free healthcare for undocumented immigrants -- to name but one issue -- is an attack ad just waiting to be written.)\n\nFor many primary voters, Cook suggested, ideology and purity testing will yield to a more cold-eyed and pragmatic calculation: a candidate's perceived electability. He minimized Newsom's smashing Proposition 50 victory. \"He's got to impress people on the road,\" Cook said. \"Not just a home game in a state that's really tilted one way.\"\n\nFor what it's worth, Newsom should savor his Proposition 50 afterglow as long as he can. (On Saturday, the governor was in Texas, basking.) Because it won't last.\n\nAs Democratic strategist David Axelrod noted, \"the nature of presidential politics is the bar gets raised constantly.\" Once the race truly begins, Newsom will be probed and prodded in ways he hasn't experienced since his last physical exam, all in full public view.\n\n\"There is an army of opposition researchers, Republican and Democrat, who are going to scour every word he's spoken as a public official in California since his days as San Francisco mayor and every official action he's taken and not taken,\" said Axelrod, who helped steer Barack Obama to the White House. \"Who knows what they will yield and how he'll respond to that.\"\n\nAt the moment, Newsom is giving off a very strong Avenatti energy.\n\nFor those who've forgotten, celebrity attorney Michael Avenatti was seen for a time as the Democratic beau ideal, a brawler who could get under Trump's skin and take the fight to the president like few others could or would. He traveled to Iowa, New Hampshire, Florida and other states in a quasi-campaign before his extensive personal and financial troubles caught up with him. (Avenatti is currently residing in federal prison.)\n\nNewsom, of course, is vastly more qualified than the Los Angeles attorney ever was. But the political vibe -- and especially the governor's self-styled role as Trump-troller-in-chief -- is very similar.\n\nExit poll interviews in Virginia, New Jersey, New York and even California showed that economic concerns and, specifically, affordability were the main ingredient of Democrats' success Tuesday. Not Trump's egregious misconduct or fears for democracy, which was the grounding of the pro-Proposition 50 campaign.\n\n\"If you're talking about democracy over the dinner table, it's because you don't have to worry about the cost of food on the table,\" Axelrod said. \"If you have to worry about the cost of food on the table or your rent or your mortgage, insurance, electricity and all these things, you're thinking about that.\"\n\nTo stand any shot at winning his party's nomination, much less the White House, Newsom will have to build support beyond his fan base with a message showing he understands voters' day-to-day concerns and offers ways to improve their lives. Success will require more than passing a Democratic ballot measure in a Democratic state, or cracking wise on social media.\n\nBecause all those snarky memes and cheeky presidential put-downs won't seem so funny if JD Vance is inaugurated in January 2029.",

    "title": "Newsom appears onstage at Texas rally to celebrate Prop. 50 victory, take swipes at Trump",
    "body": "This is read by an automated voice. Please report any issues or inconsistencies here.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom strode onstage in Houston on Saturday to a cheering crowd of Texas Democrats, saying Proposition 50's victory in California on election day was a win for the nation and a firm repudiation of President Trump.\n\nNewsom possessed the air of a politician running for president at the boisterous rally, a possibility the California governor says he is considering -- and the location he chose was not happenstance.\n\nNewsom accused Trump of pressuring Texas Gov. Greg Abbott to rejigger the state's congressional districts with the goal of sending more Republicans to Congress, an action that triggered California's Proposition 50. Newsom successfully pushed for a special election on the ballot measure to counter the efforts in Texas, which the governor said wasan attempt by Trump and the Republicans to \"rig\" the 2026 midterm election.\n\nCheers erupted from the friendly, union-hall crowd when Newsom belittled Trump as an \"invasive species\" and a \"historically unpopular president.\"\n\n\"On every issue, on the economy, on terrorists, on immigration, on healthcare, [he's a] historically unpopular president, and he knows it, and he knows it,\" Newsom said. \"Why else did he make that call to your governor? Why else did he feel the need to rig the election before even one vote was cast? That's just weakness, weakness masquerading as strength. That's Donald Trump, and he had a very bad night on Tuesday.\"\n\nNewsom was the main political force behind Proposition 50, which California voters overwhelmingly approved in Tuesday's special election. The statewide ballot measure was an attempt to counter Trump's push to get Republican-led states, most notably Texas, to redraw their electoral maps to keep Democrats from gaining control of the U.S. House of Representatives in the 2026 midterms and upending his agenda. Newsom and California Democrats hope the change will net an additional five Democrats in California's congressional delegation, canceling out any gains in Texas.\n\nNewsom thanked Texas Democrats for putting up a fight against the redistricting effort in their state, saying it inspired an uprising.\n\n\"It's dawning on people, all across the United States of America, what's at stake,\" Newsom told the crowd. \"And you put a stake in the ground. People are showing up. I don't believe in crowns, thrones. No kings.\"\n\nNewsom's trip to Texas comes as the former San Francisco mayor has been openly flirting with a 2028 run for president. In a recent interview with \"CBS News Sunday Morning,\" Newsom was asked whether he would give \"serious thought\" after the 2026 midterms to a White House bid.\n\n\"Yeah, I'd be lying otherwise,\" Newsom replied. \"I'd just be lying. And I'm not -- I can't do that.\"\n\nIn July, Newsom flew to South Carolina, a state that traditionally hosts the South's first presidential primary. He said he wanted to help his party win back the U.S. House of Representatives in 2026. But South Carolina is a solidly conservative state and did not appear to have a single competitive race.\n\nDuring that trip, South Carolina Rep. James Clyburn, the highest-ranking Black member of Congress and renowned Democratic kingmaker, told The Times that Newsom would be \"a hell of a candidate.\" Newsom received similar praise -- and encouragement -- when he was introduced at the \"Take It Back\" rally in Houston.\n\nNewsom now heads to Belém, Brazil, where representatives from 200 nations are gathering to kick off the annual United Nations climate policy summit. For Newsom, it's a golden opportunity to appear on a world stage and sell himself and California as the antidote to Trump and his attacks on climate change policy.\n\nThe Trump administration this year canceled funding for major clean energy projects such as California's hydrogen hub and moved to revoke the state's long-held authority to set stricter vehicle emissions standards than the federal government.",

    "body": "Political analyst and attorney Katie Zacharia joins 'Fox News @ Night' to discuss the impact that Gov. Gavin Newsom's, D-Calif., Prop 50 will have on California and the possible precedent it could set for redistricting nationwide.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom in Texas on Saturday told a crowd that Democrats winning back the House of Representatives in 2026 is \"the whole thing.\"\n\nNewsom, 58, continued to ride high over the weekend, four days after California's Proposition 50 -- to redistrict the state's congressional map in favor of Democrats -- passed in a landslide.\n\nNewsom also couldn't resist taking a jab at his frequent foe, President Donald Trump.\n\n\"He is an historic president, however -- historically unpopular,\" he told the crowd in Houston. \"And he had a very bad night on Tuesday.\"\n\nOBAMA CALLS NEWSOM'S CALIFORNIA REDISTRICTING MOVE A 'RESPONSIBLE APPROACH' TO GOP TACTICS\n\nAlong with Prop 50 in California, Democrats also won gubernatorial races in New Jersey and Virginia and Democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani handily beat Democrat-turned-Independent candidate Andrew Cuomo in the New York City mayoral election.\n\nProposition 50 was a response to Texas' legislature redistricting their congressional map in favor of Republicans over the summer, and on Tuesday after Proposition 50 passed, Newsom called on other Democratic states to follow suit.\n\n\"We need to see other states, their remarkable leaders that have been doing remarkable things, meet this moment head-on as well,\" he said in a late-night news conference on Tuesday. \"We can de facto end Donald Trump's presidency as we know it, the minute Speaker Jeffries gets sworn in as speaker of the House of Representatives. It is all on the line.\"\n\nNEWSOM SET TO RALLY TEXAS DEMS WITH VICTORY LAP DAYS AFTER PROP 50 PASSES: 'CALIFORNIA STEPPED UP'\n\nHe continued his celebration on Saturday, telling the crowd: \"There were lines around the block two hours after polling had stopped because people wanted to be heard, not just seen, they wanted to send a message. But as I said, we cannot rest until we take it back.\"\n\nThe governor reiterated, \"There is no more important race in our lifetimes than the House of Representatives, and taking back the House and getting speaker [Hakeem] Jeffries sworn in next November. It's the whole thing. It's the whole thing.\"\n\n\"And so that starts today,\" he continued. \"It started on Tuesday.\"\n\nNewsom added, \"We can shape the future here in Texas. We can shape the future all across the South and across the United States of America. You have that power.\"\n\nTrump and the GOP have spearheaded an effort to pad the party's razor-thin House majority to keep control of the chamber in the 2026 midterms, when the party in power traditionally faces political headwinds and loses seats. Missouri, North Carolina, and Ohio have drawn new maps as part of the president's push.\n\nTrump is aiming to prevent what happened during his first term in the White House when Democrats reclaimed the House majority in the 2018 midterm elections.\n\nAlthough he hasn't announced his intentions to run for president, Newsom has been widely seen as a possible frontrunner for Democrats in the 2028 presidential election.\n\nCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nWhile two other Democratic blue state governors with likely national ambitions in 2028, JB Pritzker of Illinois and Wes Moore of Maryland, are mulling new maps in their states to create one or two more blue-leaning congressional districts, Newsom has been the most visible leader so far in the redistricting wars and the first Democrat to succeed.\n\nFox News' Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report.",

    "body": "It didn't take long after polls closed on Tuesday night for the special election to be called in favor of the redistricting ballot measure.\n\nIt took, perhaps, even less time for those on the Proposition 50 opposition side, largely state Republicans, to begin pointing fingers at who was to blame for their side's failure.\n\nAfter all, the side that vowed to fight Proposition 50 at the ballot box back in August, when Gov. Gavin Newsom kicked off the redistricting campaign, went into Election Day far outfunded and out-energized.\n\nCalifornia voters overwhelmingly backed Proposition 50, the effort meant to boost the number of Democratic-friendly congressional seats in California to offset similar mid-cycle efforts in other states to benefit Republicans.\n\nSince the election, criticisms have been lobbed at Corrin Rankin, who only just became chair of the California Republican Party in March; former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, who led one of the main opposition campaigns; former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, who only tepidly opposed Proposition 50; and the national Republican Party.\n\n\"The 'No' campaign suffered from a disadvantage that no amount of money could fix: A lack of recognizable leadership for people to rally around,\" said Andrew Clark, a Republican strategist in Orange County who was not actively involved with any of the campaigns against Proposition 50.\n\n\"Newsom and other high-profile elected Democrats stamped their name on Proposition 50, commanded big audiences and generated excitement,\" Clark said, adding, \"There was no equivalent on the 'No' side.\"\n\nThe California Republican Party has started an \"after-action review\" of the Proposition 50 campaign \"to measure what worked and what we will improve\" going into the 2026 midterms, said spokesperson Matt Shupe.\n\nConversations with California Republicans and political experts in the days since the election was called suggest the opposition's failure in the election simply boils down to two things: money and messaging.\n\nWhen it comes to finances, California Republicans were already starting at a disadvantage.\n\n\"There is no trove of deep-pocketed money in California on the Republican side to offset all of the public employee unions, private unions, business people who get money from doing business with the state of California,\" said Jon Fleischman, a longtime political strategist and former executive director of the state's GOP.\n\nThe only real way for Republicans to have competed in the Proposition 50 election, Fleischman said, was with a massive investment from national Republicans like House Speaker Mike Johnson.\n\nBut that's a tricky gamble.\n\nSpending that kind of money now, on hardly a surefire thing in California, takes resources away from other 2026 midterm campaigns around the country. National Republicans may consider, Fleischman said, that the path to maintaining a majority in Congress no longer involves California.\n\n\"It would have involved a massive investment to get in the hunt, and that doesn't mean you win. That just means every Republican knows there's an election,\" Fleischman said.\n\nAs James Blair, the White House deputy chief of staff, put it, President Donald Trump's operation has to be \"a bit brutal\" in where it spends its money.\n\n\"There was some money spent and supported, but you do have to be a little bit brutal in your allocation of resources,\" Blair, the political director for Trump's 2024 campaign, said on a recent episode of \"The Conversation\" podcast. \"Even though we have lots of money, we're going to allocate it well.\"\n\nIn contrast, Newsom had a highly unusual message for backers of Proposition 50 the week before Election Day: Keep your money, he said. \"We've raised enough money to win this campaign.\"\n\nThe Yes on 50 campaign has raised more than $114 million this year, according to the latest filings with the secretary of state's office. It also had some $37 million on hand left to spend.\n\nIn comparison, the anti-Prop. 50 Stop Sacramento's Power Grab campaign raised nearly $11 million this year and had about $2 million left to spend. This was led by McCarthy, who pledged early on to raise $100 million for the effort.\n\nAnother camp opposing the redistricting measure, called Protect Voters First, raised nearly $33 million and had about $336,000 still on hand.\n\nThe final ad from the Yes on 50 camp featured Newsom, along with several Democratic heavyweights, including former President Barack Obama, New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, to name a few.\n\nWhat it didn't include: A single mention of the term \"redistricting.\"\n\n\"Newsom and his team were savvy enough to know that educating voters about an arcane topic like redistricting wasn't going to happen,\" said Dan Schnur, who teaches political messaging at USC and UC Berkeley.\n\n\"Once they made the strategic decision to recast the initiative as purely anti-Trump, they set themselves up with a huge advantage in a deep-blue state like this one,\" Schnur said.\n\nDemocrats leaned into the narrative that Proposition 50 was a referendum on Trump and his policies, an effort to save democracy and protect access to reproductive health care and rights for immigrants.\n\nAlthough she thinks that messaging is dishonest, once an issue becomes nationalized, Republicans lose, said Roxanne Hoge, chair of the Republican Party of Los Angeles County.\n\n\"If it had been presented honestly as, 'Hey, we're going to burn down the village in order to save it,' we would have won,\" Hoge said, referring to the doing away of congressional maps drawn by an independent commission in favor of the partisan ones.\n\nCalifornia Republicans, going into their annual convention in September, were almost giddy about the redistricting fight, calling it a gift for momentum and unity.\n\nAnd early polling suggested Californians weren't all that on board with redistricting. In mid-August, only 48% of people surveyed said they supported Proposition 50. By mid-September, that only increased to 51%.\n\n\"That's a pretty precarious place to be,\" said Schnur. \"It only moved to a landslide when the opposition stopped spending.\"\n\n\"There's a very plausible case to be made that Republicans are better off saving $100 million for contested House races around the country next election rather than gambling it on an all-or-nothing ballot measure in a deep-blue state,\" Schnur said. \"But given how close to 50% the polls were still showing the initiative at even in mid-October, it suggests a more even fundraising might have been able to beat it.\"\n\n\"Republicans may look back and wonder if they had raised the kind of money they had committed from the onset, if they could have defeated it.\"\n\nThat's certainly a frustration expressed already by Assemblymember Carl DeMaio, R-San Diego.\n\nDuring a Zoom call the day after the election with supporters of his Reform California grassroots organization, DeMaio said his party failed to defeat Proposition 50 because the Republican National Committee gave \"token money\" to the fight and \"abandoned\" California Republicans. He also ripped into GOP leaders at the state level, calling the California Republican Party \"completely inept\" and calling for Rankin to step down from the helm.\n\nThe state legislator said he wanted a full accounting from the California GOP, including how many phone calls they made and doors they knocked on to reach voters, how much money they spent campaigning and who profited from the campaign. DeMaio also noted in an interview that there were reports of Republicans still receiving campaign mailers from the California Republican Party after Election Day, raising questions again about whether the campaign was managed well.\n\nHe also criticized Schwarzenegger, who spoke out against the ballot measure during an event at USC in September and again during a talk with students at Chapman University late last month. But Schwarzenegger - who championed independent redistricting and was governor when Californians voted to have independent redistricting commissions draw state legislative and congressional maps - did not actively campaign against Proposition 50.\n\n\"You can't be wishy-washy or half-in on a fight like this. Either go all in, or you sit to the side,\" DeMaio said.\n\nThe Assembly member wasn't alone in his criticism of the former governor. Shawn Steel, a member of the Republican National Committee, said Schwarzenegger \"never showed up ... was not helpful anywhere.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the former governor could not immediately be reached for comment. But in a statement to the Los Angeles Times, Schwarzenegger's team said he was clear from the get-go that he was not going to be a part of the opposition campaign.\n\n\"His message was very clear and nonpartisan,\" said Daniel Ketchall. \"When one campaign couldn't even criticize gerrymandering in Texas, it was probably hard for voters to believe they actually cared about fairness.\"\n\nFor DeMaio, it all boiled down to messaging. He believes more voters could have been persuaded to choose no on Proposition 50.\n\n\"We needed to simplify the moral question: Why is it wrong for California to rig its election if Texas is already doing it? That question went unanswered in all of the ads,\" DeMaio said.\n\nDuring a post-election press conference, Rankin defended the work of her organization, saying it raised and spent $11 million to try to defeat Proposition 50 during the last three weeks of the election. The state party had a \"robust\" mail program, sending out about 10 mailers, and spent millions on digital ads and text-messaging campaigns, she said.\n\nShe also credited central committees statewide for phone banking and door-knocking every weekend.\n\n\"We left it all on the field. We were the last man standing ... to reach out to Republicans and make sure they turned out. And I think we did an excellent job,\" Rankin said.\n\n\"We worked as a team. And we are 100% united,\" she said.\n\nAnd Steel, too, said he was thankful for some later support from the national party.\n\n\"At the end of the day, it was not enough, and it was late,\" said Steel. \"But I'm grateful for those who trusted us and gave us a chance,\" he said.\n\nIn the meantime, the California Republican Party has filed a lawsuit challenging Proposition 50 and is committed to a review to reflect on the election and lessons learned.\n\n\"There's no doubt we're the first choice of California's rural voters, and will continue to be. Yet, that's not enough,\" said Shupe, a Republican political consultant and spokesperson for the state party. \"California is the least rural state in America. We have to be a party that's big enough and strong enough to be the party of choice in suburban California and for our cities that are suffering under Democrats.\"\n\n\"We are reimagining and recreating a California Republican Party that doesn't just speak to the districts we hold, but those we want to win,\" he added.",

    "body": "The president got a serious case of the sleepies while Dr. Oz rambled on about how Americans are too fat.\n\nHey, we all tend to doze off while listening to the asinine jabberings of a daytime talk show host like Dr. Mehmet Oz.\n\nBut when you make that daytime talk show host the U.S. Administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and he's speaking to reporters in the Oval Office, falling asleep isn't the best look.\n\nAnd Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) highlighted exactly that in his latest troll post aimed at President Donald Trump.\n\nOn Thursday, Trump was seen with his eyes shut at several points during his administration's announcement about lowered prices for certain weight loss drugs for Medicare and Medicaid recipients. In a moment, caught by CSPAN, Trump can be seen struggling to fight off the Sandman while listening to Oz spout off fatphobic rhetoric 25 minutes into the White House event.\n\nBut, just in case one needs more proof of how sleepy Trump was, here he is fully snoozing in a photo caught by Getty photojournalist Andrew Harnik.\n\nAnd another one:\n\nAnd another one where Trump was trying his darndest to stave off the sleepies.\n\nIn response to Trump's naptime antics at the event, Newsom's press office decided to revive a nickname he had used for the president in the past.\n\n\"DOZY DON IS BACK!\" the account wrote, alongside a photo from Harnik and a snippet of CSPAN's footage.\n\nNeesom has used the moniker -- which is presumably a play on Trump's nickname \"Sleepy Joe\" for former President Joe Biden -- in the past, notably when Trump struggled to keep his eyes open during a White House roundtable on antifa last month. Yet, social media users widely used the nickname \"Sleepy Don\" when Dr. Oz seemed to put Trump into a catatonic state during a \"Making Health Technology Great Again\" event at the White House in July.\n\nAnd to nail down how out of it Trump appeared at the White House Thursday, not long after he knocked off during Dr. Oz's speech, he reacted like this when a guest at the meeting fainted. (It should be noted that White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that the man was OK, and he was a representative of one of the health care companies in attendance.)\n\nOr you can watch the whole incident unfold in the video below:",

    "title": "A potential shift in California's homelessness strategy?",
    "body": "When Gov. Gavin Newsom vetoed a bill last month that would have supported sober homeless housing, his reason left many scratching their heads.\n\nNewsom said Assembly Bill 255, which would have allowed cities to use up to 10% of their state funds to pay for \"recovery housing,\" was unnecessary. That's because using state funds for sober housing is already allowed, the governor said. He said \"recent guidance\" makes that clear.\n\nThat was a big surprise to Assemblymember Matt Haney (D-San Francisco), who had spent the last two years working on the bill Newsom was now saying had been moot all along. Haney had been under the impression that California's \"housing first\" rule -- which dictates that homelessness programs offer housing to people regardless of their sobriety, mental health, employment, etc. -- meant sober housing wasn't eligible for state funds.\n\nWhen CalMatters asked about the \"recent guidance\" that allows the state to fund sober housing, the governor's office sent a link to a 20-page document. No one CalMatters spoke to had ever seen that document before. Neither had Haney, anyone in his office, or the other stakeholders involved in his bill, including the service providers trying to build more sober housing, he said.\n\nWhile the document was dated July 2025, it wasn't published online until Oct. 2 -- the day after Newsom's veto.\n\n\"I think it's a terrible bureaucratic failure,\" Haney said of the lack of communication. Having the state and the Legislature work together, rather than on separate parallel policies, would have saved everyone time and resources, he said.\n\n\"Why didn't anybody say anything over the course of two years,\" Haney asked, \"not just to me, but to the cities, counties and providers who desperately wanted to open these beds?\"\n\nThe California Interagency Council on Homelessness, which has been working on the document since late 2024, put the blame on Haney's office for not reaching out. A preliminary draft was publicly available earlier this year as part of a February council meeting, said Executive Officer Meghan Marshall.\n\nThe new sober housing guidelines come at a time when the state is facing political pressure from some facets to shift its approach to homeless housing -- both to embrace drug-free housing and to turn at least some of its focus from permanent housing that accepts everyone to temporary shelter that may come with strings attached.\n\nA group of legislators, city housing staffers and nonprofits recently took a trip to San Antonio to tour a massive homeless shelter there, and returned with ideas on how to beef up California's shelter capacity -- which some on the trip say has been neglected as a casualty of California's strict preference for long-term housing. Meanwhile, President Trump's administration has signaled that it will shift federal money away from permanent housing and into temporary shelter, while also imposing conditions such as sobriety. California might have to get on board with that agenda, or risk losing federal funds.\n\nWhile few California Democrats are supportive of anything Trump does, the continued prevalence of encampments on the streets has convinced some that the state should change its tactics.\n\n\"We need to break the logjam of the dogma that says that only permanent housing is acceptable,\" said Sen. Catherine Blakespear, a Democrat from Encinitas. \"Because what we're de facto saying is that people are going to stay on the streets until we've built enough permanent housing or market-rate housing, and neither is on track to meet the need anywhere in the near term.\"\n\nBut that push has some service providers worried that, in an environment where homelessness funding keeps getting cut, focusing on sober housing and temporary housing will mean less money for the permanent housing that ends people's homelessness.\n\n\"The current trend shifts away from solving the actual lack of a home and focuses on some people's associated issues,\" said Jennifer Loving, chief executive of Destination Home.\n\nThe debate over sober, temporary or permanent housing doesn't address the underlying income inequality that causes many Californians to lose housing in the first place and prevents their being able to afford housing afterward.\n\nCalifornia has required state-funded homeless housing be \"housing first\" since 2016, meaning it gets people into a permanent home as quickly as possible without forcing them to jump through additional hoops. The idea is that once someone is safely housed, it becomes much easier for them to get sober, find a job or take care of other issues.\n\nHaney argues the model prevented the state from funding sober housing, which he said could be lifesaving for people who are overcoming an addiction and don't want to live next to neighbors using drugs.\n\nThe new state guidance says sober housing can be housing first, if it's done right. It must be the client's choice to get sober and live in recovery housing, and they must have other local options that don't require sobriety. In addition, sober housing providers can't evict someone for relapsing. If a client decides they no longer want to live in sober housing, the provider must connect them to another housing option.\n\nThe guidance is more permissive than Haney's bill. While the bill would have capped state funding on sober housing at 10%, the state guidance has no limit. But Haney worries it's too strict in other ways. If housing providers can't evict someone for using drugs or alcohol, they can't run effective sober housing, Haney said.\n\n\"There are some questions as to whether anyone is actually going to step up and do this under the guidelines as written,\" he said.\n\nThe state guidelines come with no money to open new sober housing beds.\n\nWithout extra funding, as more money goes to sober housing, that means less money for low-barrier housing, said Loving, who worries that shift will move the state backward. Sober housing and drug testing were the norm in the 1980s and 1990s, but people still overdosed in those environments, she said.\n\n\"Drugs were always present, even in sober living environments,\" Loving said. \"And that did not increase our housing outcomes. What increased our housing outcomes was the availability of actual houses for people to transition into.\"\n\nSeveral dozen California legislators, city housing workers and nonprofit providers traveled to Texas last month to visit a massive homeless shelter in San Antonio. Haven for Hope fits about 1,500 people on one 22-acre campus -- meaning that almost anyone in the city who wants to can sleep indoors. Most of those people are required to stay sober in order to keep their spot, and healthcare, counseling and other services are offered on site.\n\nThat program is a sharp contrast from the \"discouraging results\" of California's homelessness strategy, said Sen. Dave Cortese, a Democrat from San José who went on the trip. He's frustrated with what he sees as California's neglect of temporary shelter. New programs such as Newsom's Homekey only fund permanent housing. So did the Measure A affordable housing bond in Santa Clara County.\n\nLong-term housing is the only way to resolve someone's homelessness, which is why it has been the gold standard in the state. But it can take years to build, and voters aren't always patient.\n\n\"If you push all your chips to the middle of the table on permanent supportive housing, you start to lose your constituency because constituents are coming by in their cars every day and seeing more tents and more illegal encampments,\" Cortese said. \"And their thought process is, 'I thought we just put a billion dollars into eradicating homelessness. What's going on? Why is it getting worse?'\"\n\nLand is scarce and expensive in California, making it hard to replicate a shelter as large as Haven for Hope. But city staff in San José are looking into whether some version of it can be done there, said Housing Director Erik Soliván, who was on the Texas trip.\n\nWhile it may seem unusual for the Golden State to look to Texas in search of advice on social services, Californians have been awed by Haven for Hope for years. CalMatters wrote about the phenomenon in 2023.\n\nThe Texas shelter has made some changes since then. About 1,600 people slept in the shelter in 2023, and the facility served 85% of the city's homeless population.\n\nBut even that giant facility couldn't hold everyone. The space was overcrowded, with hundreds of people sleeping on the floor on mats inches apart. Haven for Hope had to pause enrollments and put new rules in place to limit who can come in. In the last fiscal year, the population was down to an average of 1,453 people per night. About 60% of those are in a program that regularly conducts drug and breathalyzer tests.\n\nCalifornia will have to do more to embrace that style of shelter if it doesn't want to get left behind by the federal administration, said Elizabeth Funk, founder and CEO of shelter provider DignityMoves, who went on the Texas trip.\n\nThe Trump administration appears poised to divert money from permanent housing and into temporary housing that comes with sobriety and other requirements. But we won't know the extent of that change until the government shutdown ends.\n\n\"The federal government is going to come down with a bunch of money for things that don't allow drug use,\" Funk said, \"and that needs to fit in our system.\"",

    "body": "GOING VIRAL -- When Gavin Newsom needed to hype his redistricting ballot measure, he did it not through MSNBC hits, but livestreamed sit-downs with Substack sensation Heather Cox Richardson, YouTube star Brian Tyler Cohen and TikTok celebrity Mrs. Frazzled.\n\nThe Prop 50 campaign was the purest distillation of Newsom's self-proclaimed obsession with the changing media landscape, an unabashed embrace of the burgeoning liberal influencer ecosystem that is burgeoning at the same time Newsom's political prospects are on the rise.\n\nNewsom's team not only courted online content creators; it incorporated them into the campaign apparatus itself, leaning on influencers to help with fundraising, rapid response and in-person events.\n\n\"It's not a program, it's a way of doing things,\" said Lindsey Cobia, a senior political adviser to Newsom. \"It is truly ingrained in everything we do.\"\n\nNewsom, a likely presidential contender in 2028, has for months argued Democrats are woefully behind in countering the robust conservative mediasphere. His fascination with personalities such as Steve Bannon and Charlie Kirk earned him outsized attention -- and grief with his base. But he also has been steadily nurturing his ties to the left's constellation of content creators.\n\nThe outreach began not long after the Los Angeles fires in January, when conservative critics of Newsom's fire response flooded social media. The governor responded with a social media presence that was assertive, snarky and unapologetically online. Since then, he's seen his national profile grow with every all-caps post on X -- and with his frequent appearances on popular liberal programs.\n\n\"They were ahead of their time with that and recognized it right away -- really before any others did,\" said Ben Meiselas, co-founder of MeidasTouch, a liberal digital network with a slate of shows that rack up between 500 and 750 million views a month. \"Now others are seeing that those types of interviews are getting more attention and having a higher viewership than the cable hits.\"\n\nNewsom still pays close attention to traditional media. In the closing days of the campaign, he hit the Sunday show circuit, appearing on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" and CBS News' \"Sunday Morning,\" and did interviews with POLITICO and other outlets.\n\nBut for months, Newsom's team behind the scenes has been cultivating relationships with top influencers. Staffers text content creators on a daily basis, much like they would with beat reporters covering the governor. The office keeps a spreadsheet that tracks every interview and every view Newsom gets across all platforms.\n\nFor Prop 50, staff sent out a weekly email to roughly 100 influencers sharing campaign messaging, pushback to the opposition's talking points and the latest videos of the governor. At a Los Angeles GOTV rally, content creators had their own dedicated riser with unobstructed views to capture the footage.\n\nThe result was a cadre of personalities with outsized online followings who felt personal buy-in for Newsom's effort. Cohen, whose YouTube channel has nearly 5 million subscribers, said he considered himself part of the campaign and emcee'd a three-hour livestream featuring the governor and 17 other content creators. He credited Newsom and his team for their fluency in the online ecosphere, akin to other social media phenoms such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Zohran Mamdani.\n\n\"This is not an old media campaign that has been retrofitted for a new media platform,\" Cohen said. \"This is very organically new.\"\n\nHe added, \"They go viral on a daily basis. That doesn't happen on accident.\"\n\nGOOD MORNING. Happy Friday. Thanks for waking up with Playbook.\n\nLike what you're reading?

Nothing official announced.\n\nBEHIND THE BIG ANNOUNCEMENT -- Nancy Pelosi's decision to retire was such a closely-held secret that she filmed two versions of the video she released on Thursday -- one to tee up a reelection campaign and the other that she ultimately posted, as Dustin and Nicholas Wu report.\n\nSome of her closest political allies were not informed until late the night before, some not until about five minutes beforehand, according to a Pelosi adviser and two allies granted anonymity to discuss the run-up to her announcement.\n\nMost observers in San Francisco expected she would not run again in 2026. But few could say for sure, however, because with the exception of a handful of her immediate family members and close advisers, Pelosi had worked to keep everyone in her hometown guessing.\n\n\"She was going to make an announcement on her own terms, her own turf,\" said an adviser. \"We kept a very small circle.\"\n\nEMANUEL REFLECTS -- Rahm Emanuel worked closely with Pelosi, first as a member of her leadership team and then as President Barack Obama's chief of staff during Affordable Care Act negotiations. In an interview with Nicholas Thursday, Emanuel noted his appreciation for the realpolitik approach that Pelosi brought to making legislative change.\n\n\"She doesn't just talk ideas,\" he said. \"She knows that winning elections is the only way you can enact those ideas. And sometimes a lot of people in our activist wing don't understand that winning elections is the route to enacting your policy goals.\"\n\nRead their full conversation here.

But needy households in San Francisco aren't feeling as much pain.\n\nThe city has already sent out more than $4 million in gift cards to help cover grocery bills for families receiving SNAP benefits, part of a partnership funded by the city and the Crankstart Foundation, the philanthropic arm of billionaire Michael Moritz. Mayor Daniel Lurie's office said nearly 18,000 households claimed the temporary assistance in the first two days of the program.\n\n\"The situation in Washington seems to be changing by the hour,\" Lurie told Playbook. \"In San Francisco, we're providing certainty and taking care of our neighbors.\"\n\nMAYOR MOVES -- Republican Kevin Lincoln is running for the new 13th Congressional District now that it's been redrawn to include downtown Stockton, where he's the former mayor. That sets him up to challenge Democratic Rep. Adam Gray rather than Rep. Josh Harder, who he was previously running against in his current district and failed to unseat last year.\n\nGray flipped the 13th District by fewer than 200 votes in one of the nation's closest House races. Under Prop 50, it will become 8 percentage points more Democratic.\n\nThat's friendlier territory for a Republican than Harder's redrawn 9th District, which was already safer for Democrats and is jumping 14 points to a roughly 24 point Democratic registration advantage after redistricting, according to California Targetbook.\n\nPrepared statements on the announcement hinted that the campaign from each side will, in the mold of a moderate district, focus heavily on cost of living and crime issues.\n\n\"While families across the Valley are working harder than ever to make ends meet, Washington politicians like Adam Gray have fallen in line with a failed liberal agenda that's made life less affordable and less safe,\" Lincoln said.\n\nDemocratic Congressional Campaign Committee spokesperson Anna Elasser shot back that \"Lincoln can run for Congress wherever he wants, but he can't run from his record of skyrocketing housing and utility costs, rampant crime, and taxpayer-funded perks for himself.\"\n\nDOCK DRAMA -- Dockworkers are fuming over an agreement between air quality regulators and the nation's largest ports that doesn't include limits on automated equipment -- and they're pointing a finger at Newsom.

    "body": "With help from Camille von Kaenel, Noah Baustin and Chase DiFeliciantonio\n\nAI ON THE WATERFRONT: Dockworkers' fight to keep automated equipment out of ports' climate strategies is back on -- and this time, Gov. Gavin Newsom is at the center of it.\n\nSouthern California air quality regulators will vote Friday on an agreement -- after nearly a decade of negotiations -- with the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach to ditch diesel-powered equipment for zero-emission alternatives. But it's what's not on the table that has labor unions fuming.\n\nThe International Longshore and Warehouse Union, which represents some 40,000 workers on the West Coast, is pushing for new restrictions to limit public funding for automated port equipment that it argues threatens members' livelihoods. Newsom's veto of SB 34 -- a bill that emerged as the union's anti-automation play late in the session -- guarantees that won't happen this year.\n\nLongshoremen are throwing down the gauntlet and taking direct aim at Newsom's presidential ambitions.\n\n\"We thought that the governor was going to be proactive, a very progressive candidate for president,\" ILWU Local 13 President Gary Herrera said in an interview. \"It really has opened our eyes, and the next time somebody comes for endorsement, we will not make a decision lightheartedly.\"\n\nThe warning puts a spotlight on the delicate balancing act that Newsom is trying to maintain between supporting labor unions -- which have historically backed Democratic candidates -- and climate goals.\n\nNewsom argued in his veto that the bill would have interfered with \"ongoing good faith efforts\" negotiations between the ports and air quality officials.\n\nHerrera said that Newsom declined to speak with the union before rejecting the bill, seriously fracturing his relationship with dockworkers. The veto has ruffled feathers across the country, drawing stinging rebukes from both ILWU International President Robert Olvera Jr. and International Longshoremen's Association President Harold Daggett, who represents workers on the East Coast, Gulf Coast and Great Lakes.\n\n\"Make no mistake: your veto of SB 34 has severely damaged our confidence to work together to achieve these goals and it will take more than rhetoric to rebuild a partnership in the future,\" Olvera wrote in a letter to Newsom last month.\n\nNewsom has previously run afoul of the Teamsters, who've slammed the governor for rejecting multiple bills to restrict autonomous taxis and heavy-duty trucks they've framed as both job killers and less environmentally friendly than human-driven electric vehicles (pointing to the large amount of electricity needed to power artificial intelligence).\n\nSpokespeople for Newsom declined to comment on the unions' criticism of the governor.\n\nIt's created an awkward situation for environmental groups, which are trying to ally with unions but bristled at SB 34's attempt to link automation with efforts to phase in electric equipment.\n\n\"I think that there is some sympathy amongst our organizations for those concerns,\" said Chris Chavez, deputy policy director for the Coalition for Clean Air. \"But if you look at the language, it still very much frames health-protective rulemaking as a problem rather than pollution.\"\n\nThe dockworker-regulator relationship is likely to sour more Friday. ILWU says that even without the bill, they want the South Coast Air Quality Management District to include automation restrictions in the agreement that would require the ports to develop a five-year zero-emission infrastructure plan and give regulators authority to issue penalties if they miss deadlines.\n\n\"I want to be part of the solution,\" Herrera said. \"And I think labor has been overlooked way too long.\"\n\nThe odds aren't in the union's favor. A last-minute inclusion of automation restrictions would very likely blow up a deal that's emerged out of negotiations dating back to 2017.\n\nRegulators are pushing back ahead of the vote, arguing that it's not their role to regulate automation. SCAQMD staff said the agency's stance hasn't changed, pointing to a previous statement shared with POLITICO.\n\n\"Electrification does not equal automation or less jobs,\" spokesperson Nahal Mogharabi said late last year. \"There is a varying level of automation at our ports already in the absence of air quality regulations. In fact, we have seen automation using diesel equipment.\" -- AN\n\nDid someone forward you this newsletter? Sign up here!\n\nTHE CALIFORNIA PASSPORT: Newsom will head to United Nations climate talks in Brazil as Californians show growing appetite for their state to play a bigger role in global affairs, according to new polling from the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace shared with POLITICO ahead of publication later this month.\n\nAs President Donald Trump vows to dismantle international efforts to promote renewable energy and puts tariffs on imports, two-thirds of respondents said they're at least somewhat concerned about a disconnect between U.S. foreign policy and California's priorities -- up from just under half a year ago.\n\nThe survey found that 42 percent of Californians think state officials should pursue international engagement, such as memorandums of understanding or policy exchanges -- up from 34 percent in 2024 and 33 percent in 2023. (The sentiment breaks sharply along party lines: 61 percent of Democrats said yes, compared with only 21 percent of Republicans.)\n\nBut the poll also shows shifting priorities. This year, trade has overtaken climate change as Californians' top concern for their state and local leaders' interactions abroad -- a sign of anxiety over the White House's tariff policies. Thirty-one percent of respondents ranked trade as their top issue for international talks, compared with 29 percent for climate change. Just two years ago, climate ranked first at 49 percent, while trade trailed far behind at 16 percent.\n\nStill, Californians aren't changing their mind about whether the United States should play a leading role in addressing climate change: a majority of respondents (57 percent) said yes, similar to past years.\n\nThe findings are based on a survey of 1,600 Californians conducted between July 28 and Sept. 2. -- CvK\n\nSPEAKING OF: Oregon is joining the MOU game. The state signed a climate- and trade-friendly agreement with the United Kingdom on Wednesday, reports POLITICO's Sophia Inge from London.\n\nINSURE THIS: California Environmental Voters is endorsing Sen. Ben Allen in his bid for California Insurance Commissioner next year in an announcement shared exclusively with POLITICO on Thursday.\n\n\"This office is often overlooked, but not anymore,\" said Mike Young, the group's executive director. \"As rate hikes hit headlines, Californians deserve a commissioner who isn't bought by insurance companies and who will fight for everyday people.\"\n\nThe group is planning \"significant\" spending in the race, but hasn't settled on a number yet, added spokesperson Erika Guzman Cornejo.\n\nThe endorsement, the group's first in a statewide race this election cycle, shows how environmental and community groups alike are increasingly paying attention to the regulatory office as property insurers retreat from the state's record-breaking wildfires.\n\nJust Thursday morning, a group of Angelenos struggling with insurance after January's wildfires called on Newsom to ask current Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara to resign for passing new rules they say don't do enough to require property insurers cover fire-prone properties. -- CvK\n\nCOUNT 'EM: California's greenhouse gas emissions are on the down slope.\n\nThe state recorded a 3 percent decline in emissions in 2023, according to California Air Resources Board data released Thursday. That was the third-largest year-over-year drop since CARB began tracking emissions through its mandatory reporting program in 2000.\n\nOverall emissions dropped to 360.4 million tons, down from 371.1 million in 2022. That number, however, remains well short of the state's 2030 goal of 260 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions.\n\nThe transportation sector drove the drop with its 17 percent decline in heavy-duty truck emissions. CARB chalked that up to rising use of renewable diesel and biodiesel, both incentivized through the low-carbon fuel standard.\n\nIndustrial sector emissions dropped by 5 percent, but residential emissions rose by 2 percent. That was likely due to increased use of gas heaters during a colder-than-average winter, according to CARB.\n\nThe state will face transportation-sector headwinds in coming years now that the Trump administration has revoked California's zero-emission sales mandates for cars and heavy-duty trucks. -- AN, NB\n\nSHOVELS AT THE READY: San Jose Mayor Matt Mahan is announcing his most ambitious gambit yet to secure his city the title of AI capital of the world. The tech-aligned mayor has new plans for massive data centers and advanced manufacturing facilities on the city's north side, reports Chase DiFeliciantonio for POLITICO's California Decoded newsletter.\n\nMahan told Decoded that Prologis, the largest industrial real estate company in the world, would be in charge of developing the 160-acre site near Highway 237 that he hopes to see up and running in 2030.\n\nThe project is based on Pacific Gas and Electric's long-term plans to triple the city's grid capacity in the coming years by adding 2 gigawatts of power to San Jose. About an eighth of that new capacity is expected to power the Prologis campus, and Mahan said the project could ultimately use a quarter of the city's expected new wattage.\n\nAsked where that power will come from and its renewability, the mayor's office said that will be part of the negotiation with Prologis, but that they will push for it to come from San Jose Clean Power, the city's public utility company that provides 100 percent clean energy to some residents. -- NB\n\n-- Communities living close to oil and gas infrastructure are consistently home to greater shares of Black and Latino residents and have lower median household incomes, UCLA researchers found.\n\n-- Here's how to take advantage of federal tax credits for home electrification upgrades before they expire on Dec. 31.\n\n-- It's not all cute animals and sunshine covering the surprisingly divisive world of California wildlife policy.\n\nCALIFORNIA POLICY IS ALWAYS CHANGING: Know your next move.

    "body": "Anger is focused on State Farm, with victims citing low estimates and poor claim handling; Commissioner Lara's office says he's acted decisively.\n\nVictims of the January wildfires in Los Angeles County urged Gov. Gavin Newsom on Thursday to call for the resignation of California Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara, saying the regulator has allowed insurers to run roughshod over them.\n\nLara, an independently elected state official, was accused at an Altadena news conference of being too closely aligned with the interests of insurers who homeowners say have delayed, denied and lowballed claims, forcing victims to tap retirement accounts and max out credit cards as they fight for their benefits.\n\n\"Gov. Newsom, we need your help. Your Palisades constituents have your back. Now is the time for you to have ours,\" said Jill Spivack, 59, a Pacific Palisades resident whose home of 25 years burned down but who has yet to start rebuilding.\n\n\"You made promises when the cameras were rolling,\" Spivack added. \"Now we need to see your actions behind those words. Commissioner Lara has proven he won't protect consumers. Please replace him with someone who will.\"\n\nThe event, attended by several dozen Altadena and Pacific Palisades fire victims, was held by the Eaton Fire Survivors Network and attended by other groups, including the Los Angeles insurance advocacy group Consumer Watchdog, which called on Lara to resign last year.\n\nJoy Chen, executive director of the network, cited recent surveys that found 70% of insured survivors have encountered delays and denials, while 8 in 10 Eaton and Palisades fire survivors are still displaced. The fires damaged or destroyed nearly 13,000 homes.\n\n\"We have an unprecedented housing crisis on our hands, which grew out of the insurance crisis on our hands,\" Chen said. \"That is why it is so urgent that Gov. Newsom act now.\"\n\nNewsom's press office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson for Lara -- whose term expires in 2026 -- rejected any suggestion he would resign.\n\n\"The facts are Commissioner Lara has moved quickly and decisively to respond to the fires, including using every tool available to ensure wildfire survivors receive all the benefits they are entitled to under current law,\" said Michael Soller, the department's deputy commissioner of communications.\n\nOn Saturday, Lara had posted on X, \"I'm here to finish the job -- and leave the next Commissioner in a stronger position than I inherited.\"\n\nTo advance its goals, the Eaton network established a website -- lararesign.org -- where fire victims and others can send emails to the governor and Lara asking for the commissioner's resignation and leaving comments.\n\nMuch of the anger from fire victims has been directed at State Farm General, California's largest home insurer, which dropped tens of thousands of policyholders in recent years and has been the target of complaints about its claims handling.\n\nSpivack, who said her home on Aderno Way has been insured by State Farm for decades, said that it has been a full-time job getting her personal property claims paid amid changing adjusters and other issues.\n\nMeanwhile, she has been haggling with the insurer for months after getting an estimate of only $250 a square foot to rebuild her home, less than a third of the going rate.\n\n\"At first we thought, thank goodness we have insurance. We've been loyal State Farm customers for 25 years,\" Spivack said. \"We trusted their promise to help us rebuild like a good neighbor. But what we faced instead is confusion, lowball estimates and a delay at every turn.\"\n\nAltadena resident Branislav Kecman, 64, who lost his Crescent Drive home of 12 years in the fire, said he was dropped by State Farm in July 2024 and forced onto the FAIR Plan where his coverage dropped from $1.5 million to $1 million but got more expensive.\n\n\"We really feel betrayed by our system, especially our commissioner that's supposed to fight for our interest instead of, so to speak, being in bed with the insurance companies,\" he said.\n\nBob Devereux, a State Farm spokesperson, said the insurer has handled more than 13,500 claims and paid almost $5 billion to January wildfire victims, with nearly 200 claim adjusters still on the ground.\n\n\"State Farm is committed to paying customers what they're owed. We're here every step of the way and working with elected officials to build a more sustainable insurance market in California,\" he said.\n\nChen and Carmen Balber, executive director of Consumer Watchdog, also accused Lara of exacerbating the state's insurance crisis through loopholes in his Sustainable Insurance Strategy, which was backed by the governor.\n\nThe regulatory changes gave insurers concessions, including the right to charge homeowners for reinsurance, in exchange for a pledge to write more policies in fire-prone neighborhoods.\n\nHowever, since the deal was announced in 2023 insurers have dropped hundreds of thousands of homeowners onto the FAIR Plan's rolls, as The Times has reported.\n\nChen advocated for a new insurance commissioner to adopt a five-point plan developed by the Eaton group to improve the insurance market and oversight of insurers.\n\nThat plan includes finishing an investigation into State Farm's claims practices started this year by the department within 60 days -- and freezing any rate hikes for the insurer until the claims issues are resolved. (Lara's stance has been that the two issues are legally separate matters.)\n\nOther elements of the plan include ending denials by the FAIR Plan of smoke damage claims -- another issue the department is investigating -- and preventing \"illegal cuts'' in temporary housing benefits while survivors rebuild.\n\nSoller said the department is already working on the various matters raised.",

    "title": "Chris Hayes: 'Dummymadering': How the GOP's redistricting push could backfire",
    "body": "On Tuesday, voters in California overwhelmingly approved a measure that allows the state's legislature to redraw its congressional districts, flipping up to five seats to Democrats in next year's midterm election.\n\nIt's known as Proposition 50 and was championed by Gov. Gavin Newsom as a response to the new Texas congressional maps that Republicans drew up at Donald Trump's request, which could take up to five seats away from Democrats in next year's midterms.\n\nOn Wednesday, California Republicans sued to stop the state from moving forward with redistricting and claimed the new map is unfair -- even as their party seeks to gerrymander other red states.\n\nIt appears Republicans are pretty much committed to picking their voters, rather than letting the voters pick them. This year, four Republican-controlled states have already redrawn their maps at Trump's request: Texas, Missouri, Ohio and North Carolina. The new maps would flip nine seats to Republicans -- at least in theory.\n\nBut nobody is talking about stopping there. Republicans in Indiana, Nebraska and Florida are all at least exploring redder congressional maps at Trump's behest. And several Democratic-controlled states are talking about responding in kind.\n\nWe are in a gerrymandering arms race, and there is no mystery as to why. After Tuesday's drubbing, House Speaker Mike Johnson made it clear that redistricting is how Republicans think they will win.\n\n\"I think the midterm is gonna be a great one for us,\" Johnson told reporters on Wednesday. \"We had a demographic shift in 2024. We have a very favorable election map on the Republican side, and it will be even more favorable once all the redistricting stuff has settled out.\"\n\nBut based on what we saw at the polls, I'm not so sure redistricting alone is going to be enough for Republicans. If you are pulling supporters from a deep-red district to make another district red, you end up with two less-red districts. You also can't guarantee that your red voters from the last election will turn out for you again.\n\nThat means the Republicans' plan could backfire. If voters are angry enough at them, as they were on Tuesday, Republicans could lose both those \"red\" districts. Political scientists even have a word for the phenomenon: \"dummymandering.\"\n\nDumb or not, this is how Republicans think they'll win. But as Newsom said on Tuesday, they will be opposed.\n\nThe California governor had a message for his fellow blue state governors: \"We need the state of Virginia. We need the state of Maryland. We need our friends in New York and Illinois and Colorado. We need to see other states, the remarkable leaders that have been doing remarkable things, meet this moment head-on as well.\"",

    "body": "DRIVING THE DAY: Gavin Newsom will headline a rally in Texas on Saturday alongside Lone Star state House members and dignitaries -- an event designed as an aggressive show of force in the wake of California Democrats' resounding gerrymander victory on Tuesday, Blake Jones scooped this morning.\n\nNewsom, a likely 2028 presidential candidate, also returned $3 million from his ballot measure account to the House Majority PAC, the flagship Democratic-aligned super PAC and a partner in California's Proposition 50, for the committee to help fund redistricting efforts in other states.\n\nLET THE GAMES BEGIN: With Proposition 50 over and Sen. Alex Padilla staying out of the California governor's race, Democratic candidates are jostling to shape the narrative about the field.\n\nPadilla would have been a serious contender and, until his Election Day announcement, had not ruled out running -- receiving behind-the-scenes encouragement from labor and other interest groups that hadn't settled on any of the other candidates.\n\nHis decision has top rivals fighting for position while keeping an eye out for other possible competition, like billionaires Rick Caruso or Tom Steyer, or Rep. Eric Swalwell, who might be encouraged by the Padilla-sized hole in the field. Caruso is contemplating a run for either Los Angeles mayor or governor but has not yet announced his decision. Steyer's large Prop 50 ad buy sparked conversation that he also wants to join the race.\n\nAs the field fills out, campaigns for former Orange County Rep. Katie Porter and former Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra are circulating memos touting their candidates' positions. And Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa's campaign is sharing its own poll indicating that Porter's recent gaffes have hurt her popularity with voters, the Sacramento Bee reported.\n\nPorter's campaign is playing up her advantages and past polling numbers to make the case that the viral videos that surfaced last month of her berating a staffer and melting down during a candidate interview didn't affect her. The memo calls her the \"clear and steady frontrunner,\" citing her public polling lead, labor endorsements and Donald Trump-fighting bonafides.\n\nIt suggests she has only strengthened her lead as Padilla and former Vice President Kamala Harris opted not to jump into the race, while Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis and former Senate President Pro Tem Toni Atkins dropped out.\n\n\"Katie has continued to build the campaign that's earned steadfast voter support, endorsements, and financial resources,\" the memo said.\n\nBecerra's campaign, meanwhile, is calling the race \"wide open\" -- implying the Porter videos did, in fact, do significant damage to her chances while calling the former attorney general \"the clear Democratic alternative to Katie Porter in the race for California Governor.\"\n\nThe team's memo cited polling showing Becerra behind Porter but ahead of Villaraigosa, with many voters still undecided and suggests he has \"substantial room for growth,\" especially if he can peel off Porter voters. It called her support \"volatile,\" while his has \"held steady.\"\n\nBecerra's memo also stacked the secretary against Swalwell. The Bay Area representative, who was the subject of recent polling, is \"strongly considering\" entering the race, according to an ally briefed on his plans who was granted anonymity to discuss the deliberations. Swalwell has been sending signals -- namely criticizing Porter for her behavior -- that he might get into the contest.\n\n-- with help from Melanie Mason and Blake Jones\n\nIT'S THURSDAY AFTERNOON.

Norco, the equestrian-centric town known as Horsetown USA, will now be in Rep. Norma Torres's 35th District.\n\n\"Under the new district lines, our campaign for fresh representation in CA-41 ends,\" Aleman said in a statement.

    "body": "With their overwhelming approval of Proposition 50, California voters signaled their clear and unmistakable disdain for President Donald Trump and the Republican Party. They also delivered Gov. Gavin Newsom a signature political victory that cements his status as the leading Democratic frontrunner for the 2028 presidential election.\n\n\"Donald Trump poked the bear. And the bear roared back,\" declared Newsom. \"Tonight, California sent a powerful message to Donald Trump. We will fight for our democracy. And we will win.\"\n\nAs of this writing Wednesday afternoon, the \"Yes\" side received nearly 64% of the vote. That's a thumping no matter how you spin it.\n\nFor reference, in the Nov. 2024 presidential election, Vice President and former California Senator Kamala Harris received 58.47% of the vote.\n\nIn 2022, Gov. Newsom was reelected with 59% of the vote. And in 2021, Californians rejected the recall of Newsom with 62% voting to defeat it.\n\nAs an editorial board that opposed Proposition 50 and supported Newsom's recall, there's really no serious way to spin this other than a triumph for Newsom and a rejection of Trump.\n\nOf course, reality hasn't stopped some Republicans from trying to make excuses or generate bizarre explanations.\n\n\"The Unconstitutional Redistricting Vote in California is a GIANT SCAM in that the entire process, in particular the Voting itself, is RIGGED,\" Trump posted on Truth Social. \"All 'Mail-In' Ballots, where the Republicans in that State are 'Shut Out,' is under very serious legal and criminal review. STAY TUNED!\"\n\nWe're still waiting for President Trump to provide a shred of evidence that the 2020 elections were stolen.\n\nNewsom, meanwhile, has taken the opportunity to try his hand at being a national political influencer by appealing to other Democratic states to do what he pulled off in California.\n\n\"We need the state of Virginia, we need the state of Maryland, we need our friends in New York, in Illinois, in Colorado, we need to see other states...meet this moment head on as well,\" he said. \"To recognize what we're up against in 2026.\"\n\nTime will tell whether that plays out. For the sake of the country, we hope to see the gerrymandering games end. In July, we wrote, \"Gerrymandering is a longstanding political art form. But mid-term redistricting efforts move our system in the wrong direction. Republicans are the real hypocrites here. If they're serious about protecting independent redistricting efforts, they should publicly oppose changing the rules in Democratic California and Republican states, too.\"\n\nAlas, that didn't happen. Republicans started this gerrymandering spat in Texas and are now playing the victim because California responded. It's absurd.\n\nBut, regardless, Newsom has successfully offset what Texas Republicans did and proved he can galvanize donors and voters alike to deal a blow to Republicans. That was his play to national Democrats and he won. The California GOP, meanwhile, has been left looking like an amateurish operation.",

Thanks to Gov. Gavin Newsom for the return of 17,000 acres of ancestral land to the Tule River Tribe.\n\nThe first elected California governor, Peter Hardeman Burnett, infamously declared that a \"war of extermination will continue to be waged between the races until the Indian race becomes extinct.\" His administration, using the precedent of the Doctrine of Discovery, facilitated the removal of Native Californians from their lands, enabled their effective enslavement through indentured servitude and contributed to a state-sponsored genocide. His state policies included funding militias to kill Natives, leading to a catastrophic decline in the California Native population, which dropped from an estimated 150,000 in 1846 to around 30,000 by 1873. Tragically, it is a microcosm of our nation's Indigenous abuses.\n\nThis history is anathema to our claim of American exceptionalism and is what the present administration wants to eliminate from our national parks, museums and history books.

    "body": "One Republican strategist said Newsom's winning redistricting campaign in California transformed him into a top rival of Donald Trump,\" while another conceded it had cemented him as a \"Tier 1 Democrat.\"\n\nThe passage of California's redistricting measure, Proposition 50, said Matthew Bartlett, a Republican strategist and former Trump administration appointee, represented \"the rise of Gavin Newsom as a prime political opponent of Donald Trump.\"\n\nWhile Newsom had been at the forefront of Democrats' opposition to Trump for months, Bartlett said, winning Proposition 50 delivered a tangible political victory in a face-off with the president.\n\nFor Newsom, the high-profile fight over redistricting served as a springboard for the term-limited governor to cultivate political capital with Democrats and expand his small-dollar donor base across the country ahead of his likely presidential run. As Trump and his allies mount pressure campaigns in Republican-led states to redraw their congressional districts ahead of the 2026 midterm elections, Newsom's explicit swing at Trump's overreach proved successful, to the chagrin of Republican leaders-in-waiting who have yet to begin a serious exploration of who could take up the MAGA mantle in 2028.\n\nOne person close to Trump's orbit, granted anonymity to discuss the White House's thinking, said while the outcome was expected, \"Newsom has done a good job of cementing as a Tier 1 Democrat.\"\n\nAhead of the election, the president aired his frustration with Newsom's redistricting push and said on Truth Social that it was \"unconstitutional\" and \"a giant scam.\" Other than those last-minute comments, however, Trump largely sat out of California's redistricting war.\n\nMeanwhile, Newsom's fundraising team was able to raise $100 million in 10 weeks, tapping into major donors who gave to former Vice President Kamala Harris in 2024.\n\nIt was not lost on Republicans how that Prop 50 push could translate to building an apparatus for a national campaign.\n\n\"I believe that Gavin Newsom is definitely using this opportunity to set himself up for a presidential race. There's no question. And to his credit, he brought in over 100,000 new donors that now he can put in his database to use to go out and fundraise,\" said former Republican Rep. Mimi Walters of California. \"It's giving him a higher profile, just given the nature of having a special election and the redistricting mid decade, which is unheard of, clearly has an impact.\"\n\nIf Newsom's rising profile -- and stature among Democrats -- was plain, many Republicans, however, did still not view his success on Tuesday as a risk to the GOP.\n\n\"He's a Democratic governor in a very Democratic state. So, it's not like he can claim to be a political genius as a Democrat in a very Democratic state,\" said Brent Littlefield, a Republican consultant.\n\nVoters' opinions of Newsom, he said, would instead inevitably be based on \"what he's actually done as governor,\" which Littlefield predicted would not \"play well on the national level.\"\n\nOr as Bruce Mehlman, another GOP strategist, put it, \"It was a big win for Newsom that improves his standing in what will surely be a hotly-contested Democratic primary in 2028, but it's less clear how it positions him in a general election battle to win over swing voters.\"\n\nBut Newsom has the GOP's attention. When the California governor posts on social media about Trump or his administration, he typically gets a response from the White House and allies. Newsom in September said \"Kristi Noem is going to have a bad day today,\" which Trump officials elevated and criticized.\n\nFollowing the results on Tuesday, the California governor on social media shared a series of AI images featuring a crying toddler-version of Trump, appearing to have a tantrum while being fed, in a stroller, and with a pacifier.\n\nIt was part of a more confrontational approach to social media that Newsom has embraced in recent months -- and that, while popular with Democrats, Republicans predict could turn off general election voters in 2028. Newsom's future opponents are closely watching what he does on social media, readying for campaign ads in the future, said Sam Geduldig, a lobbyist at CGCN Group and former aide to ex-Speaker John Boehner.\n\n\"Watching Newsom's 'greatest hits' on conservative X accounts is like watching future debilitating campaign ads in real time,\" Geduldig said. \"These clips will be weaponized by any of his future opponents, either in a Dem primary or a general election against a Republican.\"",

    "title": "Gavin Newsom's redistricting win puts him on the 2028 launchpad",
    "body": "The California governor's constituents handed him a career-defining triumph on Tuesday by approving a bid to thwart Donald Trump with a new congressional map that will help California Democrats flip up to five seats, bolstering the party's chance of reclaiming a House majority despite the cascade of red states redrawing their congressional lines at the president's behest.\n\nBut if the election buoyed national Democrats, party strategists around the country saw it, too, as lifting Newsom's presidential prospects, rocket fuel for the California governor in a 2028 primary.\n\n\"Leaders are rewarded when they do the right thing,\" said Neera Tanden, a longtime top policy adviser to Democratic presidents. \"People are going to remember he stood up in this moment.\"\n\nIt wasn't a fight Newsom started, but it was almost tailor-made for him to join, and ultimately lead, given the upsides for both the Democratic Party and his own ambitions. The campaign handed Newsom the opportunity to counter Trump and national Republicans with California's Democratic might, building on years of practice.\n\nA campaign that once looked like like a longshot ended in an unambiguous victory -- and Newsom was its star player, cementing his reputation as the kind of anti-Trump combatant Democrats say they are desperate for. Soon after the win he was positioning himself as a national pacesetter by exhorting fellow Democrats to follow his lead.\n\n\"Any person who pays attention to politics is assuming that this is the precursor to something else,\" said former South Carolina Democratic Party Chair Trav Robertson, whose state Newsom toured this summer in a potential 2028 preview. \"I think Gavin Newsom was the man for the hour, he was looking for this fight, and he answered it very well.\"\n\nEarlier in the year, Newsom was rapidly approaching the kind of lame duck cul-de-sac that can be perilous for ambitious politicians. California's budget was in shambles, his poll numbers were faltering, and devastating wildfires compelled Newsom to play nice with the White House as he cajoled federal help.\n\nThen, in the spring, he was fighting again with the White House, hostilities renewed by Trump's tariffs and troop deployments into Los Angeles amid immigration raids.\n\nIn August, Trump demanded Texas Republicans deliver him more House seats. Already on a wartime footing against a hostile administration that had attacked California on every conceivable front, Newsom seized on a chance to once again make California the epicenter of the resistance. Soon he was hosting dissident Texas Democrats in Sacramento.\n\n\"Governor Newsom showed a lot of courage to do what needed to be done to counteract the clearly political moves Greg Abbott engaged in to follow the orders Donald Trump gave him,\" said Gilberto Hinojosa, former chair of the Texas Democratic Party, referencing his state's Republican governor. \"You've got to have someone who has the courage to stand up to Trump, and that's what Gavin Newsom is doing.\"\n\nNewsom swiftly united top California Democrats and key allies like labor unions behind the plan. But from the start, the California ballot initiative push took on the tenor of a national campaign: Newsom and his team coordinated with House leadership, enlisted party luminaries like Barack Obama, and framed Prop 50 as a maximum-stakes vote on the Trump agenda and American democracy.\n\nIt was a winning message in a Democratic state where Trump is profoundly unpopular. But it also boosted Newsom's image and built out campaign infrastructure far beyond California's borders.\n\nJeff Weaver, a senior adviser on Bernie Sanders' presidential runs, said he was skeptical Newsom's post-Prop 50 boost would continue for long and argued it was clear that California's \"overwhelmingly Democratic\" electorate would approve the measure. Still, Weaver said, Newsom racked up significant advantages in this special election.\n\n\"It gave Governor Newsom an opportunity to further build his list,\" Weaver said. \"It also gave him an opportunity to flex his team. It's very difficult to find opportunities to test your operation. Everything in California is at scale -- not the scale of a presidential, but it's as big as you can get without going national.\"\n\nThe governor brought more than 100,000 new donors into the fold and onto his prized list. He became a campaign season fixture on network television, preaching the perils of Trumpism and extolling California's role in fighting back while finally admitting his interest in the presidency. He reprised the stalwart party warrior role he'd embraced as a surrogate for Joe Biden.\n\nBy the campaign's waning days, Newsom announced he'd raised as much money as he needed and began directing donors to send their money to other frontline Democratic races -- continuing his work to fill a reservoir of goodwill with other Democrats.\n\nHe also reached beyond conventional media by looking to liberal influencers like Brian Tyler Cohen, whose YouTube channel has nearly 5 million subscribers. Cohen was actively a part of the Prop 50 campaign, including hosting a three-hour livestream featuring Newsom, other Democratic officials and a slew of content creators.\n\nCohen said Prop 50 represents the kind of assertive feistiness that is a necessity for anyone vying for the Democratic nomination in 2028.\n\n\"Any politician who puts their neck on the line and abandons the very circumspect mentality of the old Democratic party and actually leans in ten toes forward and fights -- personally, in my opinion, that's the kind of Democratic Party I want to see moving forward,\" Cohen said. \"We have to fight with the same intensity that (Republicans) are fighting. Prop 50 is a testament to exactly that.\"\n\nWinning an anti-Trump campaign in California is very different than winning a Democratic primary in South Carolina or Pennsylvania in a general election. Newsom would still have to answer for serious, entrenched challenges like a homelessness crisis and a soaring poverty rate while articulating a platform beyond stopping Trump.\n\n\"There is a clear difference between being the opposition and the resistance,\" Robertson said, \"and the person who moves people forward and creates the infrastructure needed to win the presidential nomination.\"\n\nAnd there's no guarantee the relentless anti-Trump focus that has propelled Newsom's rise now will carry the same cachet in a presidential primary years from now. San Jose Mayor Matt Mahan, who has repeatedly sparred with Newsom, credited the governor's punchy posture toward Trump as \"cathartic\" for fearful and frustrated Democrats. But he warned it would not be sufficient for Democrats.\n\n\"I think he should call out the president's abuses of power. I think he should stand up for democracy,\" Mahan said. \"I also think there's a risk of social media memes and name calling and all the rest being a sugar high that feels really good today, is extremely popular and leads to a crushing defeat electorally in a couple of years.\"\n\nOther potential 2028 presidential contenders are scrambling not to completely cede the spotlight to Newsom. Maryland Gov. Wes Moore stood up a redistricting advisory commission over the objections of his Democratic state Senate president. Gov. JB Pritzker of Illinois, another state Newsom name-checked after his Prop 50 win, said Wednesday that his state \"may have to react\" if Republicans in neighboring Indiana coalesce behind a redraw.\n\nPennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro's team issued a memo Wednesday morning, shared first with POLITICO, touting his work to protect key state Supreme Court seats this week and win upcoming battleground House races next year. And Sens. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and Cory Booker (D-N.J.), are preparing to travel to early-voting New Hampshire next week.\n\nNevertheless, Newsom has his party's attention now more than at any previous point in his career.\n\n\"He's showing people there are Democrats who are willing to step up and fight,\" said Florida Democratic Party Chair Nikki Fried. \"What that does for his career or a 2028 run I don't know, but he's been an example for Democrats to look to.\"",

    "title": "Many of Altadena's standing homes are still contaminated with lead and asbestos even after cleanup",
    "body": "Eaton Fire Residents United, the advocacy group that compiled the report, is calling on Gov. Newsom to declare an \"ash zone\" to help homeowners more easily get insurance relief.\n\nMore than half of still-standing homes within the area the Eaton fire's ash settled had significant lead contamination even after extensive indoor remediation efforts, according to new findings announced Thursday from the grassroots advocacy group Eaton Fire Residents United. Additionally, a third of remediated homes tested positive for asbestos.\n\nThe results from 50 homes within and downwind of the Eaton burn area provide the first widespread evidence that the remediation techniques pushed by insurance companies and public health officials have not sufficiently removed contaminants deposited by the fire.\n\nLong-term exposure to asbestos increases the risk of developing mesothelioma and other cancers, and long-term exposure to lead can cause permanent brain damage, especially in children, that leads to developmental delays and behavioral problems. No level of exposure to lead and asbestos comes without risks of adverse health effects.\n\n\"This is a community-wide problem,\" said Nicole Maccalla, who leads EFRU's data science. \"It doesn't matter what remediation you're using, one pass is not establishing clearance based on the data that we have, which means that it is not yet safe to return to your home.\"\n\nThat's an issue given that many residents who have been staying elsewhere are returning home -- especially those whose insurance money for temporary housing is running dry. EFRU leaders are encouraging residents to test their homes after remediation work, and, if the results show contamination, to keep remediating and testing until the lab results come back clean.\n\nEFRU -- born in January out of a frustration that no level of government was adequately addressing Altadena residents' environmental health concerns -- started by asking owners of standing homes to share the results of testing they had commissioned from professional labs both before and after remediation.\n\nIn March, EFRU was the first to publish comprehensive results from inside homes that had not yet been remediated: Out of the 53 professional testing reports homeowners shared with the organization, every household that tested for lead had found it.\n\nA similar process was employed for this latest, post-remediation report. Homeowners hired testing professionals to come collect samples and run tests at certified labs, then they shared those results with EFRU. The organization then collated them in a database to give a wider-scope view of contamination in standing homes than any one single test could show.\n\nOf the 50 total homes included in EFRU's report, 45 were tested for lead, and 43 of those had at least some level of lead contamination.\n\nOut of the 18 homes where professionals tested for lead on windowsills specifically, nine exceeded the corresponding level at which the Environmental Protection Agency typically requires further remediation. And out of the 24 homes tested for lead on floors specifically, 15 exceeded the EPA's remediation level.\n\nThere are no official EPA remediation levels for asbestos dust on surfaces. However, asbestos dust was found in nine of the 25 homes that were tested for it in the EFRU report. The average concentration within those homes was significantly above the ad-hoc remediation level the EPA used in New York after 9/11.\n\n\"The number of houses tested is still very low, but considering that most of the homes have been remediated by professional companies, we would expect that all the homes should go below the EPA level,\" said François Tissot, a Caltech geochemistry professor who began testing standing homes after the Eaton fire damaged his own. \"That's the promise of professional remediation.\"\n\nNow, EFRU is calling on the California Department of Insurance to implore insurers to cover testing and, if needed, multiple rounds of remediation. The group is also asking Gov. Gavin Newsom to declare an \"ash zone,\" which would formally recognize the impact of the fire's smoke and ash beyond the immediate burn zone.\n\nAn ash zone, EFRU says, would raise public awareness around health concerns and take some of the burden off individual residents to prove to insurance companies that their home was affected.\n\nThe Department of Insurance did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTissot, who is not involved with EFRU but has been in communication with the group, previously found that wiped-down surfaces had about 90% less lead than those left untouched since the fire. It made EFRU's findings particularly surprising.\n\n\"To see that we are not even breaking 50% with professional remediation is rather alarming,\" he said.\n\nWhile state and federal officials, in collaboration with researchers, have developed playbooks for addressing contamination in drinking water systems and in soil after wildfires, standing-home remediation is something of a Wild West.\n\nInstead of a central government agency working to ensure indoor remediation follows a research-backed recovery approach, a revolving door of insurance adjusters and a hodgepodge of remediation specialists with wildly different levels of qualifications and expertise have set different policies and standards for each home.\n\nEFRU reviews test results primarily from industrial hygienists, who specialize in identifying and evaluating environmental health hazards, most often in workplaces such as manufacturing facilities and hospitals.\n\nIn its review, EFRU found many tests did not even look for lead or asbestos -- despite the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health clearly warning that the two contaminants are known issues in the post-fire area. Those that tested for asbestos often used less-sensitive methods that can under-report levels.\n\nEFRU hopes to work with researchers and officials to develop an indoor contamination playbook, such as the ones that exist for drinking water and soil, designed to help residents both safely and quickly recover.\n\n\"We need coordinated effort from all the different agencies with the elected officials -- either through legislation or pressure,\" said Dawn Fanning, who leads EFRU's advocacy work. \"We can come up with the answers for these residents and for future wildfires.\"",

Gavin Newsom that will redraw the state's congressional districts to be more favorable to Democrats ahead of next year's midterm elections following a similar redistricting push in Texas that favors Republicans.\n\nSan Joaquin County election numbers as of Wednesday afternoon show 53% of voters said \"yes\" to Proposition 50, siding with Democrats in the push to approve the measure. In last year's election, voters in the county aligned with Republicans, with 48.9% voting for Mr. Trump over 48.0% for Harris.\n\nUnited Farmworkers spokesperson Antonio De Loera said the Latino population, the largest demographic in the county, is making all the difference in the outcome of recent elections there.\n\n\"Latino voters are swing voters now,\" he said.\n\nDe Loera said the San Joaquin County vote for Mr. Trump a year ago was about the economy, an issue he said the president is no longer winning with Latinos now.\n\n\"One of the big stories in the 2024 election was that Donald Trump and Republicans did in fact make big gains with Latinos,\" he said. \"Those gains have clearly not been permanent. What we're seeing now is a swing back.\"\n\nFormer San Joaquin County Republican Party chair Bishop Dwight Williams, a Trump supporter, said he believes the county is in new political territory: neither red nor blue.\n\nWilliams said the passage of Proposition 50 is not indicative of how voters in the county feel about the Republican Party.\n\n\"You had millions of dollars spent on the 'yes' side versus the 'no' side,\" he said.\n\nCounties have 30 days to finish counting the ballots. That's when we'll get a final official breakdown of how San Joaquin County voted on Proposition 50.\n\nStill, Williams admits the Election Day result was a disappointment.\n\n\"Obviously, we had hoped for a different outcome,\" he said.",

    "body": "With help from Alex Nieves, Noah Baustin and Annie Snider\n\nFLYING HIGH: Gov. Gavin Newsom is taking his anti-Trump show on the road.\n\nThe California Democrat plans to attend the United Nations climate conference in Brazil next week, stepping into the vacuum left by the Trump administration's decision not to send any senior officials. It'll not only be Newsom's first appearance at a COP but also an opportunity for a victory lap, coming days after his decisive victory on Prop. 50, the redistricting measure that cemented him as his party's most vocal counterweight to President Donald Trump.\n\nNewsom put his trip squarely in that anti-Trump lineage in an interview with POLITICO on Wednesday, saying he was making the trip \"because of the complete abdication of the Trump administration that is joining the Saudis and Russia and the Gulf states.\"\n\n\"It's doubled down on hydrocarbons as the rest of the world is sprinting ahead on low-carbon green growth,\" Newsom said. \"For me, it is about our economic competitiveness, period, full stop.\"\n\nNewsom's attendance underscores his continued efforts to make California a leading stand-in for U.S. engagement on climate change in Trump's second term. Govs. Tony Evers of Wisconsin and Michelle Lujan Grisham of New Mexico, both Democrats, are in Brazil for part of the climate talks, as are dozens of mayors from across the country, but they don't have the heft of the world's fourth-largest economy behind them. Newsom has spent all year positioning the state as a counterweight to federal rollbacks, including by brokering voluntary agreements with other nations and subnational governments.\n\nThe Brazil trip also offers Newsom a platform to boost both his climate credibility and his global profile ahead of a possible 2028 presidential run.\n\n\"I just want to make sure everyone understands we're maybe 2000 miles from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, but we're a world away in terms of our mindset on these issues,\" Newsom said.\n\nNewsom will lead a delegation of state officials that includes Natural Resources Secretary Wade Crowfoot, California Department of Food and Agriculture Secretary Karen Ross, California Public Utilities Commission President Alice Reynolds, California Air Resources Board Chair Lauren Sanchez, and Tribal Affairs Secretary Christina Snider-Ashtari.\n\nThe trip will take him first to an international investment conference in São Paulo, where his agenda includes a fireside chat with Milken Institute CEO Richard Ditizio and meetings with Brazilian officials and business leaders.\n\nThen he will travel to Belém, a city at the mouth of the Amazon River that will host tens of thousands of negotiators, scientists and activists for two weeks of climate talks as part of COP 30. There, he is expecting to tout California's commitments to renewable energy in plenary remarks and other fireside chats and meet with counterparts from around the world to formalize partnerships. He is also expected to travel deeper into the Amazon to meet with \"community stewards,\" according to his office.\n\nNewsom will face the reality that California, despite its swagger, can't play any formal role in nation-to-nation negotiations. But he's trying to get around that: He's co-chairing, remotely, a summit in Rio de Janeiro this week gathering mayors and governors highlighting their efforts to keep cutting emissions despite national backsliding.\n\nAnd climate diplomats from Europe and elsewhere, who lost their bid to impose a global carbon tax on shipping last month amid opposition from the Trump administration, are clamoring for an alternative from the United States at the Brazil talks, even as they water down their own goals.\n\n\"The U.S. will not play a major role,\" said Jochen Flasbarth, undersecretary in the German Ministry of Environmental Affairs, in mid-October. \"The world is collectively outraged, and so we will focus -- as will everyone else -- on engaging in talks with those who are driving the process forward.\"\n\nAlready, the Democrats' state-level victories on Tuesday were resonating abroad. When results came in showing that Democrats had won the governorships of New Jersey and Virginia and two seats on Georgia's utility commission, the group of mayors and governors meeting in Rio to coordinate subnational climate action erupted in applause, former Washington Gov. Jay Inslee said in an interview Wednesday from Brazil.\n\n\"The world is so thirsty for American leadership on energy and climate that they're paying attention to the Georgia Public Service Commission race,\" Inslee said. \"That's how important these things are to the rest of the world. And their conclusion is, America is back in the game.\" -- CvK\n\nALSO GOING TO BRAZIL: Today's newsletter scribe, Camille.

But it was energy that was up for a vote in other parts of the country -- and Democrats won there, too.\n\nEven Republican lawmakers acknowledged Wednesday that Democrats' energy affordability messaging carried the day, as POLITICO's Kelsey Tamborrino and Josh Siegel report.\n\n\"They [Democrats] pounded a message of affordability,\" said Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), chair of the Environment and Public Works Committee, who is up for reelection in 2026. \"And that's a message that we've been working on.\"\n\nTrump's two-sided message of championing the speedy build-out of electricity-gobbling data centers while canceling major clean-energy power projects that could have helped meet the increased demand fell flat with voters, energy experts said.\n\n\"If we're gonna win the AI race and keep prices affordable we need all the electrons,\" Neil Chatterjee, a Republican who chaired the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in Trump's first term, said. \"All of the actions to cut clean energy make no sense and it's totally counterproductive and voters took notice.\"\n\nPower prices in Virginia -- home to the nation's highest concentration of data centers -- have surged 13 percent in the past year, while New Jersey's prices climbed 21 percent, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Both states have seen plans for huge new wind farms threatened by the Trump administration's opposition to the technology.\n\nThe moderate Democrats running in those states, Abigail Spanberger and Rep. Mikie Sherrill, made skyrocketing electricity bills central to their campaigns, and then won their gubernatorial races.\n\n\"The issue of energy prices has taken on a different level of political attention,\" said Jason Grumet, the CEO of the American Clean Power Association. \"For years and years, gasoline prices had been understood to be a political issue. I think this is the first time we're seeing electricity prices become a top three political issue.\" -- NB\n\nYOU'RE FIRED: Survivors of the Los Angeles fires who are pissed about their property insurance woes are preparing to call on Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara to resign on Wednesday.\n\nThe Eaton Fire Survivors Network, a group that formed for those affected by January's wildfire in Altadena, is planning the campaign at a press conference on Thursday in Los Angeles. The group is pointing to a New York Times story describing how Lara's new rules meant to entice insurance companies to stay in the state and cover fire-prone properties also allow companies to continue dropping policyholders like them.\n\nThe call, though unlikely to be heeded, shows how tensions over insurance troubles are boiling over. Lara has long faced criticism for perceived industry coziness. He is termed out in 2026 after winning two four-year terms as insurance commissioner, an independently elected statewide office.\n\nAsked for comment, Insurance Department spokesperson Michael Soller pointed to Lara's social media response to the New York Times story, in which Lara said his office wrote the new rules \"knowing that insurance companies and intervenors would prod and probe for loopholes they think they can exploit.\"\n\n\"I'm here to finish the job -- and leave the next Commissioner in a stronger position than I inherited,\" Lara wrote. -- CvK\n\nHELP US, TRUMP: Arizona's Democratic governor wants the Trump administration to step into the seven-state fight over the depleted Colorado River.\n\nGov. Katie Hobbs sounded the alarm Wednesday during a National Water Resources Association meeting, blasting Colorado, Utah, Wyoming and New Mexico in prepared remarks for refusing to commit to reducing water use while demanding cutbacks from Arizona, California and Nevada, POLITICO's Annie Snider reports.\n\n\"This is the extreme negotiating position we are confronted with as the Upper Basin States, led by Colorado, continue to run down the clock,\" Hobbs said. \"As we approach critical deadlines, we need the Trump administration to step in, exert leadership and broker a deal.\"\n\nThe Trump administration has set a Nov. 11 deadline for state negotiators to hammer out a deal to replace current rules governing the river, which expire at the end of next year. The administration has said that Interior Secretary Doug Burgum will step in if an agreement isn't reached, but that would almost certainly trigger a Supreme Court fight. -- AS, AN\n\nJOIN ME: Sen. Monique Limón will be bringing her current chief of staff with her to the office of the Senate President Pro Tempore.\n\n\"I have named my incoming chief of staff, she is Mariana Sabeniano, she is my current chief of staff,\" Limón said Wednesday during an interview with POLITICO.\n\nThat decision will put a longtime Limón ally in one of the top staff roles in the Legislature. Sabeniano joined Limón's staff as legislative director in 2017, when Limón was an assemblymember. She became chief of staff in 2018, and stayed in that role in 2020, when Limón made the jump to the Senate, according to her Linkedin profile. -- NB\n\n-- The price of water from California's rivers, lakes and reservoirs more than triples during drought years, a new UC Davis study found.\n\n-- Scientists are fuming over Bill Gates' climate memo, calling his argument that a \"doomsday\" view hurts progress on poverty and disease a false dichotomy.\n\n-- There's a growing gap between the rates charged by investor-owned utilities and publicly owned electricity providers, especially in California.\n\nCALIFORNIA POLICY IS ALWAYS CHANGING: Know your next move.

    "body": "The privacy changes web browsers will be required to make under a new California law could set the de facto standard for the entire country, changing how Americans control their data when using the internet, according to experts.\n\nAssembly Bill 566, recently signed into law by Gov. Gavin Newsom, requires companies that make web browsers to offer users an opt-out \"signal\" that automatically tells websites not to share or sell their personal information as they browse.\n\nIt will likely be easier for companies to roll out the service for the entire country, rather than for users only in California.\n\n\"It's such a trivial implementation,\" said Emory Roane, associate director of policy at Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, an organization that pushed for the legislation. \"It's really not that difficult technically.\"\n\nThe legislation, a first of its kind in the country, was sponsored by the California Privacy Protection Agency, the state's consumer privacy watchdog, as well as several consumer advocacy and privacy rights groups.\n\nUnder the law, browsers like Google's Chrome and Microsoft's Edge will have until the beginning of 2027 to create a way for consumers to select the signal. Combined with recent changes from other states, the new law could be a tipping point in how web traffic is treated in the United States.\n\n\"We expect it to have a national impact,\" Roane said.\n\nCalifornia already offers privacy protections under the California Consumer Privacy Act, including customers' right to opt out from having their information sold.\n\nBut advocates for the new law point out this still puts the burden on the consumer to navigate to web pages and individually select web pages to opt out from. The new tool will effectively automate that process, giving consumers a single toggle to keep their data protected.\n\n\"I would argue if you have to go to every individual website and click the link saying you 'don't want your information sold or shared,' that's not really a meaningful privacy right,\" said Caitriona Fitzgerald, deputy director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, another organization that pressed for AB 566.\n\nAlready, some browser makers have voluntarily offered similar settings under a framework called the Global Privacy Control. Mozilla's Firefox, for example, includes a setting called \"tell websites not to sell or share your data.\" With that setting on, the browser communicates to sites that the visitor wants the site to respect the user's preference.\n\nSeveral states, including Texas and New Jersey, have moved to force companies to respect such preferences, and California's attorney general has even taken legal action against businesses that fail to do so.\n\nBut until now, browsers haven't been required to offer a setting that uses the Global Privacy Control or another standard to communicate users' preferences. \"There are browser extensions but those aren't very widely used,\" said Nick Doty, senior technologist at the Center for Democracy and Technology.\n\nSince it would likely be burdensome for companies to carve out a way to only allow the signal to be used by Californians, according to experts, the tool will likely be available across the country. How, exactly, that will look still remains to be seen. The legislation doesn't require browser makers to use a specific standard.\n\nSpokespeople for Google and Microsoft declined to comment on the companies' plans.\n\nThere's still a risk that some websites may try to detect which state a visitor is from, and only respect the signal if they find the visitor is from a state that mandates it.\n\nThis is legally risky, though, according to Roane, who points out that AB 566 applies to residents of California, regardless of whether they're using the web from California.\n\n\"If I'm safe saying I'm a resident and you're assuming I'm not and you're flagrantly not respecting my privacy wishes, that is a violation of the law,\" Roane said.\n\nThe law didn't get across the finish line without friction. As CalMatters reported in September, despite not being publicly against the legislation, Google organized opposition to the bill through a group it backs financially.\n\nAB 566 also wasn't the first attempt at such legislation. Newsom vetoed a similar, but slightly more expansive, version of the bill in 2024.\n\nBut now that the door is open, some advocates say they are going to continue to push to further expand privacy preferences.\n\nRoane notes that legislation could be drafted that requires connected smart devices to offer an opt-out preference, or for vehicles that gather data on drivers to respect opt-out preference requests.\n\n\"We are finally, finally starting to have real privacy rights,\" Roane said, \"but we're far away from them being really easy to exercise across the country and across the border and even in states like California where we have these rights.\"",

    "body": "California Governor Gavin Newsom speaks after he and other lawmakers signed the \"Election Rigging Response Act\" in Sacramento, California, U.S., August 21, 2025. REUTERS/Fred Greaves\n\nThis week, Californians voted overwhelmingly for Prop 50, which replaces the Golden State's current U.S. House of Representatives district map with a new one designed to give Democrats an edge in five Republican districts. The California Republican Party (CAGOP) is now suing to stop the new maps from taking effect, but California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) is doubting that the suit will succeed.\n\nAccording to Politico, the CAGOP sued in U.S. District Court in the Central District of California, claiming the new maps Prop 50 puts in place violate the 14th and 15th Amendments to the U.S. Constitution on the basis of race, \"without cause or basis to justify it.\" The 14th Amendment contains the Equal Protection Clause, which requires states to provide fair legal treatment to all citizens. The 15th Amendment prohibits states from denying citizens the right to vote (which was ratified after the Civil War).\n\n\"While the Constitution entrusts States with designing congressional districts, the Supreme Court has also held that states may not, without a compelling reason backed by evidence that was in fact considered, separate citizens into different voting districts on the basis of race,\" the complaint read.\n\nAfter Prop 50 passed, Steve Bannon -- who was President Donald Trump's chief White House strategist during his first term -- urged the Trump administration to have Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon (who oversees the Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division) sue California and win a temporary restraining order, and preventing Prop 50's new maps from going into effect through litigation. However, California Democratic Party leaders remain confident that Prop 50 will survive any court challenges.\n\nOn Wednesday, KCRA News political director Ashley Zavala reported that Gov. Newsom's office issued a statement in response to the CAGOP's lawsuit -- and included a taunt against both Republicans and Dhillon.\n\n\"We haven't reviewed the lawsuit, but if it's from the California Republican Party and Harmeet Dhillon's law firm, it's going to fail,\" stated Newsom spokesperson Brandon Richards. \"Good luck, losers.\"",

    "body": "EXCLUSIVE: Ultimate Fighting Championship pioneer and legend Royce Gracie has endorsed a pro-law enforcement candidate who is running for governor in California.\n\nOne of the biggest names in mixed martial arts and the first UFC champion, Gracie made a name for himself by taking down much larger opponents through precision and skill.\n\nNow he is weighing into the political sphere in the race to replace Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, who is term-limited and widely rumored to have 2028 presidential ambitions.\n\nIn a statement to Fox News Digital, Gracie said he is endorsing sheriff Chad Bianco's long-shot bid to replace Newsom in 2026. Gracie, a three-time UFC champion, called Bianco a \"fighter\" who is \"exactly who we need.\"\n\nKATIE PORTER SAYS SHE REGRETS VIRAL OUTBURSTS AT REPORTER, STAFFER\n\n\"When Gavin Newsom closed businesses, schools, and churches, one person stood against him, Sheriff Chad Bianco,\" Gracie told Fox News Digital.\n\n\"Chad Bianco didn't fold. He's a fighter, and a fighter is exactly who we need as Governor of California,\" he added, saying, \"We need his strength to turn this state around after the mess Gavin Newsom has created.\"\n\nBianco, who is a vocal Trump supporter and the sheriff of Riverside County, just east of Los Angeles, announced his gubernatorial candidacy back in February, saying, \"Californians deserve better.\"\n\nHe has framed his candidacy around restoring safety and a better quality of life to California.\n\n\"This campaign will not be about the divide between Republicans and Democrats. It will be about the common goal we all have for a better California,\" Bianco emphasized at his campaign launch.\n\n\"As Californians, we want leadership that actually cares about the cost of living ...and leaders who will do something about it,\" Bianco said in his address. \"We want homes we can afford. We want air conditioning when it's hot, not rolling blackouts. We want water for the crops and animals that feed us. We want the opportunity to achieve the California Dream, not be prevented from it because of red tape and regulation from government. We want honesty and transparency from our elected officials. We want lower taxes and less government waste. We want sanity restored and common sense to prevail.\"\n\nPELOSI SPOKESMAN SIDESTEPS RETIREMENT RUMORS AS DEM PRIMARY THREATS WAIT IN WINGS\n\nBianco, who has worked in law enforcement for more than three decades, was first elected sheriff in 2018. A vocal critic of Newsom and soft on crime policies, Bianco was one of the leaders who helped push California's Proposition 36 ballot measure to a landslide victory in last November's elections. The measure, which took effect in December, mandates stiffer penalties and longer sentences in California for certain drug and theft crimes.\n\nIn response to Gracie's endorsement, Bianco told Fox News Digital that \"Californians are waking up, and we are going to clean up this state.\"\n\n\"Gavin Newsom has been chasing away Californians in record numbers,\" he said, adding, \"I'm grateful for the support of patriots like Royce Gracie.\"\n\nFox News Digital reached out to Newsom's office for comment but did not receive a statement by the time of publication.\n\nBianco is facing a steep uphill battle to win as a Republican in deep blue California. It has been nearly two decades since a Republican won a statewide race.\n\nThough still early, the current frontrunner to be Newsom's successor is former Democratic Rep. Katie Porter, a progressive who has made resisting President Donald Trump a central theme of her campaign.\n\nCALIFORNIA FIREFIGHTERS TOLD TO IGNORE SIGNS OF A FIRE: REPORT\n\nXavier Becerra, former U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary under the Biden administration and former California attorney general, is also running for the Democratic nomination.\n\nCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe Democratic and Republican primaries will be held on June 2 next year and the general election will be on Nov. 3.",

    "body": "Voters in former Republican strongholds are seeing red as their districts turn blue after Gavin Newsom and California's voters passed Prop 50, paving the way to flip five House seats to the Democrats.\n\nThe proposition -- which passed overwhelming with 63 percent of the vote -- was a feat of calculated gerrymandering meant to offset a similar, Trump-backed scheme in Texas, theoretically balancing the scales in Washington.\n\nProp 50 eliminates five of the state's Republican congressional districts by swapping the existing map -- drawn by an independent commission -- with one from Democratic state lawmakers until 2030.\n\nBut 2,000 miles away from the Capitol, conservative Californians feel their voice is being stripped away in the name of political gamesmanship.\n\n\"This is just Newsom reacting to Texas. He says, 'They can do it, and we can do it too.' It's like a child throwing a tantrum,\" said Silvia Garcia, 73, who cast a \"no\" vote in her hometown of Lakeside, CA, near San Diego.\n\nLakeside, a Republican enclave, will now be part of a majority-Democrat district for the next five years.\n\nTexas recently took on a gerrymandering plan of its own, hatched at the request of President Trump, who browbeat state lawmakers into drumming up five more seats for the Republicans ahead of the midterms.\n\nLigia Carle, 64, who moved to the U.S. from Mexico City more than 30 years ago, doesn't mind fighting chicanery with chicanery.\n\n\"It's not unfair. They started this. [Trump] is the one who requested an extra five seats,\" she said.\n\n\"It is very disappointing that things can be so crooked. I never expected something like this,\" Carle admitted, but said she hopes Prop 50 will help stymie \"everything that is happening right now, the bad things happening around the country. ICE taking down citizens. I hope it will stop.\"\n\nBut Amy Liebland, 65, a conservative in the town of Huntington Beach, near Los Angeles, believes \"two wrongs don't make a right.\"\n\n\"I'm against it on principle,\" she told The Post.\n\nDiane Adams, 73, from the same town, laments the suspension of the Citizens Redistricting Commission (CRC), an independent body established in 2010 tasked with drawing more equitable district maps.\n\n\"The independent decision-making group we already have should stay in place,\" Adams told The Post.\n\nLarry Shriver, a retiree in the tiny, apple-growing town of Julian, put it more bluntly:\n\n\"Those motherf -- s! I voted not only 'no' but 'hell no!'\" he told The Post.\n\nRobin Kelly, a tax consultant in Riverside, doesn't trust the politicians behind Prop 50 to set things right after 2030.\n\n\"If people think they're are going to allow us to have [the old map] back, they're not...Once we allow gerrymandering, they will never give that up again. They'll always find a way,\" she said.\n\nThat Prop 50 was an act of gerrymandering was never in question.\n\nThe text of the ballot itself described Prop 50 as \"temporary changes to congressional district maps in response to Texas' partisan redistricting.\"\n\nGovernor Newsom even called it \"the most transparent and democratic redistricting that's ever been done in the United States of America.\"\n\nState Republicans disagree, and they are already taking Prop 50 to court.\n\nThe California Republican Party filed a federal lawsuit Tuesday challenging the state's new congressional district maps, alleging Democrats illegally used race as the primary factor in redrawing boundaries to favor Latino voters.\n\nThe complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, seeks to invalidate the new map.",

    "body": "Proposition 50, a measure allowing for the redrawing of congressional districts in California, passed on Tuesday by a wide margin, with Orange County voters joining the statewide majority in supporting it.\n\nThe ballot measure, billed as a response to partisan redistricting in Texas, had secured 63.8% of nearly 8.1 million votes counted as of early Wednesday morning.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom led a Democratic push to put Prop. 50 on the ballot. Its approval allows for new congressional district lines, designed to favor Democrats, in the 2026, 2028 and 2030 general elections. The state would then return to the practice of having the congressional district map drawn by a nonpartisan, independent redistricting commission.\n\nThe special election saw 744,241 votes cast in Orange County, representing a 39% turnout among registered voters. Prop. 50 was supported by 54.6% of the vote countywide, per data provided by the Orange County Registrar of Voters.\n\nThere were fewer voting centers opened than in general elections, which contributed to some lines at the polls.\n\nHuntington Beach had the most voting centers among local cities with five, and Costa Mesa and Newport Beach each provided two. The Fountain Valley Recreation Center and the Laguna Beach Community and Susi Q Center were the only locations for residents to vote in person in their respective cities.\n\nRepublicans hold a slim majority over the Democrats, 219-212, in the U.S. House of Representatives. California currently has 43 Democrats and nine Republicans in the House. Prop. 50 places five Republican-held seats into competitive or easily-winnable territory for Democrats.",

    "body": "\"While the Constitution entrusts States with designing congressional districts, the Supreme Court has also held that states may not, without a compelling reason backed by evidence that was in fact considered, separate citizens into different voting districts on the basis of race,\" the lawsuit reads.\n\nCalifornia voters Tuesday overwhelmingly passed the Newsom-backed gerrymandering plan, paving the way for California to join a constellation of other states in redrawing their congressional lines to favor the party in power. The move specifically aimed to counter similar redistricting efforts from Texas Republicans.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed by the California Republican Party along with a group of California voters and Republican candidates, is the latest pushback in a growing list of litigation across the country attempting to counter gerrymandering in the sweeping redistricting war.\n\nSince the 2020 census, around 100 lawsuits have been filed in attempts to block the redistricting that would threaten either party's congressional strongholds, including a lawsuit from Virginia Republicans last month and four separate suits in September challenging Missouri redistricting that would favor the GOP.\n\nThe prospect of a California gerrymander caught conservatives' attention prior to Proposition 50's victory Tuesday night, with former Trump White House strategist Steve Bannon arguing challenging the redistricting plan should be a top priority for the president.\n\n\"Two things I would do [if I were Trump],\" Bannon told POLITICO Magazine. \"Number one, get [Assistant Attorney General] Harmeet Dhillon and the Justice Department to go out and file suit against this scam of [California Gov. Gavin] Newsom on this redistricting plan that went against the constitution of California. I would get the Justice Department to file suit, go get a [temporary restraining order] immediately, and then hit this thing and drag it out for a year.\"\n\nBut California Democrats have maintained throughout their campaign for Proposition 50 that they're confident the redistricting efforts could survive legal challenges.\n\n\"We haven't reviewed the lawsuit, but if it's from the California Republican Party and Harmeet Dhillon's law firm, it's going to fail,\" Brandon Richards, a spokesperson for Newsom, said in a statement. \"Good luck, losers.\"",

    "title": "What the Democrats' Good Night Means for 2026 and Beyond",
    "body": "Election Night 2025 was a good one for Democrats. On Tuesday, the Party recaptured the governorship in Virginia, with the victory of the former congresswoman Abigail Spanberger over the Republican Lieutenant Governor Winsome Earle-Sears, and held the governorship in New Jersey, with the congresswoman Mikie Sherrill's defeat of Jack Ciattarelli. Both victories had been expected, as was Zohran Mamdani's defeat of Andrew Cuomo in the New York mayoral election. (Spanberger and Sherrill won by approximately fifteen and thirteen percentage points, respectively; Mamdani appears on track for a high single-digit win.) Democrats also did well lower down the ballot in a number of Virginia races, in state races in Pennsylvania and Georgia, and notably in California, where the redistricting referendum led by Gavin Newsom -- a response to Texas's Republican-led effort to create five new G.O.P. House seats -- passed overwhelmingly.\n\nTo talk about the election results, and what they portend for next year's House and Senate races, I spoke by phone with Sean Trende, the senior elections analyst at RealClearPolitics and a visiting scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. During our conversation, which has been edited for length and clarity, we discussed why Democrats managed to outperform expectations, the trouble Republicans face without Donald Trump on the ballot, and what the results mean for 2026 and 2028.\n\nWhat's your biggest takeaway from Tuesday's results?\n\nIt's a bad night to be a Republican. It's hard to see what the silver lining is when you have losses all over the place.\n\nIn the past nine months or so, a lot of people have been saying that the Democratic Party's brand is in the toilet. Democrats are not popular. They seem disliked by much of the country, including a big chunk of their own voters. This is not a good place to be if you're a Democrat. How much does this really matter if you are the opposition party? How did you see that question before tonight, and do you see it any differently now?\n\nI have a long-standing belief that elections are referenda on the party in power. My first reaction when I started hearing the argument that Democrats were in trouble was that I had heard the exact same argument in 2010. You may recall that Obama had an entire post-financial crisis spiel about how the Republicans had driven the car into the ditch and now the Democrats were trying to help it out. It went on for quite some time, but voters didn't care. They didn't like Republicans, but they didn't like what Democrats were doing, either. [Republicans had huge success in the 2010 midterms.] And I think it's the same story today, with the parties flipped. People's dislike of some things that Democrats believe and do might be a problem for governing when Democrats win, but I don't think it's a problem for elections.\n\nTrump is not that popular, but he does bring certain benefits to Republicans when he is on the ballot, especially in terms of turnout. In most elections during the Trump era when he has not been on the ballot, Democrats have done well. Broadly speaking, Republicans seem to do quite poorly when he is not on the ballot.\n\nYeah, we saw a similar thing with Obama. He was a political force and could turn out all kinds of voters in Presidential elections, but the Democrats would get walloped in the off-year elections. And I think Trump has a similar effect. There are a lot of true Trump voters out there who just aren't going to show up in the off-year elections. And, meanwhile, Republicans have kind of traded away their big advantage, which was upper-class suburbanites who vote during the off years. Now those people are mostly Democrats.\n\nWhen I grew up and was following politics, people often talked about the desire of voters to keep a check on the party in power. So, if you had Republicans in power, you would want to vote for Democrats, and the President's party would often lose midterm elections. That still seems true, but now the story seems to be about there being different electorates in off-year elections. Has there been a change of some sort?\n\nI think that, as we've become more polarized and there are fewer swing voters, it's become more about who is voting. It's less of a persuasion game and more of just a simple turnout game. That's the beginning and end of it. We are in a highly polarized environment where there just aren't that many marginal voters, and you don't really see the types of swings that you would have seen from, say, 1964 to 1980. It's just harder and harder to persuade people. It's about getting your voters to the polls, and that's not a good bargain for Republicans right now.\n\nThe theory of politics you have just described -- that it's more about motivating people than persuasion -- is normally viewed more sympathetically by more ideological party members, and less so by centrists. Democrats have been engaging in this debate about whether they need to fire up their own voters or reach out to voters in the center. As someone who's followed your work closely, I would not think of you as someone who has the perspective that parties just need to fire up their own voters. Have you changed your opinion?\n\nGenerally speaking, Americans still don't like radical change. They don't like tariffs being sprung on them willy-nilly. They don't like some of the things that Democrats in power do. So where moderation, I think, can help is when you're actually governing. That distinction is what we were talking about a little bit at the beginning -- about how it doesn't matter that you're unpopular when you're out of power, but, when it comes to governing and we start talking about the, like, seven or eight per cent that's persuadable, it could be a problem.\n\nOn Tuesday, two gubernatorial candidates, in Virginia and New Jersey, who are considered more moderate did quite well, and outperformed the polls. In Virginia, they did better than Democrats had done in 2017, during Trump's first term. And in New Jersey they maybe did a little bit worse, but, at the same time, New Jersey has come much closer to being a purple state in the past decade, or at least it was in the last election. So, do people who are making the case that moderation is crucial for Democrats to win have an argument about these two races?\n\nYeah, and I think you summed up the argument there. If you're looking for a counter on that, it would be the Virginia attorney general's race, right? That's where you had, I think, a pretty radical sounding Democratic candidate. Maybe people rationalized it away, but he ended up running only four points behind Spanberger. And over all, he will win by about six points, and Spanberger will have won by about fifteen. So I think that actually gives you a pretty good insight into what the universe of persuadable voters was. Twenty years ago in Virginia, a guy who got caught texting the things that the soon-to-be attorney general did would have run much worse. [Jay Jones, the Democrat, fantasized in text messages about shooting a Republican colleague.] So that's the polarization and the limit on how much radicalism can hurt you in a general election right there.",

Gavin Newsom blew a big chance Tuesday night to share a vision for America with a national audience.\n\nInstead, the Democrat made his victory speech all about President Donald Trump.\n\nIn a way, that was no surprise: Newsom had campaigned for Proposition 50 -- which sets aside California's independent congressional map in favor of raw, partisan gerrymandering -- as if it were a referendum on Trump, and not about California at all.\n\nAs of Wednesday morning, Prop 50 had won nearly two-thirds of the vote, a sign of the intensity of partisan loyalty among Democrats in the state -- and of California Republicans' despair.\n\nLocal GOP partisans gave up the fight long before Election Day.\n\nEven Rick Caruso, the Republican-turned-Democrat developer who saved his mall from the Palisades Fire by defying incompetent local authorities, felt obliged to support Prop 50 to remain politically viable.\n\nCaruso had to know the ballot measure was bad -- but he funded mailers that promoted it, alongside his photo.\n\nHis best argument for gerrymandering was that without it, California would \"unfairly lose power in DC\" -- an odd claim, since Democrats are already in the minority in the US House.\n\nCaruso also claimed that Prop 50 \"protected our rights in Congress,\" when it actually disenfranchised millions of Californians.\n\nAnd after all that, Newsom didn't bother to thank him in his speech.\n\nVictory presents the opportunity to show magnanimity -- to reach out to opponents and appeal to the common good.\n\nNewsom was having none of that.\n\nInstead, he continued his shrill attacks on the president, sketching a conspiracy theory in which Trump intends to use federal law enforcement and National Guard volunteers -- most of whom lead ordinary civilian lives -- to intimidate voters, seize power and \"rig\" the 2026 midterm elections in favor of Republicans.\n\nIronically, Newsom dangled the specter of Trump \"rigging\" the midterms while complaining that the president had accused him of \"rigging\" this year.\n\nThere is no evidence of fraud, yet Newsom and his party benefited from $282.6 million to run a special election whose only purpose was to boost Democrats' chances of retaking the House -- and to help Newsom set himself up as the party leader ahead of a likely 2028 presidential bid.\n\nNewsom also claimed that Trump intended to quash freedom of speech by sending federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to public gatherings.\n\nYet the California governor has one of the worst records on free speech of anyone in active politics.\n\nLast month, a federal judge threw out Newsom's law banning \"deepfake\" parodies of political candidates, just as the Supreme Court ended his attempts to restrict religious worship during the pandemic.\n\nIn his address to a national audience from Sacramento, Newsom said that Prop 50 was the first step toward the \"de facto\" end of the Trump presidency.\n\nIf Democrats win the House in 2026, he explained, Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) would become speaker, and would wield his power to stop Trump from governing.\n\nNot to advance Democrats' own agenda, but simply to overturn the 2024 election, in which Trump won the popular vote.\n\nNewsom has been cagey about whether he would support Trump's impeachment or not; he's said that he just wants \"oversight\" of the administration.\n\nRecent history suggests that Democrats would be unable to resist the temptation to repeat what they have already tried twice before.\n\nIn making so direct a threat to Trump, Newsom has ended any possibility of cooperation -- this, while California is still asking the federal government for $40 billion in fire aid.\n\nThe governor has to know that he is sacrificing the welfare of his state for his own political ambitions.\n\nHe is taking a calculated risk: That Democratic Party primary voters will care more about how hard a candidate fought against Trump than about how well he or she governed, when given the opportunity.\n\nPerhaps that is Newsom's best strategy.\n\nAfter two terms in office, he has almost no accomplishments, and he wasted no time trying to cite any Tuesday night.\n\nStill, Newsom could have chosen a less hysterical, more constructive tone.\n\nHe could have struck a contrast with New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, who quoted radicals and took potshots at his rivals in his own, strikingly bitter, victory speech.\n\nThe California governor failed to rise to the occasion as he made his bid for party leadership.\n\nIn the glare of a national spotlight, Newsom may have dimmed his own prospects.",

    "title": "New California law could change the way all Americans browse the internet",
    "body": "The privacy changes web browsers will be required to make under a new California law could set the de facto standard for the entire country, changing how Americans control their data when using the internet, according to experts.\n\nAssembly Bill 566, recently signed into law by Gov. Gavin Newsom, requires companies that make web browsers to offer users an opt-out \"signal\" that automatically tells websites not to share or sell their personal information as they browse.\n\nIt will likely be easier for companies to roll out the service for the entire country, rather than for users only in California.\n\n\"It's such a trivial implementation,\" said Emory Roane, associate director of policy at Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, an organization that pushed for the legislation. \"It's really not that difficult technically.\"\n\nThe legislation, a first of its kind in the country, was sponsored by the California Privacy Protection Agency, the state's consumer privacy watchdog, as well as several consumer advocacy and privacy rights groups.\n\nUnder the law, browsers like Google's Chrome and Microsoft's Edge will have until the beginning of 2027 to create a way for consumers to select the signal. Combined with recent changes from other states, the new law could be a tipping point in how web traffic is treated in the United States.\n\n\"We expect it to have a national impact,\" Roane said.\n\nCalifornia already offers privacy protections under the California Consumer Privacy Act, including a right to opt out from having their information sold.\n\nBut advocates for the new law point out this still puts the burden on the consumer to navigate to web pages and individually select web pages to opt out from. The new tool will effectively automate that process, giving consumers a single toggle to keep their data protected.\n\n\"I would argue if you have to go to every individual website and click the link saying you 'don't want your information sold or shared,' that's not really a meaningful privacy right,\" said Caitriona Fitzgerald, deputy director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, another organization that pressed for AB 566.\n\nAlready, some browser makers have voluntarily offered similar settings under a framework called the Global Privacy Control. Mozilla's Firefox, for example, includes a setting called \"tell websites not to sell or share your data.\" With that setting on, the browser communicates to sites that the visitor wants the site to respect the user's preference.\n\nSeveral states, including Texas and New Jersey, have moved to force companies to respect such preferences, and California's attorney general has even taken legal action against businesses that fail to do so.\n\nBut until now, browsers haven't been required to offer a setting that uses the Global Privacy Control or another standard to communicate users' preferences. \"There are browser extensions but those aren't very widely used,\" said Nick Doty, senior technologist at the Center for Democracy and Technology.\n\nSince it would likely be burdensome for companies to carve out a way to only allow the signal to be used by Californians, according to experts, the tool will likely be available across the country. How, exactly, that will look still remains to be seen. The legislation doesn't require browser makers to use a specific standard. (Spokespeople for Google and Microsoft declined to comment on the companies' plans.)\n\nThere's still a risk that some websites may try to detect which state a visitor is from, and only respect the signal if they find the visitor is from a state that mandates it.\n\nThis is legally risky, though, according to Roane, who points out that AB 566 applies to residents of California, regardless of whether they're using the web from California.\n\n\"If I'm safe saying I'm a resident and you're assuming I'm not and you're flagrantly not respecting my privacy wishes, that is a violation of the law,\" Roane said.\n\nThe law didn't get across the finish line without friction. As CalMatters reported in September, despite not being publicly against the legislation, Google organized opposition to the bill through a group it backs financially.\n\nAB 566 also wasn't the first attempt at such legislation. Newsom vetoed a similar, but slightly more expansive, version of the bill in 2024.\n\nBut now that the door is open, some advocates say they are going to continue to push to further expand privacy preferences.\n\nRoane notes that legislation could be drafted that requires connected smart devices to offer an opt-out preference, or for vehicles that gather data on drivers to respect opt-out preference requests.\n\n\"We are finally, finally starting to have real privacy rights,\" Roane said, \"but we're far away from them being really easy to exercise across the country and across the border and even in states like California where we have these rights.\"",

    "title": "Biggest winners and losers of California's redistricting war",
    "body": "Here are the biggest winners and losers from an unusually early night's results:\n\nGavin Newsom: Initial polling suggested voters were skeptical about the break from independent redistricting. But the Democratic governor took a calculated risk, as he has often before in his career (see gay marriage). Newsom and his advisers succeeded in framing the contest on their own terms -- as part of an existential fight for democracy and a chance to check on Trump's power. Newsom's victory adds fuel to his likely 2028 presidential campaign and has boosted his popularity among Democrats looking for a fighter.\n\nHakeem Jeffries and Nancy Pelosi: The former speaker and her would-be heir to the speaker's gavel went all-in for Prop 50. Pelosi raised tens of millions of dollars while the Jeffries-aligned House Majority PAC poured in $16 million. Now, Democrats have a better shot at retaking control of the House next year, bolstering the odds that Jeffries will be the next speaker. And Pelosi -- who might soon announce her retirement, as is widely expected -- would leave Congress with another major victory on the board.\n\nTexas Democrats: Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and Republican state lawmakers steamrolled Democrats with their new congressional map. But Democratic lawmakers from the Lonestar State played a central supporting role in helping Newsom build the groundwork of Prop 50. Several, including Rep. Jasmine Crockett, traveled the country to help raise money for Prop 50 and other redistricting pushes in deep-blue states. They fought fire with fire.\n\nLabor unions: Organized labor was the financial muscle of the Yes on Prop 50 campaign from the get-go. Major unions representing teachers, nurses and carpenters, among others, wrote seven-figure checks in support of the effort. Other megadonors, including many billionaire tech CEOs, sat out the effort. But labor, by contrast, showed they're still a cornerstone of Democratic power in California.\n\nCalifornia's political economy: Supporters and opponents of Prop 50 raised nearly $172 million combined as they blanketed the airwaves and filled voters' mailboxes with ads -- a boon to the political professionals who benefited from an unexpected, off-year contest.\n\nRELATED: \"Inside the Newsom strategy that passed redistricting and beat Trump back in California\" by Melanie Mason and Jeremy B. White\n\nLOSERS\n\nKevin McCarthy: The former House speaker sought early to calm his former congressional colleagues' nerves, pledging to use the storied fundraising acumen and network he once wielded to rake in nine figures for the No campaign. He never came close to those numbers, frustrating members of his party.\n\nCharles Munger Jr.: The wealthy independent redistricting champion did pony up the $30 million-plus that he discussed giving as far back as August, but it ultimately went to waste. Now the money is gone, the state's map drawing panel will be devoid of power for years, and a national gerrymandering war is left in its stead.\n\nCalifornia House Republicans: The five members targeted by the new map have the most to lose: Reps. Kevin Kiley, Doug LaMalfa, Darrell Issa, Ken Calvert and David Valadao. But even some of the state's other four House Republicans could face real threats. If Kiley challenges Rep. Tom McClintock, McClintock would suddenly have a tougher, more expensive race on his hands despite keeping a safe red district. The same will be true for Rep. Young Kim, who could have to run against Calvert or even Issa if either of them guns for her redrawn Orange County district, which just became safer. Calvert is \"strongly considering\" running against Kim in the new 40th District, according to a person close to Calvert granted anonymity to discuss the deliberations.\n\nDonald Trump: The president may well win the redistricting war given the hurdles facing blue states and the commitments from red ones to gerrymander. But California's effort is expected to cost the GOP seats, even if Democrats don't manage to flip all five they're focused on. If pickups in California help Democrats retake the House next year, the president will be left without a Republican trifecta for the rest of his term.\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger: It's not just that one the former governor's political legacies, the independent commission, will now be powerless for years. It's that the whole brand of moderate politics Schwarzenegger embodies continues to suffer. The national gerrymandering war, and his home state's role in it, are just another reminder of the hyperpartisanship that has placed Schwarzenegger on a political island.\n\nThe \"good government\" crowd: Anti-gerrymandering absolutists who forwarded the \"two wrongs don't make a right\" argument were unsuccessful in bringing voters to their side. Worse for them, the coalition of independent map drawing advocates was fractured in the process, most notably when Common Cause declined to oppose Prop 50 -- after which several members of California Common Cause's advisory board left the organization.\n\nThis reporting first appeared in California Playbook.

    "title": "'The View': Sunny Hostin Says Gavin Newsom 'Laid Out the Map for the Gerrymander Battle' Against GOP, and Dems 'Really Need to Pay Attention'",
    "body": "Prop 50 passed on Tuesday night, marking another win for Democrats in the 2025 elections\n\nAmong the many victories Democrats saw on Tuesday night was the passing of Prop 50 in California and, according to \"The View\" host Sunny Hostin, Democrats in other states \"really need to pay attention to it\" if they want to be successful in future elections.\n\nCalifornians voted in favor of the amendment, which allows temporary changes to Congressional district maps as a response to partisan redistricting in Texas. Where Texas gerrymandered to secure five additional House seats, California picked up the same amount.\n\n\"I think that Democrats really need to pay attention to what Gavin Newsom did,\" Hostin said. \"He laid out the map for the gerrymander battle.\"\n\nThe ABC host was quick to point out that North Carolina and Missouri each took additional seat recently, thanks to similar plays, while Ohio took two. So, in his speech on Tuesday night, Newsom called for New York, Illinois and Colorado to introduce similar legislation to voters, to \"meet this moment head-on.\"\n\n\"And I hope the Democrats do it,\" Hostin said.\n\nWhen host Joy Behar argued that California's gerrymandering in response to Texas was simply \"tit for tat,\" Hostin pushed back, citing the potential fallout.\n\n\"It's not tit for tat Joy, because it's very important, because Donald Trump is tasking red states to basically steal the House,\" she said.\n\nHost Sara Haines conceded that, in this case, the gerrymandering was called for, but warned that in future cases, the \"pendulum\" swing of parties doing something because their opponents did it may not benefit everyone (Haines pointed to Trump's call to end the filibuster this week as an example).\n\nAt that, host Ana Navarro chimed in, wondering how else the Democrats could really take on Republican gerrymandering.\n\n\"Republicans started it, and I don't know how Democrats can just be there, like, with their hands down while they're getting beaten up,\" she said.",

    "title": "California Strikes Back in the Redistricting War",
    "body": "In July, as Republicans in Texas were pushing, at President Donald Trump's behest, to change the state's maps to net themselves as many as five more U.S. House seats in next year's midterms, Gavin Newsom, the Democratic governor of California, warned that his state might feel compelled to respond in kind. \"This is not a bluff,\" he said. In fact, it was -- or, at least, it had been at first. A month before Newsom's pronouncement, as Politico has since reported, a senior House Democrat asked Paul Mitchell, the top redistricting consultant in California, whether a tit-for-tat would be feasible. Mitchell was skeptical, not least because the state had transferred responsibility for its congressional maps to an independent commission that was popular with voters. Nonetheless, Mitchell was dispatched to tour Texas media and \"blabber about how easy it's going to be for California to redraw our districts,\" he told me. \"We were trying to bluff the state that thinks they invented bluffing.\"\n\nOver time, things got more serious. Texas rammed through its maps, even as Democrats in the state legislature absconded in an attention-grabbing, yet ultimately unsuccessful, attempt to deny quorum. Meanwhile, in California, Mitchell dug into the data and discovered not only that it would be possible to retaliate by drawing five friendlier districts for Democrats but that voters just might approve of the plan. And so Newsom and his allies teed up a ballot measure -- known as Proposition 50, or the Election Rigging Response Act -- that would ask Californians to sanction a temporary revision of the state's congressional lines, with the proviso that the independent commission would kick back in after 2030. Opponents of the proposition got a boost when the former governor Arnold Schwarzenegger -- the godfather, to mix movie metaphors, of the independent commission -- warned that \"two bad behaviors don't make a right behavior.\" But the \"No\" campaign ended up outgunned. Good-government groups that typically oppose partisan redistricting stayed on the sideline; former President Barack Obama got off of it to support Prop 50, despite his own past advocacy for nonpartisan mapmaking. On Tuesday, the polls closed, and the measure's victory was called almost immediately. \"We stood firm in response to Donald Trump's recklessness,\" Newsom said. \"After poking the bear, this bear roared.\"\n\nAs Texas and California made their moves, the redistricting war spread across the nation. Initially, it looked as though Republicans, who currently enjoy a razor-thin 219-213 majority in the House -- not counting an Arizona Democrat who has yet to be seated, after winning a special election in September -- would have more opportunities to create favorable seats. Democrats, in the states they control, appeared hamstrung by a combination of institutional constraints, a lack of political will to circumvent them, and maps that were already disproportionately blue, making it hard to squeeze out further advantage. Last week, for instance, the leader of the Maryland Senate rejected a push to redraw the state's sole Republican seat, citing both legal difficulties and philosophical opposition. (This week, Maryland's governor, Wes Moore, pressed ahead, but it's not yet clear how he'll overcome the Senate-shaped obstacle.)",

    "title": "CA GOP sues Newsom over Prop. 50, claims Latinos illegally favored in...",
    "body": "The California Republican Party filed a federal lawsuit Tuesday challenging the state's new congressional district maps, alleging Democrats illegally used race as the primary factor in redrawing boundaries to favor Latino voters.\n\nThe complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, seeks to invalidate Proposition 50, which voters approved on Tuesday to implement legislature-drawn maps for the 2026, 2028 and 2030 elections.\n\nNeither Gov. Gavin Newsom's office nor Secretary of State Shirley Weber's office responded to The Post's requests for comment.\n\nThe lawsuit names both officials in their official capacities as defendants responsible for implementing the challenged maps.\n\nPlaintiffs, including 19 residents, argue the redistricting violates the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection Clause and the 15th Amendment's protections against racial discrimination in voting.\n\n\"The California Legislature violated the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to the Constitution when it drew new congressional district lines based on race, specifically to favor Hispanic voters, without cause or evidence to justify it,\" the complaint states.\n\nThe plaintiffs are represented by attorneys from Dhillon Law Group, a San Francisco-based firm founded by prominent Republican attorney Harmeet K. Dhillon.\n\nThe lawsuit targets 16 congressional districts across California, from the Central Valley to Los Angeles and San Diego counties.\n\nCalifornia lawmakers approved the redistricting package in less than four days in August, suspending multiple procedural rules to expedite passage. The move replaced maps drawn by the state's independent Citizens Redistricting Commission in 2021 following the 2020 census.\n\nDemocratic leadership issued press releases announcing the new map \"retains and expands Voting Rights Act districts that empower Latino voters\" and creates districts designed to help Latino voters \"elect their candidates of choice.\"\n\nPaul Mitchell, the consultant who drew the challenged maps, acknowledged in public statements that race guided his work. According to the complaint, Mitchell said his \"number one thing\" was drawing a \"Latino majority/minority district\" in Los Angeles and creating a \"Latino-influenced district\" with 35% Latino voting age population.\n\nMitchell was paid by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, according to campaign finance disclosures cited in the lawsuit.\n\nThe plaintiffs request the court convene a three-judge panel, as required for constitutional challenges to statewide redistricting. They seek declaratory judgment that the maps violate the Constitution and injunctions blocking their implementation.\n\nNewsom's vanity project vote paved the way for Democrats to flip five crucial congressional seats in the 2026 midterms, coasting to victory with more than 64% -- or 4.4 million voters -- saying yes to redistricting, compared to 35% who voted against it. The Associated Press called the results promptly at 8 p.m. local time.\n\nFlanked by his wife, Jennifer Siebel Newsom, the Golden State governor wasted no time bashing President Trump in his victory speech.\n\n\"We're proud of the work that the people of the state of California did tonight to send a powerful message to a historic president,\" he said. \"Donald Trump is a historic president. He is the most historically unpopular president in modern history.\"\n\nThe partisan measure, spearheaded by Newsom, was introduced by the Democrat-led Legislature in direct response to GOP-driven redistricting in Texas that also aims at gaining five additional congressional seats.",

    "title": "Republicans respond to Proposition 50's success in California in all the wrong ways",
    "body": "California voters gave Gov. Gavin Newsom the green light to redraw the state's congressional maps. The response from GOP leaders is a hypocritical mess.\n\nAfter Texas Republicans redrew their state's congressional district map to give Republicans five additional U.S. House seats, Democrats in California decided they had little choice but to respond in kind. They could not, however, simply approve a gerrymandered map of their own, because state law prohibits such tactics.\n\nTo succeed, Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom and his allies would need voters' permission to create an exception to state law. The result was Proposition 50, and as my MSNBC colleague Allison Detzel explained, it was a triumph for its proponents.\n\nThe results were lopsided: Based on the latest vote tally, roughly 64% of Californians voted in support of the ballot measure, while only 36% opposed it.\n\nDemocrats already control 43 of the Golden State's 52 seats. Once the new map is approved, that total will be on track to reach 48 of the 52 seats.\n\nSeveral hours before the polls closed in California, Donald Trump wrote online that the redistricting effort was \"unconstitutional\" (a word he routinely applies to stuff he doesn't like), before adding that the voting process was \"RIGGED.\" The president concluded that the process \"is under very serious legal and criminal review,\" which sounds very much like a hollow threat.\n\nSoon after, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt insisted that there was \"fraud\" in the election, and when pressed for evidence, the president's chief spokesperson added that her baseless claim is \"just a fact\" -- because she said so.\n\nThe morning after Prop 50's landslide win, House Speaker Mike Johnson went further, calling the voters' verdict a \"tragedy,\" before condemning Newsom's \"immoral leadership\" and California Democrats' willingness to \"rig the system to win.\"\n\nSo when Republicans engage in mid-decade redistricting abuses in Texas, Missouri and North Carolina and take steps to ensure GOP victories long before voters have the chance to cast ballots, that's fine. When Democrats respond in kind, that's \"unconstitutional,\" \"fraudulent,\" \"tragic\" and evidence of a party indifferent to propriety.\n\nIt's helpful when Republican leaders clarify their position on matters like these for the public.",

    "title": "Fox News Voter Poll: California voters OK congressional redistricting plan",
    "body": "'Fox News @ Night' panelists discuss California voters passing the congressional redistricting proposition.\n\nCalifornia voters gave the green light to Proposition 50, which allows the state to redraw its congressional map to counteract a redistricting plan in the state of Texas. It will be in effect for the next three congressional election cycles and is expected to add Democratic seats to California's 52-seat delegation, only nine of which are currently held by Republicans.\n\nIt is a big win for California's Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, and for the state's Democratic Party.\n\nNot all the news is good, though, when it comes to specific issues facing the state or even whether Californians want to see their governor run for president.\n\nAccording to preliminary results from the Fox News Voter Poll, on the redistricting question itself, Golden State voters who backed redrawing the maps overwhelmingly said they did so to counteract changes made by Republicans in other states, rather than because they think it is the best way to draw congressional districts.\n\nIn contrast, the much smaller number who voted \"No\" said they did so because they do not think it is the best way to draw congressional districts, as opposed to being motivated to stop Democrats from gaining more seats in Congress.\n\nMeanwhile, the vast majority of voters generally think a nonpartisan commission should draw the districts, as opposed to the party in power - which is ironic in that such a commission is exactly what is being preempted by today's vote.\n\nWhen asked how they generally feel about states redrawing their congressional districts in response to how other states have drawn theirs, most California voters oppose the idea - again, unusual seeing as that is exactly what they voted for with Proposition 50.\n\nMore than half of Golden Staters approve of the job Newsom is doing as governor.\n\nYet as to whether Newsom should run for president in 2028, more than half said it's not a good idea.\n\nEven so, he outperforms former Vice President Kamala Harris on this measure, as these California special election voters would prefer she sticks to the sidelines - by more than two to one.\n\nWas President Donald Trump a factor in Prop 50's success? The president remains deeply unpopular in the state, with close to two-thirds disapproving of the job he is doing.\n\nHalf of those casting a ballot said they did so specifically to show their opposition to him.\n\nNORTHERN CALIFORNIA VOTERS WEIGH IN ON PROP 50 REDISTRICTING FIGHT\n\nMeanwhile, California voters reject Trump's immigration enforcement policies, with more than six in ten saying they've gone too far.\n\nA similar number oppose sending the National Guard into U.S. cities.\n\nAnd these voters who oppose Trump and his policies also overwhelmingly supported Prop 50 - in some instances by more than nine to one. It might be pointed out, however, that Trump lost California by more than 20 points in 2024, and his disapproval ratings could be exaggerated among voters in this special electorate.\n\nDespite all their negative feelings toward Trump, all is not candy and rainbows for how Californians see things at home.\n\nThe economy was by far their top issue, yet the view of the Golden State economy is not so golden, as more than six in ten said the state economy is in \"not good\" or poor shape.\n\nCALIFORNIA FARMERS PUSH BACK ON PROP 50 AS DEMOCRATS EYE NEW HOUSE MAP\n\nThe vast majority - close to nine in ten - also say their family financial situation is either holding steady or falling behind. Only about one in ten feel they are getting ahead.\n\nPlus, more than eight in ten lamented California's cost of living as unaffordable.\n\nAnother eight in 10 said crime is a problem.\n\nHowever, worried Californians are, they are equally perturbed by the state of the nation.\n\nMore than seven in 10 said they are unhappy about how things are going in the U.S., with close to half angry about the direction the country is heading.\n\nMore than nine in ten said they are concerned about political violence in the U.S.\n\nThese concerns appear to play out in the vote to redraw the congressional map, with more than nine in ten who said it is important to them which party controls Congress.\n\nBlack voters, young voters, Hispanics and college graduates were among those most inclined to back Prop 50, while those most likely to oppose it included voters with no college degree, voters ages 65 and over, and independents.\n\nCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP",

Gavin Newsom gloated over Democrats' big election night with a crudely edited video of him giving President Trump a pro wrestling smackdown, along with other AI-powered images depicting the commander in chief as a cranky baby.\n\nContinuing his shtick of trying to emulate Trump's freewheeling social media style, Newsom included a clip of himself and former President Barack Obama bludgeoning the sitting president in the WWE ring.\n\n\"Now that's what we call a takedown,\" Newsom crowed on his official X account alongside the wild video.\n\nThe fanciful clip also featured House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY), aka \"The Dominator,\" body-slamming Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.), despite the fact that the House won't be up for grabs until next year.\n\nSen. Alex Padilla (D-Calif.) was also seen tossing White House deputy chief of staff for policy Stephen Miller, while \"Squad\" Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) knocked around border czar Tom Homan.\n\nTrump himself, a member of the WWE Hall of Fame, has posted similar wrestling spoofs in the past.\n\nLast month, the president dropped a deepfake clip of him flying a fighter jet and dumping feces on lefty protesters at \"No Kings\" demonstrations. Prior to that, he released a clip superimposing a sombrero on Jeffries' head as the government careened toward a record setting shutdown.\n\nNewsom's digital chest-thumping comes on the heels of California voters passing his Proposition 50 ballot initiative, which will redraw the congressional map to include five additional Democrat-leaning districts to counter GOP redistricting efforts in other states.\n\n\"What a night for the Democratic Party -- a party that is in its ascendancy, a party that's on its toes, no longer on its heels,\" the governor proclaimed late Tuesday.\n\nDemocrats also racked up victories in the New Jersey and Virginia gubernatorial races, expanded their majority in the Virginia House of Delegates, retained their majority on the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, and even won statewide office in Georgia.\n\nThe strong showing has given Democrats a renewed sense of optimism following their electoral dubbing last year.\n\nNewsom's montage also included an AI clip of Trump weeping while wearing a red hat saying \"Newsom was right about everything.\"\n\nIn addition to the videos, the California governor used his official press account to drop bizarre AI images depicting him feeding a baby Trump, putting a pacifier in baby Trump's mouth, and pushing a baby Trump around in a stroller.\n\n\"The whole expression was to not allow it to be normalized. It was becoming normalized,\" Newsom told NBC's \"Meet the Press\" last week explaining his social media antics.",

    "title": "'The results stunned him': How pollster convinced Gavin Newsom to make massive gamble",
    "body": "California Governor Gavin Newsom looks on as he attends an event, to announce the Golden State Literacy Plan and deployment of literacy coaches statewide, at the Clinton Elementary School in Compton, California, U.S. June 5, 2025. REUTERS/Daniel Cole\n\nThe California redistricting ballot measure passed Tuesday with overwhelming support, but sources who worked on the campaign say it started off looking like a dangerous gamble.\n\nPolitico spoke to more than 20 campaign strategists, politicians, activists and others involved with Proposition 50 about the decision to roll the dice on a measure that started with just 38 percent support for Gov. Gavin Newsom's plan for allowing the legislature to redraw the state's congressional maps.\n\n\"A loss here would reverberate well beyond Sacramento: Trump could point to California -- the state that sued, defied and mocked him -- as proof that even a blue-state bulwark was no match for his drive to rejigger the midterm playing field, while Newsom would own a massive whiff against his favorite foil,\" Politico reported. \"It would be the Fox News chyron Democrats most fear: 'TRUMP BEATS CALIFORNIA.'\"\n\nThe plan started off as a bluff to force Texas Republicans to back down on their own plan, pushed by President Donald Trump, to redraw their own maps to rig next year's midterms in favor of GOP candidates, and that initial poll warned of a humiliating loss for Newsom and a potential drag on Democratic congressional candidates - but it turns out they were simply asking the wrong question.\n\n\"Paul Mitchell, a data expert who was busily fashioning new district maps for the congressional delegation, had put his own poll in the field,\" Politico reported. \"He tested a hypothetical ballot measure that would hand redrawing power back to the Legislature but he, in his words, 'wrapped the redistricting in a reform burrito' -- adding language that emphasized the effort would be temporary and only apply if Texas redrew its maps while affirming California's support for national nonpartisan redistricting.\"\n\n\"The results stunned him,\" the report added. \"Nearly 80 percent of respondents supported independent redistricting and, two questions later, roughly the same number backed new, politically-motivated maps.\"\n\nMitchell is not a member of the governor's inner circle, so he showed his results to longtime Newsom pollster David Binder, and the governor's team added another crucial change by putting the proposed maps themselves on the ballot.\n\n\"With the modified proposal in place, Binder conducted a second poll where the measure got 52 percent support -- a marked improvement from the sub-40 percent result earlier that month,\" Politico reported. \"For many Democratic voters, reservations that 'two wrongs don't make a right' were suddenly subsumed by a hunger to sock it to the president.\"\n\nAnother senior Newsom adviser, Sean Clegg, added a final touch - having the Legislature designate the measure as Proposition 50 - that proved highly effective in getting the measure approved.\n\n\"A ready-made campaign slogan -- A yes vote on Prop 50 would protect elections 'in all 50 states' -- was now enshrined in law,\" Politico reported. \"It was the earliest glimpse of the nationalization strategy that would undergird every piece of campaign messaging.\"",

    "title": "GOP urges Democrat governor to deploy National Guard to Charlotte as crime surges",
    "body": "California Gov. Gavin Newsom threatened to sue the Trump administration if it sends National Guard troops to San Francisco. (via Gavin Newsom/X)\n\nCiting frustrations with persistent crime, a trio of North Carolina lawmakers is urging Democratic Gov. Josh Stein to deploy the National Guard in Charlotte, saying the state of the city has become \"increasingly dire.\"\n\n\"Recently, the city faced eight homicides in seven days. The murder rate in uptown Charlotte is now 200% higher than it was a year ago,\" the letter states. \"According to the Fraternal Order of Police, aggravated assaults involving knives or guns have risen from 86 in 2024 to 111 in 2025, and personal strong-arm robberies have increased from 26 to 31 in the same period.\"\n\nRep. Mark Harris, R-N.C., one of the letter's authors, said the request doesn't just come from the state's congressional delegation.\n\n\"This is not just my idea. This is the Fraternal Order of Police that had come, saying that they believed this is important and asking the governor and mayor to step up and do it,\" Harris said, alluding to a similar letter published by Charlotte-Mecklenburg law enforcement earlier this year.\n\nMAJOR CITY POLICE UNIONS SUPPORT FEDERAL TROOP DEPLOYMENTS, BUT LOCAL LEADERS ARE PUSHING BACK\n\nThe letter's three signatories, Harris, Rep. Pat Harrigan and Rep. Chuck Edwards, all represent the Charlotte area.\n\nThe North Carolina letter comes as President Donald Trump has used the National Guard to bring attention to crime in cities like Washington, D.C., Memphis, Chicago and others. So far, the administration has deployed the National Guard to six urban areas and floated deployments in another five -- even as courts weigh the use of federal troops to address domestic crime.\n\nThe letter from the North Carolina lawmakers pointed to those deployments as a template for success.\n\n\"Other cities have deployed the National Guard and seen positive results. In Washington, D.C., when President Trump deployed troops under his lawful authority, the city promptly saw a reduction in crime, including twelve consecutive days without a single homicide,\" the letter states.\n\nThat's also the thinking of members of the House Republican Conference leadership. Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., called it a continuation of the administration's work. Scalise serves the conference as majority leader -- the No. 2 Republican in the chamber.\n\n\"Millions of Americans don't feel safe in many once-great cities, and President Trump is working with House Republicans to change that. As we've seen in D.C. and Memphis, President Trump took decisive action, cleaned up our streets, and made those cities safer,\" Scalise said.\n\n\"I commend my colleagues from North Carolina for calling out the violent crime in Charlotte and working to make the city safer for residents and visitors, and encourage more leaders to do the same,\" he added.\n\nMEMPHIS RESIDENTS SPLIT OVER NATIONAL GUARD DEPLOYMENT TO FIGHT CITY'S CRIME\n\nAccording to the Charlotte Police Department's quarterly statistics report, violent crimes, commercial burglaries and larcenies from automobiles have all gone up in Charlotte since last year. But other crimes like homicides, rapes, property crimes and arson have come down modestly from levels in 2024. In many categories, Charlotte's current crime levels are meaningfully lower than rates in 2022 and 2023, with some exceptions.\n\nHarris thinks they could go lower.\n\nHe doesn't envision the National Guard deployment as a long-term solution to fighting crime. Instead, Harris believes the increased law enforcement presence could create an opening for the local police force to find their footing.\n\n\"What I hope comes out of it is that in that time, the police are able to go after whoever these bad guys are, that are threatening this environment of crime. And then, at the end of the day, it's going to create a hope, an outcry from the public that says, 'We're not going to accept our crime-ridden city anymore.'\"\n\nWhen asked what needs to change to make Charlotte's safety a constant, with or without the National Guard, Harris said the city needs to prioritize its policies and resources on keeping violent offenders off the streets.\n\n\"After the murder of Iryna Zarutska, it brought to light a real issue with not keeping criminals behind bars,\" Harris said, referring to the 23-year-old Ukrainian refugee who was stabbed to death on a Charlotte train.\n\nCHARLOTTE CITY COUNCIL MEMBER CALLS OUT 'PAPER-THIN' CRIME STATISTICS AFTER UKRAINIAN REFUGEE'S KILLING\n\n\"In her case, the guy had been arrested 14 times, been put out on the street. These are things that have a lot of issues to be addressed. That's a judiciary issue.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAlthough past efforts to deploy the National Guard have been met with protest from Democratic governors in other states, Harris hopes that Stein will work with the Trump administration as needed if it becomes clear a deployment is needed.\n\nStein's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

    "title": "Trump Acknowledges Election Results Weren't 'Good' For Republicans",
    "body": "Speaking ahead of a breakfast with GOP senators on Wednesday, President Donald Trump conceded that Tuesday's elections did not go well for his party, while noting that the group would discuss how the ongoing government shutdown -- now the longest in history -- affected Republicans' outcome at the polls. (Watch video above.)\n\n\"I don't think it was good for Republicans,\" Trump said of the election results. \"I'm not sure it was good for anybody.\"\n\nIndeed, Republicans had a bad night, losing the gubernatorial races in Virginia and New Jersey, while a ballot initiative promoted by California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) to fight back against Trump's mid-decade redistricting effort was overwhelmingly approved by voters in the state.\n\nStill, Trump said Election Day was \"interesting\" and \"we learned a lot.\"\n\n\"I thought we'd have a discussion after the press leaves about what last night represented and what we should do about it, and also about the shutdown and how that relates to last night,\" he said. \"I think if you read the pollsters, the shutdown was a big factor, negative for the Republicans, and that was a big factor, and they say that I wasn't on the ballot was the biggest factor.\"\n\nHis comments echoed a post he made on his Truth Social platform on Tuesday evening, making excuses for the Republican Party's poor showing, once it became clear Democrats delivered a strong performance, indicating they are on track to potentially retake control of the House of Representatives in next year's elections.\n\nDespite Trump's claims, however, early exit polls showed that many people viewed their vote as a message of opposition to his administration, according to CNN.\n\nTrump urged Republicans to abolish the filibuster -- the Senate's custom for requiring most legislation to meet a 60-vote threshold before it can pass -- a move that most GOP members in the upper chamber are firmly opposed to, framing it as the \"only way\" to end the government shutdown.\n\n\"It's time for Republicans to do what they have to do, and that's terminate the filibuster,\" he said. \"If you don't terminate the filibuster, you'll be in bad shape. We won't pass any legislation.\"\n\nDemocrats have said they will not vote to reopen the government until Republicans agree to extend enhanced subsidies for millions of people enrolled in the Affordable Care Act, a demand that the GOP refused to grant, prompting the extended government shutdown, which is now in its 36th day. Democratic leaders on Wednesday renewed their demand for a meeting with Trump and their Republican counterparts.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump made no reference to the victory of democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani, who is projected to win the New York City mayoral race. The president previously railed against the 34-year-old, endorsing his main rival, former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo.",

    "body": "During MSNBC's Election Night coverage on Tuesday, Rep. Robert Garcia (D-CA) said that California Gov. Gavin Newsom's (D) work to pass Proposition 50 has made it so that \"not only are we likely to flip these five seats, he's actually strengthened additional tossup seats that will now move into the Democratic column.\"\n\nGarcia said, \"I've just got to say, this would not have been possible without Gov. Newsom. He raised the resources. He worked with the delegation. He got this through the legislature. He campaigned across the state. He built a coalition, not just here in California, but one that included people from across the country supporting this proposition. And so, I have to, again, say that he is, right now, the model of what a Democrat in the fight is all about, and he's been a great leader on this. We all thank him immensely. And I think the country owes him also a huge thank you for the work to ensure that, not only are we likely to flip these five seats, he's actually strengthened additional tossup seats that will now move into the Democratic column. So, a great night for California Democrats, but also a great night to win the House back in 2026.\"\n\nHe added, \"Trump is the one that called the governor of Texas and said, find me five more seats. And so, our Governor did the right thing and the courageous thing and stepped up and said, if you're going to respond this way, we're going to respond with the same level of aggressiveness that meets this actual moment that we're in.\"",

    "title": "The Night Democrats Finally Stopped Losing",
    "body": "This was not just an off-year election. It was a circuit-breaker that finally ended 2024, the party's annus horribilis.\n\n\"What a night for the Democratic Party,\" Gov. Gavin Newsom declared after his redistricting ballot measure was called so quickly that some California voters were still waiting in line to vote for the measure. \"A party that is in its ascendancy, a party that is on its toes, no longer on its heels.\"\n\nIt wasn't just that Democrats won every closely-watched election -- it's that their victories were so sweeping. An expected victory in the Virginia governor's race became a 15-point landslide, a gubernatorial race thought to be closer in New Jersey became a 13-point thrashing of its own and that referendum to redraw California's House lines to add more Democratic seats was winning by nearly 30 points.\n\nOn it went down the ballot. Virginia Democrats didn't just add to their paper-thin state house majority, they won 64 seats in a 100-person body. Even in more politically hostile territory, Democrats claimed wins, notably winning a pair of statewide elections in Georgia, where the party has struggled for two decades in non-federal races.\n\nIf the message was in the margins, there was no mystery in the why. Voters are, again, unhappy with the political status quo and, again, fault a White House they see as unfocused on their priorities. And Trump isn't just failing to address the cost of living -- many voters see him as abusing his power.\n\nFour years ago, voters offered an early rebuke of Biden by electing a GOP Virginia governor, and a Democratic congresswoman from the state spoke for many in her party by telling a reporter the following day that \"nobody elected him to be FDR.\" The White House and Democratic Congress got the message and swiftly passed the stalled infrastructure bill out of the House, a recognition that the party needed tangible accomplishments rather than every inch of Biden's ambitious agenda.\n\nYet even with that same outspoken Virginia Democrat, Abigail Spanberger, winning the governorship in convincing fashion, it's unlikely today's Republicans will apply the same pressure on their White House. They fear Trump, and few dare publicly rebut the preposterous idea pushed by some of the president's apologists Tuesday that the party's problems can be solved by nominating only full-throated MAGA adherents. (Democrats in purple and blue America would love nothing more.)\n\nThe better test may be whether Republican lawmakers, in Washington and state capitals, mount a quiet protest and shelve Trump's demands that they redraw their House boundaries before next year's midterm elections. It was swallowed by Tuesday's electoral results, but earlier in the day, Kansas Republicans decided to forgo a special session to eliminate their state's sole Democratic-held district.\n\nWill other red states, their GOP House members suddenly staring down the prospect of a harsh midterm, really want to infuse some of their Republican-held districts with tens of thousands of new liberal voters for the sake of dumping one or two House Democrats?",

    "title": "Passage of Prop. 50 brightens Newsom's national prospects while casting a shadow on Trump",
    "body": "The redistricting maps are temporary, expiring in 2030, when California's independent redistricting commission will resume drawing districts.\n\nCalifornia voters delivered a major victory for Democrats nationwide Tuesday -- and possibly for Gov. Gavin Newsom's political ambitions -- by passing a redistricting plan that could help the party seize as many as five congressional seats in the 2026 midterm elections.\n\nThe ballot measure was seen as a searing denunciation of President Trump and his administration's policies, which have included divisive immigration raids, steep tariffs, cuts to healthcare and a military occupation of Los Angeles.\n\nProposition 50 was launched at warp speed in August in an attempt to counter President Trump's successful attempt to pressure Republican-led states, most notably Texas, to gerrymander their own states to keep Democrats from gaining control of the U.S. House of Representatives after the 2026 midterm elections. If Democrats gain power they could imperil his agenda and launch investigations into his administration.\n\n\"After poking the bear, this bear roared,\" Newsom said Tuesday night shortly after the polls closed and the Associated Press determined Proposition 50 had passed.\n\nNewsom said he was proud of California for standing up to Trump and called on other states with Democrat-controlled legislatures to pass their own redistricting plans.\n\n\"I hope it's dawning on people, the sobriety of this moment,\" he said.\n\nThe president, meanwhile, in a post Tuesday morning on his social media site called the vote \"A GIANT SCAM\" and \"RIGGED\" and said it is \"under very serious legal and criminal review. STAY TUNED!\" The White House did not explain what he meant by \"serious legal and criminal review.\" After the polls closed, Trump again posted, writing enigmatically: \"...AND SO IT BEGINS.\"\n\nNewsom early Tuesday dismissed Trump's threats as \"the ramblings of an old man that knows he's about to LOSE.\"\n\nProposition 50 will change how California determines the boundaries of congressional districts. The measure asked voters to approve new congressional district lines designed to favor Democrats for the 2026, 2028 and 2030 elections, overriding the map drawn by the state's nonpartisan, independent redistricting commission.\n\nThe measure, placed by the ballot by the Democratic-led state Legislature and pushed by Newsom, reconfigured the state's congressional districts in favor of Democrats, shifting five more House districts into competitive or easily winnable territory for Democrats. California has 43 Democrats and nine Republicans in the House; now the number of GOP members could be cut in half.\n\nWhile Newsom and Democratic partisans framed the passage of Proposition 50 -- which they had dubbed the Election Rigging Response Act -- as a major blow against Trump's iron grip on the federal government, it is far from guaranteed to flip the balance of power in the U.S. House, where Republicans hold a slim majority.\n\nFor one, spurred on by Trump, Republican-led states are busy pursuing their own redistricting plans. Several Republican-controlled states including North Carolina, Ohio and Missouri are moving ahead.\n\nWhat's more, California voters in the fall of 2026 would then have to be convinced to choose Democratic challengers over incumbent Republicans in those newly crafted districts -- and many current GOP members of Congress have said they don't plan to go quietly.\n\n\"Here's something Newsom and his cronies don't know: It won't work,\" said Congressman Darrell Issa, a San Diego-area Republican whose seat was targeted by the newly redrawn maps. \"The worst gerrymander in history has a fatal flaw. Voters get to pick their representatives. Not the other way around. I'm not going anywhere.\"\n\nCongressman Doug LaMalfa whose Northern California district was carved up and diluted with left-leaning coastal voters, said he was \"standing in the fight. They're not going to kidnap my district here without a battle.\"\n\nWhat is sure, however, is that Proposition 50 is a big win for Newsom, who has propelled his fight with Trump onto the national political stage as one of the loudest voices standing against the new administration.\n\nCampaigning for Proposition 50, Newsom mocked Trump on the social media site X with sarcastic, Trumpesque all-caps media posts. The governor won viral fame, guest spots on late-night shows and millions of dollars from Democratic donors around the country delighted to see someone jousting with the president. In recent days, Newsom has begun talking openly about a possible run for president in 2028, after telling CBS last month that he would be lying if he tried to pretend he wasn't considering it.\n\nThe new congressional districts also are expected to set off a mad scramble among ambitious Democratic politicians.\n\nAlready, Audrey Denney, a strategist and education director, has announced she will once again mount a campaign against LaMalfa, who represents an area that has been split into two districts saturated with Democratic voters. Former state Sen. Richard Pan, meanwhile, has indicated he intends to target Congressman Kevin Kiley, who saw his hometown of Rocklin yanked out of his district and replaced with parts of more-Democratic Sacramento.\n\nOne of the biggest effects of the measure may be the way it has enraged many of the state's rural voters, and left even those who are registered Democrats feeling as though state leaders don't care about their needs.\n\n\"They think our voices are so small that we don't count, and because we're red,\" fumed Monica Rossman, the chairwoman of the Glenn County Board of Supervisors in rural Northern California. \"This is just one more way of them squeezing us rural people.\"\n\nRossman described Newsom in obscene terms this week and added that \"people from urban areas, they don't realize that us people from One-Taco-Bell-Towns don't know what it's like to drive by a dealership and see nothing but battery-operated vehicles. By traffic, we mean Ted's cows are out again and we have to wait for them to get out of the way. We're going to have people making decisions about areas they know nothing about.\"\n\nBut as they headed to polling places across the state, many voters said the Trump administration's actions in California -- from funding cuts to the prolonged immigration raids -- convinced them that radical measures were necessary.\n\nAdee Renteria, who came to vote at Our Lady of Guadalupe Church in East Los Angeles decked out from head to toe in celebratory Dodgers gear, said she was voting yes on Proposition 50 because \"I want a fricking voice.\"\n\n\"I want our people to be able to walk the streets without getting kidnapped,\" she said, adding that she believed the measure would allow Democrats a chance at fighting back against policies that she said had sown terror in her community.\n\nIn Buena Park, Guarav Jain, 33, said he had braved long lines to cast his ballot \"to prove that we can fight back on the crazy things Trump says.\"\n\n\"This is the first chance to make our voice heard since the [presidential] election last November,\" he added.\n\nThe path to Proposition 50, which ranks as the fourth most expensive ballot measure in California history, began in June. That was when Trump's political team began pushing Texas Republicans to redraw the lines for that state's 38 congressional districts to gain five Republican seats and give his party a better shot at holding the House after the midterm elections.\n\nWhen Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed on to the idea, Newsom jumped in to announce that California, which has 52 representatives, would counter by redrawing its own districts to try to pick up as many as five seats for Democrats.\n\n\"We're giving the American people a fair chance,\" Newsom said in August, adding that California was \"responding to what occurred in Texas.\"\n\nThe move outraged California Republicans and also angered some people, such as former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, who are no fans of Trump. Some opponents argued that it was an affront to an independent congressional redistricting commission that California voters created in 2010 with the passage of Proposition 20 -- an effort to provide fair representation to all Californians.\n\n\"They are trying to fight for democracy by getting rid of the democratic principles of California.... It is insane to let that happen,\" Schwarzenegger said at an event at USC in September. \"Doesn't make any sense to me -- that because we have to fight Trump, to become Trump.\"\n\nBut Schwarzenegger didn't do much to actively campaign against the measure and the No side was far outgunned financially. Proponents raised more than $100 million, according to campaign finance reports, while the No side raised about $43.7 million.\n\nA star-studded cast of Democratic leaders also flooded the airwaves to support the measure, including Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. President Obama spoke on the issue in ads that aired during the World Series. \"Democracy is on the ballot Nov. 4,\" the former president said.\n\nThe new congressional district maps are only temporary. They will be in place for elections next year and in 2028 and 2030. After that, California's independent redistricting commission will resume its duties in drawing the maps.\n\nWhat may be longer lasting, some rural representatives said, is a sense among many in California's heartland that their voices don't count.\n\nLaMalfa, the congressman who saw his deep red district divided into two blue urban areas, said many of his constituents -- who work in farming, timber and ranching -- believe many state policies are \"stacked against them and they have nowhere to go.\"\n\n\"What they do have is a voice that understands their plight and is willing to speak for them. I am one of the people who does that,\" he said. \"You don't have that anymore if you have taken all those folks and just drawn them into urban voters districts.\"",

    "title": "Opinion | Gavin Newsom wasn't on the ballot  --  but Prop 50's passage made him a big winner",
    "body": "By Dan Schnur, former Republican campaign strategist and professor of politics and communications at Berkeley, Pepperdine University and USC\n\nWhile many will focus on Mamdani-mania in New York City and the outcome of high-profile governors races in New Jersey and Virginia, the political event from Tuesday most likely to affect the 2028 presidential election happened on the other side of the country. Passage of California's Proposition 50, the redistricting issue on the state ballot, is poised to provide Democrats with five additional U.S. House seats next year -- helpful in their fight to win back control of Congress -- and to provide a major boost to the presidential prospects of Gov. Gavin Newsom.\n\nThrough his frequent news media appearances and combative social media presence, Newsom has emerged over the past several months as the closest thing the national Democratic Party has to a Trump-slayer, at least right now. But spearheading the fight to counter the presidential-led mid-decade redistricting efforts provided Newsom with a platform that could further enhance his presence as a leader in the 2028 primary field.\n\nAt core, the ballot proposition asked Californians to turn their backs, at least temporarily, on efforts they'd already made to be responsible about redistricting. More than a decade ago, California voters rejected the inherent conflict of interest that allows elected officials of both parties to collude in drawing legislative and congressional boundaries that protect their incumbents from the annoyance of competitive reelection campaigns. In 2008 and 2010, they passed a pair of ballot initiatives that took this power away from the state legislature and granted it to a bipartisan citizens commission.\n\nBut that was a different political era and a much different political landscape. When President Donald Trump encouraged Texas Republicans to redraw their state's congressional districts this summer to protect the GOP's House majority, it created a domino effect: So far, more than a dozen other states have announced plans or taken steps to redraw their own maps. This gradual decline into craven partisanship already affects one-third of the states with more than one congressional district. Ohio became the latest on Friday.\n\nThanks to the two ballot initiatives that Californians passed in a more innocent era, the challenge before Newsom and his allies was to persuade a statewide electorate to reverse their own well-intentioned redistricting reforms. The governor understands his state well enough to know that Californians would be reluctant to undo their own democracy-enhancing handiwork, so he made two savvy political calculations to enhance the prospects for Proposition 50.\n\nThe first was to draft his measure as a temporary suspension that would allow the citizens commission to be back in charge of the regularly scheduled 2030 redistricting -- a point when the specter of Trump presumably will no longer loom. Newsom's second stratagem was to recast a debate over the arcane topic of congressional line-drawing into a fight that deep-blue California would lead against a president the vast majority of the state's voters had opposed in three consecutive presidential elections.\n\nWhile Prop 50 enjoys a sizable lead in the final round of preelection polling, things weren't always so certain. When the redistricting skirmishes began in August, an Emerson College statewide poll showed that one-third of California voters supported the effort, a quarter opposed it and 42% were undecided. But support for the measure grew rapidly after Newsom's immense fundraising efforts created a one-sided debate on Golden State airwaves and screens.\n\nThe anti-Trump clarion significantly heightened Newsom's national profile and allowed him to dramatically enlarge his financial support from out-of-state small donors. Both stand to be of immense benefit in the next presidential election, but in the immediate term, they provided an overwhelming fundraising advantage for the Proposition 50 campaign. In what may be a political first, Newsom actually asked his donors to stop giving money to the campaign, since there was nothing left on which to spend.\n\nNational Republicans had vowed to match the $100 million-plus that Newsom and his allies had pledged to raise, but after the campaign began, they apparently decided that they would rather direct that money to competitive House races around the country next year than risk it on an all-or-nothing initiative fight in a strongly hostile Golden State. They ultimately came through with only a tiny portion of that sum. That left California megadonor and activist Charles Munger Jr. and former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger -- who led the drive for the original reforms and are Prop 50's most high-profile opponents today -- to fight a lonely battle without the national support they had been promised.\n\nTuesday's result is poised to leave the GOP with as few as four U.S. House seats in a 52-member state delegation. California's Republican Party has been a nonfactor for many years, although its legislative leaders have recently achieved some gains by teaming with centrist Democrats on public safety and energy policy. Most state conservatives focus their attention on either national politics or local and legislative campaigns in their remaining bastions of influence. With the passage of Prop 50, their minuscule role in state politics will diminish even further.\n\nNewsom, on the other hand, is just getting started. A Prop 50 victory is not nearly enough to guarantee him the Democratic presidential nomination, but it should give him a seat at the primary table if he so desires -- which he certainly appears to.",

    "title": "After confirming possible White House run, California's Newsom scores a win in fight for US House",
    "body": "LOS ANGELES -- California Gov. Gavin Newsom, eager to raise his national profile as a Democrat willing to aggressively confront President Donald Trump, scored a campaign victory Tuesday that may help his party in the midterms as he moves toward a White House run.\n\nWith Proposition 50, Newsom successfully bet he could persuade California voters to throw out independently drawn U.S. House maps in favor of new districts designed to help Democrats win five more seats.\n\nHis gamble was a response to Trump's redistricting push in Texas, where Republicans hope to pick up five seats of their own. Republicans have made similar moves in other states in an effort to maintain their grip on power for the remainder of Trump's term. Democrats have too, but they have fewer options. Newsom framed the campaign as a near-existential conflict, arguing that democracy was at risk.\n\nThe two-month campaign sprint cemented Newsom's status as one of Trump's leading adversaries at a time when even many Democrats described the party as ineffective and weak.\n\n\"We stood tall and we stood firm in response to Donald Trump's recklessness,\" Newsom said Tuesday. \"After poking the bear, this bear roared.\"\n\nDemocrats are eager for a fighter\n\nThe contest further raised Newsom's profile among activists who are clamoring for Democratic leaders willing to battle Trump, said Celinda Lake, a veteran Democratic pollster and strategist. Newsom can now point to a tangible victory, she said.\n\n\"Democrats think that finally someone's standing up and being creative and thinking outside the box and fighting back,\" Lake said. \"And that's a very strong profile.\"\n\nThe election win comes shortly after Newsom last month confirmed for the first time that he is considering running for president in 2028. He told CBS News he'll make a decision after next year's midterms.\n\n\"Yeah, I'd be lying otherwise,\" Newsom responded when asked if he'd give serious thought to a presidential campaign.\n\nThough the next presidential election is three years away, ambitious Democrats are jockeying for an advantage in a crowded primary field that's already taking shape.\n\n\"He's betting that Democratic primary voters will remember that he was standing as this bulwark against Trump as he's attempting to consolidate power,\" said Sawyer Hackett, a Democratic strategist and commentator. \"And I think that he's right about that.\"\n\nCalifornia is a 'blessing and a curse'\n\nNewsom is nearing his last year in office as California's governor. He can use that time to continue stoking his national profile by fighting back against Trump while working on a vision for the Democratic Party, said Hackett, who managed former cabinet secretary Julian Castro's 2020 presidential campaign.\n\nHe'll face a tangle of ongoing problems that affect not only the quality of life of California residents but the state's image in the rest of the country. They include an ongoing homelessness crisis, high energy bills, a struggling home insurance market, notoriously high taxes and housing costs that have been driving residents out of state in search of affordable living.\n\nVoters last year spurned fellow Californian Kamala Harris, then the sitting vice president.\n\n\"California is a political blessing and a curse,\" said Thad Kousser, a political scientist at University of California, San Diego. \"It rockets you to prominence and comes with the baggage of the state's political stereotypes.\"\n\nA majority of California voters \"strongly\" or \"somewhat\" approve of the way Newsom is handling his job as governor, but support for a Newsom presidential run is lower.\n\nJust over half of California voters said they would not like to see Newsom run for president in 2028, according to the AP Voter Poll, while 45% said they would. That includes some voters who support him generally or share his party: About 2 in 10 voters who approved of Newsom's performance running the state don't want him to seek the Oval Office, and about 3 in 10 Democrats or voters who lean toward the Democratic Party don't want him to run.\n\nThey're even less excited about Harris running again -- about 7 in 10 California voters said they're opposed to her running in 2028.\n\nKalinda Jones, who teaches social work classes at a community college outside Sacramento, said Newsom could be a possible choice for president, but she wasn't enthusiastic about him or any other candidate. Jones supported Proposition 50.\n\n\"I guess right now, he seems like a good option,\" Jones said.\n\nRepublican Dennis Guerrero, a 67-year-old retired salesperson who voted against Proposition 50, said he faults Newsom for his inability to slow the homeless crisis, among other issues.\n\n\"I would not vote for him for president,\" Guerrero said.\n\nNewsom seeks a place on the national stage\n\nThe Proposition 50 fight gave Newsom something else that will be valuable if he decides to run for president -- donors big and small.\n\nNewsom and his allies spent roughly $100 million. His campaign team says he collected 1.2 million contributions and brought in so much money that they asked people to stop giving. Campaign finance records show well over 100,000 donations came from outside California.\n\nNewsom has long sought a more prominent voice on the national stage. As far back as 2022, Newsom was blaming his own party for setbacks in the nation's culture wars, asking at the time, \"Where is the Democratic Party?\"\n\nHe has traveled extensively in recent years, including to crucial early-voting states like South Carolina, and is appearing on television shows and podcasts with national audiences, making some obvious steps toward the political center. He stunned fellow Democrats by holding mostly chummy conversations with prominent conservatives on a new podcast he touted as a way for the party to grapple with the \"Make America Great Again\" movement's popularity and reach out to young men who have soured on the Democratic Party.\n\nMeanwhile, his press office has delighted Democrats and attracted widespread attention by mimicking Trump's bombastic, all-caps social media posts.\n\n\"Newsom is the one Democrat of this generation who has leaned into the culture wars and done quite well with that,\" noted Republican consultant Mike Madrid, a longtime Trump critic. Denting Trump's momentum is \"what the Democratic base has been looking for. They want a fight.\"",

    "title": "A Big Win in California Propels Newsom",
    "body": "At a time when Democrats have been searching for a win against President Trump, Gov. Gavin Newsom of California gave them one.\n\nCalifornia voters on Tuesday overwhelmingly supported Proposition 50, Mr. Newsom's measure to create more Democratic congressional seats, countering a similar redistricting effort pushed by Mr. Trump in other states to protect Republican control of the House next year.\n\nThe result has sharply lifted Mr. Newsom's political profile at a moment when he is considering running for president. And it has provided what many Democrats praised as a road map on how to fight for a party that remains adrift one year after Mr. Trump captured the White House.\n\n\"It shows that he can get stuff done,\" said the chairwoman of the South Carolina Democratic Party, Christale Spain, who hosted Mr. Newsom on a swing through her state in July. She added, \"Democrats want somebody to fight back. He's pushing back and fighting back. That is what is helping him break through.\"\n\nThe election has now freed Mr. Newsom, whose term as governor ends in January 2027, to turn his attention to elevating his presence on the national stage, presenting himself as a leader who scored a high-profile electoral win for Democrats at a bleak moment for the party.\n\nHe is planning to travel the country campaigning on behalf of Democratic congressional candidates. He has a forthcoming memoir to promote. And aides said he is likely to soon pivot to the issue of climate change and cast himself as a climate champion, drawing a contrast with Mr. Trump and his supporters.\n\nThe California results capped an evening of coast-to-coast victories by Democrats, including contests for mayor of New York, governor of Virginia and governor of New Jersey.\n\nThe outcome in California was never preordained. Mr. Newsom took a political risk: He was essentially asking voters to overturn, albeit temporarily, a measure they had passed 15 years ago requiring a nonpartisan commission to draw congressional district lines. He faced opposition from governmental reform groups and Arnold Schwarzenegger, the former governor who had championed that initiative that created the commission. By the end, the opposition had walked off the field and Mr. Newsom's win was so decisive that the race was called as soon as polls closed.\n\nMr. Newsom was in the carriage house of the governor's mansion at that moment, watching returns with about two dozen friends and aides. A big cheer erupted as soon as CNN called the race in his favor, one of his aides said, and then Mr. Newsom headed for the California Democratic Party headquarters, where he addressed news cameras with a somber tone that lacked the typical election night celebrations.\n\nStanding between an American flag and a California flag, Mr. Newsom cast the result as a repudiation of Mr. Trump and a victory for Democrats in California and across the nation.\n\n\"What a night for the Democratic Party -- a party that is in its ascendancy, a party that's on its toes, no longer on its heels,\" the governor said.\n\nThe result marks a decided turn in Mr. Newsom's fortunes. Just 18 months ago, he seemed in danger of being overshadowed by another California Democrat and sometimes-rival, Kamala Harris, the former vice president who had become the Democratic candidate for president after Joseph R. Biden Jr. dropped out of the race.\n\nHe was being disparaged by many leaders on the left for using his podcast to embrace and interview conservative supporters of Mr. Trump, including Charlie Kirk and Steve Bannon. He struck an initially conciliatory stance toward Mr. Trump, again roiling many in his party, going to the airport in Los Angeles to warmly greet the president on the tarmac when he flew there earlier this year to inspect the damage after devastating wildfires.\n\nBut Mr. Newsom began to methodically reposition himself this summer, after Mr. Trump took control of California's National Guard and sent troops into Los Angeles. He began using social media to mimic and mock the president, in the process drawing approval from the left. His championing of Proposition 50 was the highest-profile evidence of his shift.\n\n\"Six months ago, the strategy was to engage with MAGA leaders like Steve Bannon,\" said Eric Jaye, a Democratic consultant in San Francisco who was an adviser to Mr. Newsom when he was mayor of San Francisco. \"With the Proposition 50 victory, Newsom has made himself Donald Trump's chief, and most successful, antagonist, and that is exactly what Democratic primary voters are looking for nationally.\"\n\nThe road ahead is far from easy if he seeks the presidency.\n\nEven his allies say he carries significant political baggage. He's a product of arguably the most liberal state in the country and a promoter of policies that are seen as out-of-touch with many voters. He has a personal style that at least some of his critics argue is slick and off-putting. And the backlash he generated following one incident during the pandemic has never fully subsided. Mr. Newsom attended a birthday dinner for a lobbyist-friend at The French Laundry, one of the most expensive restaurants in the world, and was photographed not wearing a mask, at a moment when he was telling Californians not to gather with their families for Thanksgiving.\n\nThis is a difficult time for California -- struggling with the aftermath of the fires, a housing crisis and what many Republicans denounce as out of control spending -- all of which Mr. Newsom's opponents would seek to have him own in any presidential campaign.\n\nAnd even though voters approved Mr. Newsom's redistricting measure, it could prove for naught if Republicans manage to hold on to the House, dimming the relevance of the victory on Tuesday.\n\n\"While it's a very important win for him politically, this is just the first step,\" said Brian Brokaw, a Democratic strategist who advises Mr. Newsom. \"Doing what he can to make sure that Democrats win those seats and take back the majority in the midterms will be just as important. Without that, Proposition 50 will have been just a blip along the way.\"\n\nAnd Republicans have already made clear that no matter Mr. Newsom's victory with Proposition 50, they would try to diminish his standing in California and nationally, and seek to derail his attempt to stake out a spot on the presidential stage.\n\n\"Gavin Newsom wants to be president, but before chasing his next job, he's got 12 months left to try and clean up the mess he made in California,\" said Steve Hilton, a Republican and former Fox News host who's running for governor. \"Instead of running the state he's been trying to rig our elections.\"\n\nStill, it's hard to recall a time when Mr. Newsom appeared in such a commanding political position. He raised $114 million for the redistricting campaign, including $38 million from supporters responding to text and email appeals, assembling the kind of small donor list that could prove critical in a presidential race. Much of that money came from outside California.\n\nThe result came not only at a pivotal time for Mr. Newsom but for his party, which believes it has a chance to win back Congress from Republicans. The new lines are expected to help Democrats win as many as five House seats now held by Republicans in California.\n\nOn Tuesday night, Mr. Newsom spoke solemnly about a nation struggling through perilous times, in a speech that suggested the themes he will no doubt strike again in the coming months.\n\n\"I hope it's dawning on people, the sobriety of this moment -- what's at stake,\" he said.",

    "title": "Inside the bumbling, dysfunctional tin-cup campaign to block Newsom's gerrymander",
    "body": "\"Any attempt to undermine the nonpartisan California Redistricting Commission will be strongly opposed in the courts and at the ballot box,\" he wrote on a newly created X account.\n\nAt the time, Newsom's plan to tear up California's popular independent redistricting commission, gerrymander the state's congressional seats, and then ask voters to sign off on it seemed to be a hubristic plan bordering on delusional. Polls at the time suggested the measure would be enormously difficult to pass. Even many Democrats believed the plan was unrealistic.\n\nPerhaps most dauntingly, Newsom had braced for a formidable, bipartisan opposition campaign backed by national Republican money. But as Tuesday's result shows, the Republican effort to defeat Proposition 50, on life support for the past month, was never up to the fight.\n\nWhat began as an alliance of convenience would eventually dissolve into internal feuding, strategic confusion and an exasperated Republican National Committee member approaching top party officials with a \"tin cup.\" Why the alliance unraveled, and how, is the story of Proposition 50's passage.\n\n\"No way Newsom was going to get away with this\"\n\nIn mid-August, as Newsom tried to rush a new map onto the Nov. 4 ballot, an opposition campaign was gathering steam.\n\nFormer House Speaker Kevin McCarthy told his home-state congressional delegation that he would aim to raise up to $100 million to combat Newsom's gerrymander. Munger was hiring a team for the campaign committee called Protect Voters First as he commissioned polls and focus groups to understand voter attitudes.\n\nAdvisers for Arnold Schwarzenegger, the face of redistricting reforms during his time in office, were indicating that he was willing to campaign against the measure, part of what he called \"race to the bottom.\" The former governor, by at least one measure the country's most popular Republican, posted a picture to Instagram of himself pumping iron while wearing a shirt that read \"terminate gerrymandering.\"\n\nInfluential good-government groups, notably California Common Cause and the state's League of Women Voters chapter, both of which had partnered with Munger and Schwarzenegger 15 years earlier to pass redistricting reforms, signaled they would join the fight. In an early August email to Munger, California Common Cause's executive director laid out plans to combat gerrymandering in Texas and California, telling Munger he was \"excited\" to partner and pledging a \"full-scale campaign to defeat a gerrymandering ballot initiative.\"\n\nTaken together, there was the making of a coalition that could challenge Newsom's political machine. Munger and his team of good-government reformers would target politically unaffiliated voters and Democrats reluctant to tear up the independent redistricting commission. A separate committee, called Stop Sacramento's Power Grab, led by McCarthy and former California Republican Party chair Jessica Millan Patterson, would focus on mobilizing Republicans.\n\n\"You're going to see different messengers, but it's all going to be the same message,\" Millan Patterson said in August. \"That message is: California voters decided in 2010 that they didn't want Sacramento politicians choosing who were their constituents. They wanted the people to have the power to decide who the representatives are, and that's why we have the Citizens Redistricting Commission.\"\n\nThe combined finances of the two parallel committees, party officials believed, would be able to match Newsom's fundraising apparatus and at least fight the ad wars to a draw. Schwarzenegger would bring star power to match Newsom's bully pulpit.\n\n\"McCarthy comes out and it's looking really good ... he was going to have a formidable warchest,\" said Shawn Steel, a member of the RNC executive committee who has helped lead the state party's efforts throughout the Prop 50 campaign. \"There was no way that Newsom was going to get away with this.\"\n\nBut there were latent tensions between the various No factions and their strategic choices. Munger and Schwarzenegger, both pre-MAGA Republicans who had grown estranged from their party, were equally critical of Texas' redistricting ploy. The good-government groups were frequently at odds with Trump, but McCarthy, a close White House ally, was unlikely to do anything that broke with him.\n\nIn a state where Trump's approval rating hovered around 30 percent, a campaign that became a referendum on the president seemed almost certain to be a losing proposition. Early on, according to Steel, all of the parties involved came to the decision that they should work to keep Trump from playing any public role in the race.\n\nWhile Newsom tried to frame the question along partisan lines, Munger would take the lead promoting the merits of California's popular, voter-approved, independent redistricting commission. Hours after Newsom signed the legislation referring Proposition 50 to the ballot, Munger seeded Protect Voters First with its initial $10 million. He hoped the early cash infusion would buy time while the emerging campaigns pursued other money elsewhere.\n\nFor whom the kettlebell tolls\n\nMunger's personal fortune was enough to help opponents define their mission early. Within days, Munger's campaign landed its first communication in the mailboxes of persuadable voters, saying that Prop 50 was \"weakening our democratic process\" and prominently quoting the president of the League of Women Voters of California.\n\nProtect Voters First was counting on good-government groups to validate their arguments to centrist and left-leaning voters in California already leery of giving politicians more power. Common Cause, especially, had a long relationship with Munger, having granted him its National Civic Leadership Award in 2012 for his work on redistricting reforms.\n\nBut by 2025, circumstances had changed. On August 20, the day before Newsom placed Prop 50 on the ballot, California Common Cause announced that the measure met its \"fairness criteria,\" infuriating some of its own leadership. (The group refused a subsequent Munger request for a meeting, and then a $200,000 donation from him with the explanation Common Cause \"could not be bought.\")\n\nA week later, the League of Women Voters backed away from its own long relationship with Munger. The league's state chapter announced it would not take a position on Prop 50, deflecting that \"it is time for the voters to decide.\"\n\nSchwarzenegger, too, seemed newly ambivalent about the cause. After his initial Instagram post on Aug. 15, the presumed face of an opposition effort had gone silent about Prop 50. When Munger flew down to Los Angeles to meet with him, Schwarzenegger made it clear that he would not officially join any committee.\n\nWith few other major donors, Munger's outsized centrality to the No side's campaign soon became a liability. Seizing on his wealth and party affiliation, California Democrats began lambasting Munger in early September as an \"anti-choice mega millionaire\" and mocked him in advertisements as the Jack to Trump's King in a rigged card game.\n\nMunger's team couldn't quite agree on how to fight back. When Munger's staff urged him to tell the public that he was not in-fact anti-choice or homophobic, he resisted. Advisers wanted Munger to go further in opposition to the Texas gerrymander, in addition to California's. Some proposed hiring a demographer to help interpret new district maps so the campaign could make personalized appeals to voters about how the changes would affect their political representation.\n\nThe campaign's advertisements were placed in the hands of Ray McNally and Richard Temple, whose McNally Temple Associates had won Munger's loyalty on his past successful redistricting campaigns. Their first ad against Prop 50 -- and for weeks Protect Voters First's most widely aired message -- showing a kettlebell crushing wood blocks reading \"Fair Elections\" was widely panned for its schoolhouse feel.\n\n\"When I saw that ad, I was like...what the fuck is this,\" said a no-side consultant, granted anonymity to speak freely about tactics. \"But [Munger] is a very loyal man.\"\n\nDespite its robust budget, the Munger campaign conceded digital space to Newsom and other Democratic figures organizing support for the Yes side online. While Munger had kettlebells, Newsom was hosting a telethon-style event with social-media influencers and reinventing himself as a high-concept Trump impressionist. In September, Protect Voters First accounts had posted just a handful of times on X and Facebook, to only a few dozen followers on each platform.\n\nSchwarzenegger did, ultimately, wade into the debate -- but only on his terms. On Sept. 15, he made his most substantive comments in opposition to Newsom's redistricting campaign at a University of Southern California forum, calling Prop 50 \"insane\" and warning voters not to \"get closer to the cliff.\" Schwarzenegger's advisers allowed Munger's team to send a camera crew, the closest he would come to recording an advertisement for Protect Voters First. One featuring Schwarzenegger's comments quickly replaced the kettlebells.\n\nThe McCarthy-led campaign, for its part, was trying to mount an overtly partisan effort to engage Republicans. When asked on Sept. 3 what would have to go wrong for the No side to lose, Millan Patterson's response to the hypothetical was \"we didn't have the resources to turn out our voters.\"\n\nBut it was weeks after the committee was formed that they finally pulled in their first seven-figure contribution. By the end of September that effort had brought in just $7 million, almost all of it in a single transfer from the CLF, with another $1 million each from McCarthy's dormant congressional campaign committee and software entrepreneur Thomas Siebel. The imagined $100 million campaign was struggling to break double digits.\n\nStop Sacramento's Power Grab did not air its first television ad until the week of Sept. 22. Even then, the committee spent only about $500,000 on ad buys - one-tenth of the Newsom committee's weekly television budget. Polls now showed the race as closer to a toss-up.\n\nOne messaging plan was to attack the state's most prominent Democrats over their past resistance to independent redistricting commissions. In press releases and interviews, the campaign targeted Sen. Alex Padilla and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi for past donations to defeat the 2010 independent redistricting measure while singling out Newsom for vetoing legislation in 2023 that would have created local independent redistricting commissions.\n\n\"They have always wanted the power to lie with the politicians,\" Millan Patterson said at the time. \"We're absolutely going to be talking about their record on this.\"\n\nMillan Patterson's group believed such a strategy would boost Republican turnout. But the message won critics in the state party, including party chair Corrin Rankin, who questioned the wisdom of building their campaign around figures whom polls showed to be popular with Californians. (A Stop Sacramento's Power Grab spokesperson declined to comment for this article.)\n\n\"I don't think this is about Gavin Newsom,\" Rankin told reporters in September.",

Joe Manchin, D-W.Va, and Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., and added \"Well, now WE are in power, and if we did what we should be doing,\" Trump suggested that by getting rid of the filibuster, the Republicans could end the government shutdown.\n\nIn his victory speech on Tuesday night, New York Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani directly called out the president, saying: \"Donald Trump, since I know you're watching, I have four words for you: turn the volume up.\" He then added: \"New York will remain a city of immigrants, a city built by immigrants, powered by immigrants, and as of tonight led by an immigrant...So hear me, President Trump, when I say this: to get to any of us, you will have to get through all of us.\" After the result of the California redistricting ballot measure was called, Governor Gavin Newsom said, \"We're proud of the work the people of California did today to send a powerful message to a historic president.

    "title": "After Confirming Possible White House Run, California's Newsom Scores a Win in Fight for US House",
    "body": "LOS ANGELES (AP) -- California Gov. Gavin Newsom, eager to raise his national profile as a Democrat willing to aggressively confront President Donald Trump, scored a campaign victory Tuesday that may help his party in the midterms as he moves toward a White House run.\n\nWith Proposition 50, Newsom successfully bet he could persuade California voters to throw out independently drawn U.S. House maps in favor of new districts designed to help Democrats win five more seats.\n\nHis gamble was a response to Trump's redistricting push in Texas, where Republicans hope to pick up five seats of their own. Republicans have made similar moves in other states in an effort to maintain their grip on power for the remainder of Trump's term. Democrats have too, but they have fewer options. Newsom framed the campaign as a near-existential conflict, arguing that democracy was at risk.\n\nThe two-month campaign sprint cemented Newsom's status as one of Trump's leading adversaries at a time when even many Democrats described the party as ineffective and weak.\n\n\"We stood tall and we stood firm in response to Donald Trump's recklessness,\" Newsom said Tuesday. \"After poking the bear, this bear roared.\"\n\nDemocrats are eager for a fighter\n\nThe contest further raised Newsom's profile among activists who are clamoring for Democratic leaders willing to battle Trump, said Celinda Lake, a veteran Democratic pollster and strategist. Newsom can now point to a tangible victory, she said.\n\n\"Democrats think that finally someone's standing up and being creative and thinking outside the box and fighting back,\" Lake said. \"And that's a very strong profile.\"\n\nThe election win comes shortly after Newsom last month confirmed for the first time that he is considering running for president in 2028. He told CBS News he'll make a decision after next year's midterms.\n\n\"Yeah, I'd be lying otherwise,\" Newsom responded when asked if he'd give serious thought to a presidential campaign.\n\nThough the next presidential election is three years away, ambitious Democrats are jockeying for an advantage in a crowded primary field that's already taking shape.\n\n\"He's betting that Democratic primary voters will remember that he was standing as this bulwark against Trump as he's attempting to consolidate power,\" said Sawyer Hackett, a Democratic strategist and commentator. \"And I think that he's right about that.\"\n\nCalifornia is a 'blessing and a curse'\n\nNewsom is nearing his last year in office as California's governor. He can use that time to continue stoking his national profile by fighting back against Trump while working on a vision for the Democratic Party, said Hackett, who managed former cabinet secretary Julian Castro's 2020 presidential campaign.\n\nHe'll face a tangle of ongoing problems that affect not only the quality of life of California residents but the state's image in the rest of the country. They include an ongoing homelessness crisis, high energy bills, a struggling home insurance market, notoriously high taxes and housing costs that have been driving residents out of state in search of affordable living.\n\nVoters last year spurned fellow Californian Kamala Harris, then the sitting vice president.\n\n\"California is a political blessing and a curse,\" said Thad Kousser, a political scientist at University of California, San Diego. \"It rockets you to prominence and comes with the baggage of the state's political stereotypes.\"\n\nA majority of California voters \"strongly\" or \"somewhat\" approve of the way Newsom is handling his job as governor, but support for a Newsom presidential run is lower.\n\nJust over half of California voters said they would not like to see Newsom run for president in 2028, according to the AP Voter Poll, while 45% said they would. That includes some voters who support him generally or share his party: About 2 in 10 voters who approved of Newsom's performance running the state don't want him to seek the Oval Office, and about 3 in 10 Democrats or voters who lean toward the Democratic Party don't want him to run.\n\nThey're even less excited about Harris running again -- about 7 in 10 California voters said they're opposed to her running in 2028.\n\nKalinda Jones, who teaches social work classes at a community college outside Sacramento, said Newsom could be a possible choice for president, but she wasn't enthusiastic about him or any other candidate. Jones supported Proposition 50.\n\n\"I guess right now, he seems like a good option,\" Jones said.\n\nRepublican Dennis Guerrero, a 67-year-old retired salesperson who voted against Proposition 50, said he faults Newsom for his inability to slow the homeless crisis, among other issues.\n\n\"I would not vote for him for president,\" Guerrero said.\n\nNewsom seeks a place on the national stage\n\nThe Proposition 50 fight gave Newsom something else that will be valuable if he decides to run for president -- donors big and small.\n\nNewsom and his allies spent roughly $100 million. His campaign team says he collected 1.2 million contributions and brought in so much money that they asked people to stop giving. Campaign finance records show well over 100,000 donations came from outside California.\n\nNewsom has long sought a more prominent voice on the national stage. As far back as 2022, Newsom was blaming his own party for setbacks in the nation's culture wars, asking at the time, \"Where is the Democratic Party?\"\n\nHe has traveled extensively in recent years, including to crucial early-voting states like South Carolina, and is appearing on television shows and podcasts with national audiences, making some obvious steps toward the political center. He stunned fellow Democrats by holding mostly chummy conversations with prominent conservatives on a new podcast he touted as a way for the party to grapple with the \"Make America Great Again\" movement's popularity and reach out to young men who have soured on the Democratic Party.\n\nMeanwhile, his press office has delighted Democrats and attracted widespread attention by mimicking Trump's bombastic, all-caps social media posts.\n\n\"Newsom is the one Democrat of this generation who has leaned into the culture wars and done quite well with that,\" noted Republican consultant Mike Madrid, a longtime Trump critic. Denting Trump's momentum is \"what the Democratic base has been looking for. They want a fight.\"",

    "title": "Seven election takeaways - from Trump the foil to post-cancellation politics",
    "body": "Heading into the midterms, Democrats showed signs of rebuilding and shoring up their battled coalition following last year's sweeping setbacks -- almost every single county in New Jersey and Virginia trended leftward compared to the 2024 margins.\n\nHere are seven takeaways from Tuesday's elections:\n\nTrump remains off-year gold for Democrats\n\nIn the blue states of California, New Jersey and Virginia, Newsom, Sherrill and Spanberger effectively used Trump as a foil for their electoral efforts.\n\nTrump wasn't on the ballot Tuesday -- a fact he quickly trotted out on Truth Social to rationalize the wake of setbacks for his party.\n\nOne would be forgiven for thinking he was.\n\nYes, he did not campaign fulsomely for Republicans, distancing himself from off-year elections historically unkind to the party in the White House -- let alone one controlling all major levers of power amid a historic government shutdown. But voters used the few races to send him a message, according to exit polls, which showed that more than half saw their vote as anti-Trump, according to CNN.\n\nTrump found himself under water in New Jersey, where 55 percent disapproved of him, and in Virginia, where 56 percent gave him a thumbs down, according to NBC. In the blue bastions of New York City, amid its mayoral race, and California, amid its Proposition 50 campaign to redistrict its congressional maps, his disapproval rose to 69 percent and 63 percent.\n\nSherrill and Spanberger used Trump to motivate Democrats at every turn -- with Sherrill's Republican opponent Ciattarelli adopting the line, \"If you get a flat tire on the way home tonight, she's going to blame it on President Trump.\"\n\nIt worked.\n\nBlack and brown voters swing back\n\nDemocrats went into this election fretting about Trump's gains among Black and Hispanic voters. The returns made clear they're reversing that trend ahead of the midterms.\n\nDespite Ciattarelli's attempts to match Trump's inroads, Sherrill's dominant performance extended to areas with large Black and Hispanic communities.\n\nIn one of the key battleground counties, Passaic -- a typically Democratic area with a plurality of Hispanic residents that Trump flipped last year -- Sherrill led by 15 points, according to preliminary results. She also mounted a commanding lead in Essex County -- home to the state's most populous city of Newark -- which has a plurality of Black voters.\n\nExit polling also showed Sherrill with large margins among Black, Hispanic and Asian voters -- demographics national Democrats spent millions of dollars to reengage during the campaign.\n\nSherrill's campaign focused on economic messaging -- blaming Trump for not delivering on his 2024 affordability promises that appealed to voters in Democrats' coalition. Whether voters were rejecting Trump or just not interested in Ciattarelli, it worked out for Democrats.\n\nNewsom's big redistricting risk pays off\n\nIn the beginning, it looked like a gamble. But Gavin Newsom's Proposition 50 to counter Texas' midcycle redistricting by netting Democrats as many as five congressional seats next year appears to have fully vaulted him into Democrats' most dominant electoral figure heading into the midterms.\n\nIn the end, the result was not even close: Initial returns Tuesday night show nearly 65 percent of voters favoring the Newsom-backed measure. The result reflected the campaign: Republicans, divided in strategy over how to oppose the measure, lagged in fundraising and campaigning; Newsom led the charge with money and messaging from national Democrats.\n\n\"We stood tall and we stood firm in response to Donald Trump's recklessness,\" Newsom said in his victory speech. \"And tonight, after poking the bear, this bear roared with an unprecedented turnout in a special election with an extraordinary result.\"\n\nAt a moment when Democrats prize fighters, Newsom has positioned himself as the ultimate prizefighter.\n\nDemocrats storm back in the suburbs\n\nIn Trump 1.0, Spanberger rode 2018's so-called blue wave into Congress as it crashed through suburbs. On Tuesday, she did it again, and by some measures the wave might just be bigger: In several D.C.-area counties, Spanberger's margins even surpassed former Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam's 2017 performance.\n\nTake Loudoun County, a wealthy enclave in northern Virginia: Northam won it by 20 points -- a number no Democrat has beaten since. Spanberger won it by 29 points, according to preliminary results. Nearby Prince William County, which Northam won by 23 points, went for Spanberger by nearly 34 points.\n\nSpanberger's strong performance in northern Virginia may have been fueled by the large population of federal workers, for whom Trump's second term has been particularly disruptive due to layoffs under the Department of Government Efficiency, and the more recent government shutdown that has left many federal workers without a paycheck. In exit polls, nearly three in five voters said federal cuts this year affected their finances; 68 percent of them went for Spanberger.\n\nBut her strong suburban performance was not limited to northern Virginia. She also put up sizeable numbers in the suburbs around Richmond. Henrico County, just outside the capital, went for Northam by 23 points in 2017, and for Spanberger by 38 points.\n\nJay Jones wins in a new post-cancellation era of politics\n\nDemocrat Jay Jones pulled off a stunning comeback, overcoming his party's fears that his scandal of sending violent text messages about political rivals would drag the rest of the ticket and doom his chances of becoming Virginia's first Black attorney general.\n\nWith his victory, Jones achieved a feat neither Abigail Spanberger nor Ghazala Hashmi, Virginia's gubernatorial and lieutenant governor, could. He toppled the only incumbent in the race in Jason Miyares, who was the lone statewide nominee to receive Trump's full endorsement, helping Democrats send a resounding message that Virginia, as it has in all three of his White House runs, rejects Trump.\n\nRiding a wave of anti-Trump sentiment and Spanberger's commanding lead in the polls, Democrats proved party loyalty and a desire for an attorney general who would sue the Trump administration for what he characterized as \"illegal\" firings of federal employees. Republicans tried to insist during the closing stretch the race had \"become [a] referendum on decency,\" but voters disagreed.\n\nIn what looks like the dawn of the post-cancellation era among Democrats, Jones' win will likely be seen as a blueprint for Maine Senate candidate Graham Platner, who has come under fire for his since-deleted online post advocating for violence as a necessary means to achieving social change. Democrats are hoping this proves they can overlook past indiscretions.\n\nMamdani is the GOP's new face of the Democratic party\n\nJudging by their gleeful reaction, Republicans found their only bright spot in Zohran Mamdani's New York City mayoral victory -- one they believe will allow them to tie the national party to him at the hip.\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson, for instance, said Mamdani's \"election cements the Democrat Party's transformation to a radical, big-government socialist party.\" The National Republican Congressional Committee sent press releases Tuesday night accusing House Democrats in swing districts of \"taking orders\" from Mamdani. And Rep. Elise Stefanik, running for governor in New York, was quick to jump on Gov. Kathy Hochul's endorsement of Mamdani, calling her \"owned lock, stock, and barrel by the radical Far Left Socialist takeover.\"\n\nMamdani's quoting of Eugene Debs, the avowed socialist who sought the presidency from a prison cell, in the opening seconds of his victory speech only made Republicans' case against him easier to prosecute.\n\nDemocrats find a midterm message\n\nDemocrats emerged from Tuesday's elections with a split decision in their progressives versus. moderate proxy battle, with lefty Mamdani winning New York City's mayoral contest and moderate Spanberger delivering a double-digit margin of victory in Virginia.\n\nDespite their differences, both emphasized cost of living, as did Sherrill. And voters approved: In New Jersey, 58 percent of respondents in exit polls identified electricity costs as a \"major problem.\" In New York City, 70 percent of voters pointed to housing costs. In his victory speech, Mamdani touted the \"most ambitious agenda to tackle the cost of living crisis\" since the days of former Mayor Fiorello La Guardia.\n\n\"Democrats are a huge tent but all over the country they showed two things: it's not enough to just run against Trump, you need a positive, affirmative vision and you also need to meet the voters where they are on the issues that matter to them,\" said the Democratic strategist Eric Koch. \"It takes many poles to hold up our big tent but tonight we showed how we can do it.\"\n\nFor as much as 2025 has dealt Democrats a series of intra-party proxy battles between progressives and centrists, on Tuesday night they coalesced around a message -- affordability -- that could bridge the divide ahead of the midterms.",

    "title": "California voters approve new U.S. House map to boost Democrats in 2026",
    "body": "California Governor Gavin Newsom announces that California is suing the White House to restore SNAP funding before the cutoff during a news conference in Sacramento, California, U.S., Oct. 28, 2025.\n\nCalifornia voters approved new congressional district boundaries Tuesday, delivering a victory for Democrats in the state-by-state redistricting battle that will help determine which party wins control of the U.S. House in 2026 and, with it, the power to thwart or advance President Donald Trump's agenda.\n\nThe approval of Proposition 50 gives Democrats a shot at winning as many as five additional seats, just enough to blunt Texas Republicans' move to redraw their own maps to pick up five GOP seats at Trump's urging. Texas' move and California's response have kicked off a flurry of redistricting efforts around the country, with Republican states appearing to have an edge. Deeply blue California is Democrats' best opportunity to make up seats.\n\nMidterm elections typically punish the party in the White House, and Trump is fighting to maintain his party's slim House majority. Republicans hold 219 seats to Democrats' 213.\n\nTuesday's results mark a political victory for Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, who cast the measure as an essential tool to fight back against Trump and protect American democracy.\n\nMeasure supported by Newsom, Obama\n\nCalifornia's Proposition 50 asked voters to suspend House maps drawn by an independent commission and replace them with rejiggered districts adopted by the Democratic-controlled Legislature. Those new districts would be in place for the 2026, 2028 and 2030 elections.\n\nThe recast districts aim to dilute Republican voters' power, in one case by uniting rural, conservative-leaning parts of far northern California with Marin County, a famously liberal coastal stronghold across the Golden Gate Bridge from San Francisco.\n\nThe measure was spearheaded by Newsom, who threw the weight of his political operation behind it in a major test of his mettle ahead of a potential 2028 presidential campaign. Former President Barack Obama urged voters to pass it as well.\n\nNewsom sought to nationalize the campaign, depicting the proposal as a counterweight to all things Trump.\n\n\"Republicans want to steal enough seats in Congress to rig the next election and wield unchecked power for two more years,\" Obama says in one ad. \"You can stop Republicans in their tracks.\"\n\nCritics said two wrongs don't make a right. They urged Californians to reject what they call a Democratic power grab, even if they have misgivings about Trump's moves in Republican-led states.\n\nAmong the most prominent critics was Arnold Schwarzenegger, the movie star and former Republican governor who pushed for the creation of the independent commission, which voters approved in 2008 and 2010. It makes no sense to fight Trump by becoming him, Schwarzenegger said in September, arguing that the proposal would \"take the power away from the people.\"\n\n\"I don't want Newsom to have control,\" said Rebecca Fleshman, a 63-year-old retired medical assistant from Norco in Southern California, who voted against the measure. \"I don't want the state to be blue. I want it to be red.\"\n\nA lopsided campaign foreshadowed the vote\n\nAfter an early burst of TV advertising, opponents of the plan struggled to raise cash in a state with some of the nation's most expensive media markets. Data compiled by advertising tracker AdImpact last week showed Democrats and other supporters with over $5 million in ad buys booked on broadcast TV, cable and radio. But opponents had virtually no time reserved, though the data didn't include some popular streaming services like Hulu and YouTube or mail advertising.\n\nThe campaign followed an unusual trajectory. A handful of Republican congressmen who will see their districts dramatically reshaped - and their jobs endangered -- mostly stayed away from the campaign spotlight. With opponents short on cash, Newsom and his supporters dominated TV screens in the critical closing weeks.\n\nTotal spending on broadcast and cable ads topped $100 million, with more than two-thirds of it coming from supporters. Newsom told people to stop donating in the race's final weeks.\n\nThe GOP congressmen -- Reps. Ken Calvert, Darrell Issa, Kevin Kiley, David Valadao and Doug LaMalfa -- will see right-leaning voters reduced and left-leaning voters boosted in their respective districts in a shift that would make it likely a Democratic candidate would prevail in each race.\n\nIssa issued a defiant statement, saying: \"I'm not going anywhere. I'll continue to represent the people of California regardless of their party or where they live. I'm not quitting on California.\"\n\nCalvert said Newsom engineered a \"power grab\" while housing costs, gas prices and taxes continue to strain family budgets. \"I am determined to keep fighting for the families I represent,\" he said in an email.\n\nAP poll finds voters motivated by political reasons\n\nProposition 50 won a swift and decisive victory, as the AP declared a winner when polls closed statewide. Early returns were strongly in favor of the measure, as were preliminary results from the AP Voter Poll, an expansive survey of more than 4,000 voters in California.\n\nRoughly 7 in 10 California voters said party control of Congress was \"very important\" to them, and those voters overwhelmingly supported the measure, according to the AP Voter Poll.\n\nAbout 8 in 10 California voters who supported the ballot measure said it was necessary to counter the changes made by Republicans in other states, while only about 2 in 10 said they supported it because it was the best way to draw maps, AP Voter Poll found.\n\nTrump, who overwhelmingly lost California in his three presidential campaigns, largely stayed out of the fray. A week before the election, he urged voters in a social media post not to vote early or by mail -- messaging that conflicted with that of top Republicans in the state who urged people to get their ballots in as soon as possible.\n\nIn a post Tuesday on his social media platform, the president called the state's voting process \"RIGGED\" and warned that it was \"under very serious legal and criminal review. STAY TUNED!\" Secretary of State Shirley Weber called that \"another baseless claim.\"\n\nThe national House map is in flux\n\nDemocrats hope to pick up as many as five seats in California if voters approve the new boundaries, offsetting the five that Republicans are looking to pick up through their new Texas maps. Republicans also expect to gain one seat each from new maps in Missouri and North Carolina, and potentially two more in Ohio.\n\nCongressional district boundaries are typically redrawn every 10 years to reflect population shifts documented in the census. Mid-decade redistricting is unusual, absent a court order finding fault with the maps in place.\n\nFive other GOP-led states are also considering new maps: Florida, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana and Nebraska.\n\nOn the Democratic side, Colorado, Illinois, Maryland, New York and Virginia have proposals to redraw maps, but major hurdles remain.\n\nA court has ordered new boundaries be drawn in Utah, where all four House districts are represented by Republicans, but it remains to be seen if the state will approve a map that makes any of them winnable for Democrats.\n\nSiddhartha Deb, 52, has lived in the U.S. since he was 7 years old but he just became a citizen Tuesday. Immediately afterward he registered to vote at San Francisco City Hall and cast his ballot in favor of Newsom's measure.\n\n\"I don't like the way the Republican Party is basically trying to rig elections by gerrymandering,\" Deb said. \"And this is the only way, to fight fire with fire.\"",

    "body": "WASHINGTON (AP) -- California voters on Tuesday approved a ballot measure that would implement a new congressional map drawn to elect more Democrats to the U.S. House.\n\nThe new map, drawn and passed by the Democratic-controlled state Legislature and pushed by Gov. Gavin Newsom, could help flip five seats from Republican to Democratic in next year's midterm elections. The map would be in place for the next three election cycles.\n\nThe measure was introduced in response to Texas' midcycle redistricting, which also aims to flip five seats to elect more Republicans. The ballot measure, known as Proposition 50, directs California's independent redistricting commission to resume enacting congressional maps in 2031. The Associated Press declared the measure passed at 11 p.m. EST.",

    "body": "Cecilio Padilla is a digital producer for CBS Sacramento and a Sacramento-area native who has been covering Northern California for more than a decade.\n\nCalifornia voters have passed Proposition 50, CBS News projects, approving a measure backed by Gov. Gavin Newsom and legislative Democrats that will redraw the state's congressional districts.\n\nThe measure is intended to make several Republican-held congressional districts in California more favorable to Democrats in the 2026 midterm elections in an effort to counter recent redistricting in states including Texas that favors Republicans.\n\nProposition 50's passage drew swift reaction from high-profile opponents of the measure, including Republican political donor Charles Munger, Jr.\n\n\"For what looms for the people of California, I am saddened by the passage of Proposition 50,\" Munger said. \"But I am content in this, at least: that our campaign educated the people of California so they could make an informed, if in my view unwise, decision about such a technical but critical issue as redistricting reform, a decision forced to be made over such a very short time.\"\n\nProposition 50 was approved by the Legislature and signed by Newsom on Aug. 21, allowing it to go before voters for a Nov. 4 special election.\n\nHere's what to know about Proposition 50 and California's special election.\n\nIt could take several days to count all mail-in ballots, as California accepts ballots postmarked by Election Day and received within seven days.\n\nProposition 50 will replace California's current congressional district maps that were drawn by the independent California Citizens Redistricting Commission after the 2020 U.S. Census. New maps, crafted by the state Legislature, redraw the state's congressional districts to make five Republican-held U.S. House seats in California more favorable for Democrats in the 2026 midterm elections.\n\nCalifornia Democrats have called Proposition 50 a countermeasure to Texas' recent redistricting push that was backed by President Trump and created five Republican-friendly congressional seats in that state.\n\nCalifornia voters approved the creation of the independent redistricting commission earlier this century to oversee the congressional mapmaking process. The commission uses census data and public input to set district boundaries that reflect population changes and keep communities together.\n\nIf voters had rejected Proposition 50, California would have continued using its current congressional district boundaries until new maps are drawn by the redistricting commission after the 2030 Census.\n\nGov. Newsom and top Democratic leaders, including many who are trying to succeed him in California's 2026 gubernatorial race, have championed Proposition 50.\n\nOther major supporters of Proposition 50 include billionaire investors George Soros and Tom Steyer, and former President Barack Obama, who featured in a Yes on 50 campaign ad, calling on voters to approve the ballot measure.\n\nSupporters argue that Proposition 50 defends democracy and restores fairness after redistricting efforts in GOP-led states like Texas.\n\nFormer Republican California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger has criticized the redistricting effort, saying the initiative \"doesn't make sense.\" Schwarzenegger has also appeared in ads that oppose Proposition 50.\n\nOthers who oppose the initiative include Republican political donor Charles Munger, Jr., who contributed more than $32.7 million, and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy.\n\nOpponents argue that Proposition 50 is gerrymandering and that California should maintain its standard for fair redistricting through independent, citizen-led redistricting.\n\nProposition 50 was placed on the ballot by the California Legislature earlier this year.\n\nLawmakers approved the measure during a special session in August, and Newsom's signature set the stage for this statewide special election.\n\nAmong California's 52 congressional districts, Democrats represent 43 while Republicans represent nine.\n\nProposition 50 was created to redraw congressional districts to make five of them currently held by GOP House members more favorable to being won by Democrats in next year's midterms. Still, there is no guarantee that Democrats will win the seats even though voters have approved the new maps.\n\nThe five Republican-led congressional districts most targeted under Proposition 50 are Rep. Doug LaMalfa's District 1, Rep. Kevin Kiley's District 3, Rep. David Valadao's District 22, Rep. Ken Calvert's District 41, and Rep. Darrell Issa's District 48.",

    "title": "Prop. 50 win gives Newsom's presidential prospects a huge boost",
    "body": "Ever since the Sept. 30 deadline for filing quarterly campaign fundraising reports, it's been obvious that Gov. Gavin Newsom's pet ballot measure, Proposition 50, was going to win by a landslide.\n\nNow it's become clear that the big margin by which the anti-Donald Trump redistricting plan passed will give Newsom a big leg up on the 2028 presidential campaign he has finally admitted he's considering.\n\nThe win became obvious when the finance reports showed Democrats had donated more than twice as much to pass Prop. 50 as Republicans had donated against it.\n\nThat was a sure-fire sign the Republicans had pretty much given up on defeating the proposition. It also meant an end to ex-Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger's persuasive anti-50 TV ads and caused Republicans to concentrate their efforts on other states where they hope to redistrict to create enough newly Republican districts to guarantee continued GOP control of the House of Representatives.\n\nThis worked for them in Missouri and North Carolina, gaining one GOP-oriented seat in each, but has failed so far in Kansas and Indiana. And there are the five former Democratic-oriented seats in Texas whose gerrymandering into GOP majorities started this whole thing.\n\nWithout House control, Trump would lack the freedom of movement he's enjoyed so far in his second term as president, a freedom he has sometimes believed might even give him the ability to run for a third term, despite the Constitutional ban on running more than twice.\n\nThat was why Trump began his effort by pressuring Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and its Legislature to redraw those five congressional seats.\n\nNewsom became the first national Democrat to fight back strongly, calling the Trump effort \"election rigging\" and getting those words into the title of his measure. The changes it makes, canceling districts drawn by California's non-partisan citizens redistricting commission and substituting a plan that figures to give Democrats five new seats to match those the party will likely lose in Texas, are temporary. In 2031, when new districts will be drawn anyhow, the job will revert to the citizens' commission.\n\nThat contradicts Schwarzenegger's often-repeated claim that Prop. 50 means the end for that commission, whose membership is reconstituted every 10 years.\n\nFor Newsom, it's the first time he's taken an action that directly hits back at a Trump effort, which can only bolster his standing among Democrats nationally. Polls show they're disappointed at their party's passivity in the face of Trump actions like sending troops into Democratic-run cities, trying to force colleges to buy into his education philosophy no matter how their students, faculty and state legislature might feel and his defiance of some court orders.\n\nWhile the results on 50 came as no surprise to anyone who read the Sept. 30 financial reports, the early count also suggested final totals might closely match a late October CBS News poll that showed 62 percent of likely special election voters would vote for the redistricting.\n\nThis was apparently enough to push Newsom into admitting at long last that he is \"considering\" a 2028 presidential run. He's betting Trump will not try to forestall that election by declaring a national emergency of some kind, and that whatever Republican is nominated will therefore be someone else.\n\nThat would run somewhat counter to longtime Trump advisor and former chief strategist Steve Bannon, now back in favor after serving jail time for three convictions of criminal contempt of Congress and fraud. He predicted the other day that Trump \"will be president in 2028.\" No one actually questions that; a new president is not due to be sworn in until early 2029. But did Bannon really mean 2029?\n\nNewsom plainly wants to become the next president in 2029, in part to undo a lot of what Trump has done. Things like his prophetic prediction of artillery products falling on the I-5 freeway in Camp Pendleton during a celebration of the Marine Corps' 250 anniversary despite Corps denials that it could happen, can only help him. His closure of that highway, where shrapnel actually fell on police vehicles, probably saved both lives and plenty of property damage.\n\nHis triumph with Prop. 50, coming soon afterward, will amplify the ground he gained on I-5.\n\nFor sure, his recent performances give him a leg up on other potential Democratic candidates like Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshears and former Vice President Kamala Harris.",

Gavin Newsom championed Prop. 50 at length heading into Election Day, repeatedly noting it was the best way to combat President Trump's power grab in Texas, where similar gerrymandering tactics have been executed.\n\n\"California and Californians have been uniquely targeted by the Trump Administration, and we are not going to sit idle while they command Texas and other states to rig the next election to keep power -- pursuing more extreme and unpopular policies,\" the governor noted back in August. \"This proposal would give Californians a choice to fight back -- and bring much needed accountability and oversight to the Trump Administration.\"\n\nNewsom and other California leaders have touted Prop. 50 as a \"direct response\" to Texas redrawing Congressional district lines, giving them five more seats in the U.S. House of Representatives. Per the CADem site, \"Proposition 50 proposes new lines for many of California's 52 congressional districts, which would negate the five Republican seats drawn by Texas.\"\n\nAnd so, Prop. 50 cancels out Texas' newly acquired seats, helping Democrats tackle the Trump administration's MAGA agenda head on.\n\nIn addition to Newsom, former President Barack Obama, Sen. Alex Padilla, Sen. Adam Schiff, Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez all endorsed the proposition before Election Day.\n\nYet -- in addition to President Trump and Vice President JD Vance -- former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger voiced his disapproval of Prop. 50, calling it \"a big scam.\"\n\nDuring an appearance on \"Real Time With Bill Maher\" last month, Schwarzenegger accused Prop. 50 of ripping \"away the power that the people in California have\" and giving \"it back to the politicians.\"\n\n\"We fought that for too long. Let's not do that,\" he said at the time. \"Let's be a good example. Let the Democrats outperform the Republicans, and therefore, because of their performance, win and get the House back.\"",

    "title": "How Newsom and allies delivered a redistricting counterpunch against Trump",
    "body": "Democratic officials in Washington and Texas wanted Gavin Newsom's help.\n\nThey reached out to the California governor's team in early July to ask if he could use his growing social media megaphone to push back on President Donald Trump and Texas Republicans, who were barreling toward redrawing the congressional map to their advantage. Newsom was happy to oblige.\n\nCalifornia \"could gerrymander like no other state,\" Newsom said July 9 as he sipped beers with a liberal interviewer on a swing through the South. In a clip of the interview he posted on TikTok, Newsom said he was rethinking the merits of his state's nonpartisan redistricting policy. The next week, after Trump briefed Texas congressional Republicans on redistricting during a July 15 call, Newsom escalated his threat on social media: \"Two can play this game.\"\n\nBut behind the scenes, Newsom and his Democratic allies had been less self-assured. They had begun exploring their own potential redistricting push, but unlike Texas, California had an independent redistricting commission they would have to get around. In June and July meetings in Sacramento, advisers told the governor he would likely need voters' approval for any change to the maps and would need to raise $100 million. The Democrats' chief mapmaker wasn't sure if drawing new lines could yield as many as five new Democratic seats to offset GOP gains in Texas -- or whether Democratic members of Congress would sign off.\n\n\"We didn't know that it was actually achievable,\" said Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-California), the chair of the California Democratic Congressional Delegation. But \"we didn't have the luxury to do anything else but focus.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, their efforts, and the risks they assumed, paid off as California voters approved Newsom's new map, Proposition 50, in a special election, the Associated Press projected. The Democratic victory marks a concrete response to Trump's political agenda less than a year into his second term. It gives Newsom, who many Democrats expect to run for president in 2028, a signature achievement to campaign on and a massive small-dollar fundraising list to tap. And it offers a party looking for ways to fight Trump's agenda a blue state road map for challenging him.\n\nThe nationwide redistricting battle is ongoing, with Trump-led efforts in other red states giving Republicans confidence about seizing an advantage when the dust settles. Some Democratic-led states are also trying to draw new maps, leaving the final outcome up in the air. The battle for the U.S. House majority is expected to be the marquee competition next year, with both sides looking for any advantage.\n\nCritics decried the governor's plan as a \"Newsom-mander\" and a \"power grab\" from political leaders who walked away from their onetime support of redistricting. Republicans were still drawing attention to the political risks for Newsom in the final hours before polls closed, with Rep. Doug LaMalfa (California) urging voters in video posted by the state Republican Party they should try to \"stop Newsom and his aspirations\" at the ballot box.\n\nThis story is based on more than two dozen interviews with members of Congress, congressional and political aides and Newsom advisers and confidants, many of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private conversations. Newsom declined to be interviewed.\n\n\"Ultimately it was the governor's call,\" said Jim DeBoo, a top Newsom strategist who managed the \"Yes on 50\" ballot campaign. \"It had to be a unified decision. In a situation like that, there can't be a lot of dissension. People have to jump off the proverbial cliff together.\"\n\nTexts, Zooms and a Trump-centric strategy\n\nIn the late spring, word was spreading around the Texas Capitol and in Democratic circles that Republicans were planning to redraw their congressional map. Texas Democrats reached out to Lofgren and House Democratic Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar (California) asking if their state was capable of a counter to the president's unprecedented mid-decade redistricting push.\n\nThey both called their redistricting expert, Paul Mitchell, who told them the idea was a nonstarter. Past legal precedent, he said, would make it futile to pursue any kind of mid-decade map drawing in the legislature and there was no reason to think voters would give up their popular nonpartisan commission.\n\nBut the conversation changed in July as the governor and California members began to feel a greater sense of urgency to counter the Trump-led efforts. Newsom's team began private research and polling to assess whether California voters would be willing to give up their independent process. They found that at least a narrow majority of Californians would back a ballot initiative changing the system if it was framed as a check on Trump's power -- a number that had potential to grow.\n\nIn late July and August, as they were still hashing out strategy behind the scenes, Newsom began promoting the argument. His team had built strong relationships with Democratic creators and social media influencers during the January fires and Trump's troop deployments in Los Angeles. Now, they were working closely with them to spread Newsom's message about Trump's moves in Texas to their millions of followers and viewers.\n\nThe strategy also enabled Newsom to nationalize the appeal at a time when Democratic activists and donors were desperate for a concrete way to fight Trump, ultimately helping him raise more than $38 million through 1.2 million donations from donors in all 50 states.\n\nIn private, Newsom involved himself in calls, texts and Zoom meetings with key California congressional Democrats -- Lofgren, former House speaker Nancy Pelosi and Aguilar, as well as the leaders of the California Senate and Assembly -- in late July and early August to shape strategy.\n\nHe sought advice from former president Barack Obama and Obama's attorney general, Eric Holder, who had both championed nonpartisan redistricting. He also consulted with House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (New York).\n\nJeffries and Newsom spoke by phone in mid-July, with the Democratic leader calling to thank Newsom for stating publicly that California was keeping all options on the table, an exchange that began what Jeffries described as \"an ongoing conversation.\" Around that same time, Jeffries made a public entrance to a private meeting of the California delegation -- conferring with Pelosi in full view of reporters.\n\n\"We understood that the first step was to try to get unanimity with the entire California congressional delegation, which is the largest in the country, and that's not an easy thing to achieve,\" Jeffries said. \"There's nothing more personal than people's districts.\"\n\nAt the delegation's meeting and on subsequent Zoom calls, members pressed Pelosi, the Democrats' most prodigious fundraiser, about whether they could raise more than $100 million that might be needed to win a California ballot campaign, which has no limits on contributions.\n\n\"We can raise the money, because we have to,\" Pelosi told them, according to several members.\n\nMap-drawing over 'chicken nuggets and Diet Coke'\n\nNewsom and his advisers worried that trying to engage voters on a subject as arcane as redistricting was a potential loser, particularly because California voters have tended to vote \"no\" if they are confused about a ballot measure. The governor also was not comfortable with abandoning the idea of California's nonpartisan redistricting commission, which he and many of the Democratic members of Congress had long supported. He and his advisers decided to present the measure as a temporary suspension of the independent redistricting commission's maps for three election cycles, hoping to mute critics.\n\nAt a meeting in late July, Democratic members of California's congressional delegation tapped Lofgren and Aguilar to pursue what was possible with the maps and whether they could forge consensus.\n\nMitchell, their chief redistricting expert, abandoned his plans for a vacation in Italy. He drove his wife and daughter to the airport, \"and I came home and got on a Zoom and didn't get off Zooms until two and a half weeks later,\" he said.\n\nThe tedious line drawing process unfolded over that period, including a day when Mitchell did 18 Zoom calls. While on the video calls with individual members -- and often Lofgren and Aguilar -- Mitchell looked at multiple monitors in front of him including a screen where he could see his staff redrawing the lines in real time as he discussed the changes with the members.\n\nEach change to one district created a domino effect of changes to others, requiring additional consultations with the members. Mitchell tapped a staff member in London to continue the mapping work at night while he and his colleagues slept.\n\nLofgren recalled joining video calls from 8 a.m. to midnight one day. Juggling other congressional and district business, Aguilar had his wife drive him around so he could be in the passenger seat on a laptop and he called into one Zoom at 1 a.m. from a delegation trip to Israel. Mitchell, who normally rides his bike 150 miles a week, barely made it outside and said he survived on \"chicken nuggets and Diet Coke.\" To prevent leaks, Mitchell only showed members and their staffs their portion of the map -- to prevent the overall map from becoming public before it was done.\n\nBy early August, the elements of what Pelosi described as a \"three-pillared approach\" were coming together. Democratic members of Congress had signed off on the new maps. California Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas and Senate Democratic leader Mike McGuire and other bill authors were drafting the legislation that they would introduce to set the ballot measure as soon as lawmakers returned to Sacramento on Aug. 18. On Aug. 21, both chambers passed the new map and accompanying legislation. Newsom quickly signed it into law, setting the election for Nov. 4.\n\nAn off-year campaign sprint\n\nAs soon as the legislation was signed, Pelosi, Newsom, Jeffries and other members began to push big donors, labor groups and Democratic organizations to start cutting checks -- sometimes for as much as $5 million. After forming the main campaign committee backing the ballot initiative, Newsom seeded the group with an initial $2.6 million from his own campaign accounts and he urged other donors to do at least as much.\n\nMany donors had been slow to give to Democratic causes, feeling burned by their party's steep losses in the 2024 campaign and others were skittish about giving at a moment when Trump has been so punitive toward his adversaries. But Pelosi, Newsom and Jeffries all argued in their fundraising calls that contributing to the ballot measure campaign wasn't just a one-time contribution. It would lay the foundation for Democrats to retake the majority in 2026, they argued.\n\n\"One of the things I said to all of them, was -- I don't want a win. I want a big win,\" Pelosi said.\n\nThe Trump administration, perhaps inadvertently, helped bring national attention to the Aug. 14 launch of Newsom's ballot measure campaign at the Democracy Center at the Japanese American National Museum in downtown Los Angeles when dozens of Border Patrol officers showed up outside the event. Clips of armed agents milling around outside the governor's event went viral, creating greater awareness about his Prop 50 campaign and juicing his fundraising effort.\n\nAt the outset, it appeared Newsom's ballot campaign was going to face a well-funded opposition. Stanford physicist Charles Munger Jr., a Berkshire Hathaway heir who had bankrolled the earlier ballot measures creating California's independent redistricting process, immediately announced that he would fight Newsom's effort. He wrote three $10 million checks in rapid sequence -- allowing his team to push out mail and immediately get up on the air with ads charging that Newsom's ballot measure would give power to the politicians.\n\nFormer House speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-California) and former California Republican Party chair Jessica Millan Patterson launched their own committee opposing Newsom's measure that was more explicitly aligned with Trump.\n\nBut the big spending some Republicans hoped to see never arrived. One hurdle they faced was skepticism among Republican donors that they could be successful in a state as blue as California at a moment of peak Democratic anger about Trump and his policies, according to two people familiar with the fundraising effort.\n\nTrump kept his distance from the contest, even as his political team worked closely with the Congressional Leadership Fund, the outside group aligned with House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-Louisiana), to help raise $25 million that was directed both to the McCarthy-aligned committee as well as the California Republican Party, which was overseeing the turnout operation. Late in the campaign, Trump posted on Truth Social to try to discredit the California vote, without presenting evidence for his claims.\n\nSome Republicans in California said they were privately frustrated by what they saw as an unfocused, disorganized opposition effort and campaign ads \"that looked like they were straight out of the 1980s,\" as one California GOP strategist put it.\n\n\"This was absolutely winnable,\" said Carl DeMaio, a Republican member of the California State Assembly. \"The Democrats messaging was simplified, emotional and very sharp. Our side basically went with a civics lesson approach.\"\n\nSeveral weeks before the election, public polling showed Newsom's side opening a clear lead. And in October -- at a moment when the state's 23 million voters had gotten their ballots -- data from AdImpact showed that the \"no\" side had gone dark on broadcast, cable and satellite and had no major ad buys reserved for the final weeks of the campaign.\n\nThe Newsom side saw Obama as their most effective surrogate and the ad he filmed stating that democracy is on the ballot Nov. 4 and that Republicans were trying to \"rig the next election and wield unchecked power,\" ran in heavier rotation than any other spot.\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump made it clear that the Nov. 4 election would not be the final phase of the battle. He called the redistricting vote in California \"a GIANT SCAM,\" adding that the measure and election results were \"under very serious legal and criminal review.\"\n\n\"STAY TUNED,\" he wrote.\n\nFor the last 11 weeks, Trump \"intentionally kept a low profile,\" said one person familiar with the president's strategy, but litigation is all but certain to follow: \"It's not over on Election Day.\"\n\nNewsom responded to Trump on social media Tuesday. \"The ramblings of an old man that knows he's about to LOSE,\" he wrote on X.",

    "body": "Paul Gigot hosts a 'Journal Editorial Report' panel to discuss California's upcoming special election to vote on Gov. Gavin Newsom's Prop 50, which some criticize as gerrymandering, and the upcoming Pennsylvania Supreme court justice retention vote.\n\nCalifornia voters have passed a ballot initiative that will have a huge impact on next year's battle for the U.S. House majority.\n\nAccording to the Fox News Decision Desk, voters in California approved Proposition 50, which would dramatically alter the state's congressional districts, putting the left-leaning state front-and-center in the high-stakes political fight over redistricting that pits President Donald Trump and the GOP against the Democrats.\n\nApproval of the ballot initiative in the nation's most populous state will temporarily sidetrack California's nonpartisan redistricting commission and return the power to draw the congressional maps to the Democrat-dominated legislature.\n\nThe effort in California, which could create five more Democratic-leaning congressional districts, aims to counter the passage in the reliable red state of Texas of a new map that aims to create up to five right-leaning House seats. Failure to approve what's known as Proposition 50 would have been a stinging setback for Democrats.\n\nOBAMA ENDORSES NEWSOM CALIFORNIA REDISTRICTING PROP 50\n\nTwo-term Gov. Gavin Newsom, who is seen as a likely 2028 Democratic presidential contender, spearheaded the push to pass the proposition.\n\n\"If we lose here, we are going to have total Republican control in the House, the Senate and the White House for at least two more years,\" Newsom emphasized in a recent fundraising appeal to supporters. \"If we win here, we can put a check on Trump for his final two years.\"\n\nHEAD HERE FOR THE LATEST FOX NEWS REPORTING, ANALYSIS, ON 2025 ELECTIONS\n\nThe push by Trump and Republicans for a rare mid-decade redistricting is part of a broad effort by the GOP to pad its razor-thin House majority to keep control of the chamber in the 2026 midterms, when the party in power traditionally faces political headwinds and loses seats.\n\nTrump and his political team are aiming to prevent what happened during his first term in the White House, when Democrats reclaimed the House majority in the 2018 midterm elections.\n\nMissouri last month joined Texas as the second GOP-controlled state to pass congressional redistricting ahead of next year's elections. The new map in Missouri is likely to give the GOP another right-leaning seat.\n\nAnd North Carolina's Republican-controlled legislature also passed a new map which is likely to score another congressional seat for the GOP. Republican-controlled Indiana is on deck, with a special legislative session getting underway this week.\n\nBut unlike those states, California voters needed to weigh in before giving redistricting power back to the legislature in Sacramento.\n\n\"Heaven help us if we lose,\" Newsom said in a fundraising pitch. \"This is an all-hands-on-deck moment for Democrats.\"\n\nFIVE KEY 2025 RACES TO WATCH\n\nProponents and opponents of Proposition 50 raised hundreds of millions of dollars in fundraising, with much of the money being dished out to pay for a deluge of ads on both sides.\n\nOne of the two main groups countering Newsom and the Democrats labeled their effort \"Stop Sacramento's Power Grab.\"\n\nGetting into the fight was former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, who was the last Republican governor of California.\n\nDuring his tenure as governor, Schwarzenegger had a starring role in the passage of constitutional amendments in California in 2008 and 2010 that took the power to draw state legislative and congressional districts away from politicians and placed it in the hands of an independent commission.\n\nNORTHERN CALIFORNIA VOTERS WEIGH IN ON PROP 50 REDISTRICTING FIGHT\n\n\"That's what they want to do is take us backwards -- this is why it is important for you to vote no on Prop 50,\" Schwarzenegger said in an ad against Proposition 50. \"Democracy -- we've got to protect it, and we've got to go and fight for it.\"\n\nBut as Election Day neared in California, the Yes forces had dramatically outraised the No forces, and public opinion polling indicated majority support for the proposition.\n\nEven before Trump initiated his redistricting push, Ohio was under court order to redraw its maps. That could boost Republicans in a one-time battleground state that now leans right.\n\nRepublicans in GOP-dominated Florida are also mulling congressional redistricting. And Democrats in heavily blue Maryland are weighing a redistricting push, while the Democrat-controlled legislature in Virginia is already pushing redistricting.\n\nCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nOther states considering altering their maps are Democrat-dominated Illinois and red states Kansas and Nebraska.\n\nMeanwhile, Democrats could possibly pick up a seat in Republican-dominated Utah, due to a new, more competitive map, mandated by a judge.",

    "body": "California Gov. Gavin Newsom's costly Prop 50 vanity project coasted to victory Tuesday, paving the way for Democrats to flip five crucial congressional seats in the 2026 midterms.\n\nThe Associated Press called the results promptly at 8 p.m. local time, right when polls closed.\n\nThe partisan measure, spearheaded by Newsom, was introduced by the Democratic-led Legislature in direct response to GOP-driven redistricting in Texas that also aims at gaining five additional congressional seats.\n\nThe possibility of losing five seats would be a major blow for California Republicans, who currently hold only nine of the state's 52 congressional seats.\n\nTuesday's tit-for-tat special election has been highly publicized and criticized for its cost, as it's estimated to cost taxpayers over $200 million, at a time when the state is already under great fiscal pressure.\n\nCost aside, Newsom still got plenty of support for Prop 50 from his famous Dem friends. Former President Barack Obama and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez both appeared on ad campaigns pushing the initiative to the state's nearly 40 million people. Former Vice President Kamala Harris also pushed Prop 50.\n\n\"Republicans want to steal enough seats in Congress to rig the next election and wield unchecked power for two more years,\" Obama said in one ad. \"You can stop Republicans in their tracks.\"\n\nFormer California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger railed against Prop 50, telling CNN's Jake Tapper, \"Texas started it. They did something terribly wrong. And then all of a sudden, California says, 'Well, then we have to do something terribly wrong.' And then now other states are jumping in.\"\n\nThe former \"Governator\" said Prop 50 would \"take the power away from the people.\"\n\nThe drawing of electoral maps within the state is now in the hands of the California Legislature, suspending an independent body -- the California Citizens Redistricting Commission (CRC) -- until after the 2030 US Census.\n\nThe newly proposed lines will edge out conservative-leaning districts in the north and south of the state, and split more cities and counties among three or more districts in contrast to only two.\n\nOpponents of the redistricting argue fairness when it comes to representation in minority communities, but the new map won't jeopardize minority votes, according to an analysis by the Public Policy Institute of California.\n\nThe maps may aid in flipping Democratic seats in the House come the 2026 midterms and complicate President Trump's Republican agenda moving forward. Dems need to gain three seats in the midterms to take control of the House.\n\nThis is a political win for Newsom, who staunchly backed the proposition as a flex to go toe to toe with Trump amid speculation that he's eyeing a 2028 presidential bid.",

Gavin Newsom and legislative Democrats that will redraw the state's congressional districts.\n\nThe measure is intended to make several Republican-held congressional districts in California more favorable to Democrats in the 2026 midterm elections in an effort to counter recent redistricting in states including Texas that favors Republicans.\n\nProposition 50 was approved by the Legislature and signed by Newsom on Aug. 21, allowing it to go before voters for a Nov. 4 special election.\n\nHere's what to know about Proposition 50 and California's special election.\n\nIt could take several days to count all mail-in ballots, as California accepts ballots postmarked by Election Day and received within seven days.\n\nProposition 50 will replace California's current congressional district maps that were drawn by the independent California Citizens Redistricting Commission after the 2020 U.S. Census. New maps, crafted by the state Legislature, would redraw the state's congressional districts to make five Republican-held U.S. House seats in California more favorable for Democrats in the 2026 midterm elections.\n\nCalifornia Democrats have called Proposition 50 a countermeasure to Texas' recent redistricting push that was backed by President Trump and created five Republican-friendly congressional seats in that state.\n\nCalifornia voters approved the creation of the independent redistricting commission earlier this century to oversee the congressional mapmaking process. The commission uses census data and public input to set district boundaries that reflect population changes and keep communities together.\n\nIf voters had rejected Proposition 50, California would have continued using its current congressional district boundaries until new maps were drawn by the redistricting commission after the 2030 Census.\n\nGov. Newsom and top Democratic leaders, including many who are trying to succeed him in California's 2026 gubernatorial race, have championed Proposition 50.\n\nOther major supporters of Proposition 50 include billionaire investors George Soros and Tom Steyer, and former President Barack Obama, who featured in a Yes on 50 campaign ad, calling on voters to approve the ballot measure.\n\nSupporters argue that Proposition 50 defends democracy and restores fairness after redistricting efforts in GOP-led states like Texas.\n\nFormer Republican California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger has criticized the redistricting effort, saying the initiative \"doesn't make sense.\" Schwarzenegger has also appeared in ads that oppose Proposition 50.\n\nOthers who oppose the initiative include Republican political donor Charles Munger, Jr., who contributed more than $32.7 million, and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy.\n\nOpponents argue that Proposition 50 is gerrymandering and that California should maintain its standard for fair redistricting through independent, citizen-led redistricting.\n\nProposition 50 was placed on the ballot by the California Legislature earlier this year.\n\nLawmakers approved the measure during a special session in August, and Newsom's signature set the stage for this statewide special election.\n\nAmong California's 52 congressional districts, Democrats represent 43 while Republicans represent nine.\n\nProposition 50 was created to redraw congressional districts to make five of them currently held by GOP House members more favorable to being won by Democrats in next year's midterms. Still, there is no guarantee that Democrats will win the seats even though voters have approved the new maps.\n\nThe five Republican-led congressional districts most targeted under Proposition 50 are Rep. Doug LaMalfa's District 1, Rep. Kevin Kiley's District 3, Rep. David Valadao's District 22, Rep. Ken Calvert's District 41, and Rep. Darrell Issa's District 48.",

    "title": "California Approves New House Maps in a Major Win for Democrats and Newsom",
    "body": "California voters agreed Tuesday to aggressively redraw the state's congressional district lines to wipe out as many as five Republican seats, according to The Associated Press, delivering a major victory for national Democrats hoping to wrest control of the House of Representatives in 2026.\n\nGavin Newsom, the state's Democratic governor, had championed the ballot measure, successfully selling it as an emergency response to President Trump's efforts to press Republican states across the country to redraw their own boundaries for political advantage.\n\nIt's now possible that Democrats could hold as many as 48 of California's 52 seats after 2026, up from the party's current 43 seats.\n\nRedistricting wars have spread nationwide since the summer, when Republicans carved as many as five new congressional seats for the party in Texas. The passage of new maps in California represents the first and most significant swing back in favor of Democrats.\n\nRepublicans currently hold a mere three-seat majority in the House, and control of the chamber is the Democratic Party's best chance to take any power in Washington next year and thus thwart Mr. Trump's agenda in the second half of his second term.\n\nMr. Newsom and a parade of national Democrats had pitched the redistricting measure as a necessary maneuver by the left to counteract Mr. Trump's bending of the typical rules of political engagement. They called it the Election Rigging Response Act, purposefully naming it Proposition 50 in reference to the 50 U.S. states, symbolizing the nationwide scope of the fight.\n\nBut even more than that, Mr. Newsom aimed to turn the redistricting campaign into more of a partisan referendum on Mr. Trump than on gerrymandering, successfully taking advantage of California's political tilt to the left.\n\nThere are now legal, legislative and political fights over redistricting in more than a half-dozen states, including Indiana, Virginia, New York, Ohio, North Carolina, Missouri, Illinois and Florida.\n\nCongressional maps are typically reconfigured each decade, only after the census. But Mr. Trump has pushed Republican-controlled states to adopt partisan new maps that erase Democratic seats this year to improve Republican chances to keep power in the House. He has succeeded so far in Missouri, Texas and North Carolina. Democrats control fewer statehouses, and in some of those places, including California, they had previously ceded mapmaking authority.\n\nMore than a decade ago, California voters had stripped politicians of partisan mapmaking powers, handing control to an independent citizens commission. But Mr. Newsom persuaded state legislators in Sacramento this summer -- and ultimately the public on Tuesday -- to roll back those reforms. Voters agreed to rewrite the California Constitution, installing the heavily gerrymandered maps favoring Democrats until the next census in order to offset congressional Republican gains elsewhere.\n\nSupporters of the independent commission lamented the outcome, saying it was a mistake for the state to revert to partisan map-drawing after embracing a reform that created more competitive races.\n\n\"For what looms for the people of California, I am saddened by the passage of Proposition 50,\" Charles T. Munger Jr., a longtime champion of independent redistricting and the largest donor against the measure.\n\nMr. Munger, a Republican, added that Californians must ensure that the state will revert to having maps drawn by its independent commission after the 2030 census.\n\nMr. Newsom raised more than $100 million in three months for a campaign that cemented his status as one of the nation's leading antagonists to Mr. Trump, and his position as a serious potential Democratic presidential contender in 2028.\n\nHis office's all-caps social media posts that mocked Mr. Trump's caustic style with dripping sarcasm went viral. And Mr. Newsom's full embrace of battling -- and baiting -- Mr. Trump became a comforting salve for a Democratic base that has been crying out for a more full-throated response to a president seen by the left as fraying the basic fabric of democracy.\n\nEarly on, the redistricting ballot fight was expected to be highly competitive.\n\nMr. Munger, a physicist and heir to a business fortune who had supported the initial redistricting reforms in the state, poured more than $30 million into stopping Mr. Newsom. But his donations mostly dried up soon after Labor Day, and so did other funding against the measure.\n\nFormer Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican who had counted stripping politicians of their map-drawing powers as one of his administration's major accomplishments, publicly spoke out against the measure but did little else to mobilize opposition.\n\nBy October, Mr. Newsom and his allies mostly had the airwaves to themselves in a state where television ads are still king. All told, proponents spent roughly $99 million on advertising online and on television compared with nearly $39 million in opposition, according to data from AdImpact, an ad-tracking service.\n\nThe one-sided deluge caused Mr. Newsom to tell small donors to stop giving any more money more than a week before the election, an unusual declaration that showed how confident his team had become.\n\nThe closing ad in support of Proposition 50 distilled much of the strategy from Mr. Newsom's team: rallying Democrats to the polls in a Democratic state to stand up to Mr. Trump.\n\nIt featured former President Barack Obama, Mr. Newsom, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and even Representative Jasmine Crockett of Texas, a firebrand who has become a favorite of the progressive base.\n\nThe new maps approved by voters will significantly scramble California's congressional delegation, which is the nation's largest, with 52 members.\n\nFor three Republicans -- Representatives Kevin Kiley and Doug LaMalfa in Northern California, and Representative Ken Calvert in Southern California -- the political complexion of their districts has completely changed from safe Republican redoubts to relative Democratic strongholds.\n\nThe districts of two other Republicans, Representatives David Valadao in the Central Valley and Darrell Issa in Southern California, will become more competitive seats that Democrats hope to flip.\n\nBut all of that does not capture how thoroughly the new map favors Democrats.\n\nThe new lines also simultaneously strengthened the party's position in a half-dozen other potentially competitive seats held by Democrats: Representatives George Whitesides, Mike Levin, Dave Min, Derek Tran, Adam Gray and Josh Harder.\n\nThe new congressional lines approved under Proposition 50 will be in place for elections in 2026, 2028 and 2030. After the next census, California's independent redistricting commission will again be charged with drawing the state's maps.",

    "body": "The proposition marks Democrats' first foray into what some have described as the \"redistricting arms race,\" as both parties gear up for 2026.\n\nVoters in California have given Gov. Gavin Newsom the green light to redraw the state's congressional maps ahead of next year's midterm elections.\n\nNBC News' Decision Desk projected resounding approval for Proposition 50, which will allow the state to temporarily scrap its independent redistricting commission and use a more Democratic-friendly congressional map in 2026.\n\nThe measure, which was put on the ballot in August, was a direct response to Donald Trump's efforts to redraw congressional maps in his party's favor in several Republican-controlled states across the country. Democrats in California are expected to net five additional seats in the House next year to counter the five seats Republicans are likely to gain in Texas.\n\nBefore Tuesday's vote, Newsom accused Trump of \"rigging the game,\" and said this was his state's chance to \"fight fire with fire.\"\n\nUnder Newsom's plan, Democrats could control as many as 48 of the state's 52 congressional seats -- up from the 43 seats the party currently holds.\n\nProposition 50's passage marks Democrats' first foray into what some have described as the \"redistricting arms race,\" as both parties seek to improve their electoral chances ahead of 2026.\n\nThe proposition was backed by several high-profile Democrats, including former President Barack Obama and former Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nIn one ad, the former president said the legislation would put \"our elections back on a level playing field,\" and told Californians they had the power to \"stop Republicans in their tracks.\"\n\nTypically, states commission new congressional maps every 10 years using U.S. census data. The last set of maps, drawn in 2020, was expected to be used until 2030.\n\nEarlier this year, at the president's urging, Republicans in several states started that process in the middle of the decade in an effort to defend the party's razor-thin majority in the House.\n\nTrump's push began in Texas in July, when he asked Republicans to schedule a special session to consider new maps.\n\nAfter a high-profile fight with the state's Democrats, which included dozens of lawmakers leaving Texas in protest, Republicans passed the gerrymandered maps and Gov. Greg Abbott signed off on the legislation in August.\n\nTrump then expanded his pressure campaign to other states, with Missouri and North Carolina following Texas' lead. Indiana is set to convene a special session in December to consider new congressional districts, and Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida has called for a special session to redraw his state's maps.",

Gavin Newsom's wife just proved that she and her husband reside in a house that claps back.\n\nDuring a Monday press conference in San Francisco to urge voters to support Prop. 50, a California measure funding affordable housing and homelessness programs, California First Partner Jennifer Siebel Newsom shifted her focus toward the \"fight for democracy\" and how she plans to raise her four children -- Montana, 16; Hunter, 14; Brooklyn, 12; and Dutch, 9 -- during President Donald Trump's time in office.\n\n\"I will not raise my children to think Donald Trump is an acceptable American leader,\" Sibel Newsom stated. \"Nor that he is what the leader of our great country should behave like. I won't raise them to think his terror enables his power and that his greed equals success. He is the exact opposite of what real strength looks like.\"\n\nThe former actor went on to say that she and her husband will continue to instill the values of \"what strength really looks like,\" which includes \"always, always telling the truth\" -- a quality she believes Trump's parents failed to teach him, and one whose absence has contributed to the current state of the country.\n\n\"On the contrary, Trump is enriching his immediate family and cronies,\" she said. \"He is stripping away our rights and our democracy. When he knows he's going to lose, he cheats. When the game isn't rigged for him, he rigs it himself.\"\n\nSibel Newsom was met with resounding applause at this point in her speech, but her takedown of Trump was far from over.\n\n\"He's a con artist, a predator, a malignant narcissist-in-chief, and the worst president in our nation's history,\" she exclaimed.",

    "body": "Democrat-controlled California will reportedly keep rolling out the red carpet for illegal aliens in the 2025-2026 budget period while shoving state police officers to the side.\n\nPer the Daily Caller, Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) is doing what many Democrats in other states have done when it comes to illegals and health care, the outlet reported Tuesday.\n\nThe article stated:\n\nDemocratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom's final budget allocates $348 million to law enforcement while the state's own budget experts in an October report estimate the tab for giving full health benefits for illegal aliens amounts to $10 billion. The new report by the state's Legislative Analyst's Office (LAO) reveals a 35% higher figure than the $7.4 billion cost Newsom estimated in his January 2025 budget proposal.\n\nCalifornia's joint state-federal Medicaid program, Medi-Cal, provides comprehensive coverage for doctor's visits, medications, and dental and vision care for 1.7 million illegal aliens, who represent 11% of the program's enrollees, according to the LAO report. Illegal immigrants' health benefits will consume a fourth of the Medi-Cal money flowing from state coffers.\n\nMany leftists with social justice and open borders lobbying groups, some with links to billionaire George Soros, have demanded the federal government stop funding police across the nation, Breitbart News reported in 2020.\n\nIn addition, Democrat-run Oregon is reportedly on track to spend $500 million more on a program that gives free health care to illegal migrants than for its state police, according to a Breitbart News article published in October:\n\nOregon is one of the Democrat-dominated states that went all-in for free healthcare programs for illegals during the Biden years. But three other deep blue states that made similar moves on health care for migrants have begun pulling back on these promises because the programs are massive budget busters.\n\nCalifornia, Illinois, and Minnesota all launched massive health care giveaways to illegals over the last four years, but all three are paring back their programs after costs soared tens of millions beyond what was initially proposed.\n\nMeanwhile, Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA) admitted in October that the government shutdown fight is over Democrats seeking to give taxpayer funded health care to illegals, Breitbart News reported. Now, police officers in Democrat-run areas across America are apparently fed up with illegals getting billions in funds while they get ignored, according to the outlet.",

    "body": "DRIVING THE DAY: Sen. Alex Padilla announced this afternoon that he won't run for California governor, ending months of speculation.\n\n\"It is with a full heart and even more commitment than ever that I am choosing to not run for governor of California next year,\" Padilla said at a Capitol Hill news conference on the federal government shutdown. \"I choose not just to stay in the Senate, I choose to stay in this fight.\"\n\nHad he elected to run, Padilla would have upended a still-crowded field vying to succeed Gavin Newsom.\n\nTHAT'S A WRAP: The conclusion of California's blockbuster redistricting campaign today will end a two-month-long messaging battle that dominated the state's airwaves.\n\nIt was a lopsided fight, with Democrats far outspending Republicans. But the choices that each side made in their advertising reflected two distinct approaches to a measure that polls suggest is poised to pass comfortably.\n\nNewsom and the proponents of Proposition 50 -- which would gerrymander the state's congressional maps to add five blue seats -- leaned on famous Democrats, including a heavy dose of the governor himself. They spent millions blasting his face across TV screens throughout the state, even in red areas where he's not as popular, according to an analysis of broadcast and cable ad spending provided to Playbook by the tracking firm Amplify, a Democratic firm that is not involved in the race.\n\nOpponents of the measure spent more on ads using local leaders (as well as actors) to argue that the measure would hurt voters by suspending the state's independent redistricting commission. And despite Republicans clamoring to get former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger more involved in the campaign, a spot featuring him had less money behind it.\n\nBroadcast and cable ads reach only a slice of voters in today's digital-heavy environment. This is especially true of the Yes on 50, which spent big on digital ads. The campaign used linear media (broadcast, cable and radio) for roughly 40 percent of its paid ads. It placed 60 percent on digital platforms, which include online platforms and streaming services.\n\nEven so, TV ads provide a snapshot of a campaign's priorities. Here are five takeaways from the two campaigns' TV ad buys.\n\nYes on 50 highlighted Newsom, even in areas where he's less popular. The governor and likely 2028 presidential candidate appeared in three ads: one speaking at the campaign launch event, another talking direct-to-camera and a third featuring him alongside a group of other Democratic leaders.\n\nAll three aired on cable throughout the state, including Bakersfield and Fresno in the Central Valley and Chico and Redding in Northern California, according to Amplify.\n\nThe first ad showing the governor at the launch rally aired on broadcast markets only in the four biggest markets: Los Angeles, Sacramento-Stockton-Modesto, San Diego and San Francisco-Oakland-San Jose. But the other two also aired in Fresno, as well as several smaller areas.\n\nBearstar Strategies, Newsom's go-to political firm, said it took the governor's popularity in certain parts of the state into consideration. But the campaign's data won out, as the direct-to-camera spot was one of their top testing ads.\n\nThe Yes side spent the most money airing an ad highlighting Padilla's handcuffing after a news conference hosted by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. The campaign paid more than $5.4 million for the spot, which shows the incident over audio of the senator saying, \"When Donald Trump's agents threw me to the ground, they were trying to silence all of us.\"\n\nIt spent an additional $1.3 million on a Spanish-language version of the ad that aired in Fresno, Los Angeles and San Diego.\n\nBearstar said the bigger ad buy could be related to the overall amount the campaign was spending at the time they reserved the broadcast and cable time. Regardless, the spots seemed more significant for Padilla before he announced he will not run for governor, giving him statewide exposure at a time when he was considering entering the race.\n\nThe top ad for No on 50 did not feature Schwarzenegger, the celebrity ace in the hole for the opposition. Instead, the Charles Munger Jr.-backed Protect Voters First campaign spent more than $8.8 million on a spot showing Yorba Linda Mayor Janice Kim and the Rev. Mac Shorty of South Los Angeles touting California's independent redistricting commission and saying Prop 50 would \"[destroy] our reputation as a national leader for fair elections.\"\n\nIn contrast, the campaign paid about $1.9 million for the spot featuring Schwarzenegger, the only well-known Republican figure who appeared in No-side TV ads. The commercials with Kim and Shorty ran on cable and broadcast for nearly a month, while the Schwarzenegger ads were up for about a week.\n\nBillionaire Tom Steyer spent the most on a single ad for the Yes side, much to Democrats' chagrin. The possible gubernatorial candidate jumped into the Prop 50 fray in October, when he spent about $8.1 million on a spot showing a Trump imitator angrily reacting to a Prop 50 victory.\n\nIt was one of two ads from Steyer, who appears in the second one -- which he paid about $3.1 million to air -- to talk about the impeachment campaign he ran during Trump's first term. Some Democrats were furious about Steyer's ads, which critics cast as a counterproductive exercise in profile raising.\n\nThe Yes campaign highlighted top Dems, while the No side focused on \"everyday Californians.\" In addition to Newsom and Padilla, the Yes side employed former President Barack Obama to deliver the pro-Prop 50 argument. The campaign's closing ad also brought in New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Texas Rep. Jasmine Crockett, California Rep. Lateefah Simon and Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy.\n\nAmy Thoma Tan of Protect Voters First told Playbook the No side wanted to take a different approach with its messaging. \"The Yes side, it wasn't a surprise to us that they highlighted partisan politicians who stand to benefit from this,\" she said. \"And we tried to really focus our campaign on everyday Californians who are impacted by it.\"\n\n-- with help from Melanie Mason\n\nIT'S ELECTION DAY.

Got tips or suggestions? Shoot an email to [email protected].\n\nPUMMELING PROP 50 : Trump finally weighed in on today's California redistricting election, claiming on Truth Social it's unconstitutional and the state's largely vote-by-mail elections are \"rigged\" against Republicans.\n\nWhile the president indicated that California's processes were under review, he did not elaborate on which entities might be looking at the state's mail-in voting rules, Cheyanne M. Daniels reports. Trump's administration today plans to send federal election monitors to several California counties to observe the state's election.\n\nThe president attacked the Golden State's Democratic gerrymandering bid even as he encourages Republican-led states to redraw their congressional districts ahead of next year's midterms. California leaders want voters to approve a map with five new blue seats in response to Texas doing the same with red districts at the president's behest.\n\n\"The Unconstitutional Redistricting Vote in California is a GIANT SCAM in that the entire process, in particular the Voting itself, is RIGGED,\" wrote Trump, who has frequently, and without evidence, questioned the validity of elections.\n\nSNAP CONFUSION: Trump today threatened to withhold federal food aid funding until Democrats agree to end the shutdown, although White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt l ater said the administration will comply with a court order requiring it to disperse the money.\n\nA Trump Truth Social post saying food benefits \"will be given only when the Radical Left Democrats open up government\" created widespread confusion as states, anti-hunger groups and lawmakers attempt to understand the federal government's next steps, Gregory Svirnovskiy and Marcia Brown report.\n\nEven officials within the Trump administration weren't clear on whether the post meant USDA wouldn't abide by the court order and release money for SNAP, according to four people with direct knowledge of the matter, who were granted anonymity to share private details.\n\nA few hours later, Leavitt said during a White House press briefing \"the administration is fully complying with the court order. I just spoke to the president about it.\"\n\n\"The president does not want to have to tap into this fund in the future,\" Leavitt said. \"That's what he was referring to in his Truth Social post.\"\n\nRELEASE THE FUNDS: The Trump administration cannot withhold billions of dollars in transportation funding to states that refuse to cooperate with immigration enforcement, a federal judge in Rhode Island ruled today.\n\nChief U.S. District Judge John McConnell wrote in his ruling that the U.S. Department of Transportation and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy \"blatantly overstepped\" their authority in attempting to link funding used to maintain roads, bridges and highways to immigration demands, Alex Nieves reports.\n\n\"The Constitution demands the Court set aside this lawless behavior,\" McConnell wrote.\n\nThe decision represents another victory for Democrat-led states that have countered DOT's attempts to disrupt transportation funding, including $5 billion for electric vehicle chargers that a judge in June ordered the Trump administration to unfreeze.\n\n\"If President Trump wants to stop losing in court, he should stop breaking the law,\" California Attorney General Rob Bonta said in a statement today. \"The courts have repeatedly and firmly rejected the Trump Administration's efforts to infringe on states' constitutional right to set their own policy priorities.\"\n\nTOP OF TECH: Tech's Big Five companies poured $5.7 million into lobbying state agencies and lawmakers as the legislative session drew to a close. That's more than double what those companies (Microsoft, Apple, Google, Amazon and Meta) paid last spring, according to an analysis of third-quarter disclosures by our colleague Christine Mui for POLITICO Pro's California Decoded newsletter.\n\nMeta was solely responsible for $3.4 million of that amount. That's over six times the cost of its spring lobbying operation, which already set the record as the most it had dropped in a single quarter. And it was enough to lead Decoded's list of the top tech and telecom lobbying spenders in California from July through September.\n\nThe company declined to comment on what was behind the surge. But it reported lobbying on everything from state Sen. Scott Wiener's AI transparency and safety push, SB 53, to Assemblymember Buffy Wicks' AB 1043 on online age verification.\n\nVerizon followed with a tab that reached $2.2 million, or a more than 470 percent increase compared with the quarter before. Almost all of it was driven by lobbying of the California Public Utilities Commission, an effort that grew from about $82,000 in the spring to $1.9 million by Q3.\n\nIt's been pushing the state utility regulator to approve a $20 billion acquisition of Frontier ahead of next year. Concerns remain unresolved over Verizon's rollback of DEI policies to win the blessing of Federal Communications Chair Brendan Carr this May.\n\nIn third place was Google, whose $1.7 million in lobbying payments also ranked seventh among all types of companies and groups.

    "body": "In New York City -- where a 34-year-old democratic socialist appears poised to defeat a 67-year-old, scandal-plagued former Democratic governor for mayor -- the contest is stress testing the party's tolerance of its far-left flank and its appetite for younger leaders as it contends with an ongoing identity crisis.\n\nAnd in California, a redistricting ballot measure heavily promoted by Gov. Gavin Newsom is giving Democrats their best chance at countering Trump's aggressive gerrymandering campaign and turbocharging similar efforts in other blue states.\n\nPolls favor Democrats in these contests, leaving them bullish that \"we are writing our party's comeback story,\" as Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) said on a recent Democratic organizing call.\n\nShort of winning, Republicans are hoping to shrink the opposition's margins as they look to avoid a repeat of the backlash to Trump that propelled Democrats to strong victories during his first term. Even if Republicans lose, they're planning to spin any whiff of a Democratic underperformance into a win for themselves.\n\nHere are five key trendlines we're watching this Election Day that will inform the midterms:\n\nIt's all in the margins\n\nThe big test isn't whether Democratic gubernatorial candidates Rep. Mikie Sherrill and former Rep. Abigail Spanberger win -- it's whether they can exceed Kamala Harris' 2024 margins of victory in New Jersey and Virginia, respectively.\n\nBoth states swung hard toward Trump last year, even as they stayed blue. In New Jersey, Trump came within 6 points of toppling Harris after a 16-point loss four years prior. And he halved his margin in Virginia, losing by 5 points in 2024 after trailing by 10 points in 2020.\n\nMost polling shows Spanberger leading by more than 5 points. New Jersey surveys suggest a tighter race between Sherrill and Republican Jack Ciattarelli -- recent polls show Sherrill with a lead ranging from 1 to 10 points -- though polling drastically underestimated Ciattarelli's performance in 2021, when he came within 3 points of unseating Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy.\n\nSherrill's margin will help both parties evaluate whether Republicans' gains in the Garden State have staying power beyond Trump as they shift focus to a pair of battleground House races next year.\n\nThe spin wars have already begun. Democrats say they'll be happy with a win regardless of the percentage. But if Sherrill fails to at least match Harris, Republicans are prepared to declare it a sign of Democrats' struggles -- even if Ciattarelli loses.\n\n\"The polls are looking really good. They're just about even. And they say even for us is a win,\" Trump said on a tele-rally for Ciattarelli Monday night.\n\nDemocrats push to win back Black and Latino voters\n\nKeep an eye on areas with large Black and Latino populations to see whether Democrats' revamped economic messaging is winning back those traditionally blue voters who swung toward Trump last year.\n\nNational Democrats have invested millions across New Jersey and Virginia to reengage with Black and Latino voters.\n\nIn New Jersey, watch for how the vote breaks down in major urban areas like Newark, where more than 80 percent of residents are Black or Latino and where former President Barack Obama campaigned over the weekend. Trump made gains there -- and in other urban areas -- last year. Also look to Passaic County, the plurality-Latino county that Trump flipped in 2024.\n\nIn Virginia, keep tabs on Hampton Roads, where Obama rallied with Spanberger, as well as Northern Virginia and Richmond and its suburbs. Trump peeled voters away from Democrats in all three vote-rich regions last year. A Virginia State University flash poll of Black voters ahead of the election zeroed in on the politically diverse Hampton Roads region as a \"key battleground.\"\n\nThe Trump factor\n\nTrump has taken a largely hands-off approach to New Jersey and Virginia's gubernatorial contests, endorsing Ciattarelli but never even naming Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears and limiting his engagement to tele-rallies. But he still looms, as Democrats look for signs that Trump will once again be a drag on the GOP -- and Republicans try to replicate his coalition when he's not atop the ballot.\n\nHistory isn't on Republicans' side. Voters in New Jersey have elected a governor from the same party as the president just once in 40 years. In Virginia, it's happened only once in 48 years. During Trump's first term, as his approval rating slid below 40 percent, Democrats stormed to victory in both states. His approval rating is only slightly higher now, averaging in the mid 40s.\n\nWhat to watch: A GOP win in either race wouldn't just be an upset; it could upend how the parties approach a midterm cycle that's historically bad for the party in power. Republicans lost 41 House seats in 2018 as anti-Trump sentiment fueled a blue wave. If Trump proves not to be a drag in New Jersey and Virginia, it could be an early indicator that the coming midterms won't fit the mold.\n\nWidespread Republican losses in Virginia, meanwhile, could dim the political prospects for one of Trump's potential successors: Gov. Glenn Youngkin, the one-time GOP rising star who's barred by state law from seeking a consecutive term. Youngkin all but cleared the field for Earle-Sears, who many Republicans considered a weak candidate, and she is running as an extension of his administration. If she loses, it'll be a blow to his legacy -- and any potential presidential aspirations.\n\nDems look to California to turbocharge their redistricting counteroffensive\n\nDemocrats are betting on a big win in California as a way to supercharge redistricting efforts that have been sputtering in other blue states.\n\nHarris' 2024 margin again serves as the benchmark here; she defeated Trump by 21 points in her home state, with nearly 59 percent of the vote. Some public polling shows Proposition 50 with over 60-percent support.\n\nExceeding that threshold could spur skittish Democrats in Illinois and Maryland to get on board with their party's efforts to counter Trump's push to protect Republicans' House majority. And it could help propel a constitutional amendment in Virginia that would pave the way for a mid-decade redraw.\n\nDemocrats need these states to get with the program. Even with a new map in California that could net the party five seats -- offsetting the five Republicans drew for their party to pick up in Texas -- that's only a fraction of the up to 19 seats the GOP is looking to gain across the country.\n\nA small margin of victory -- or a surprise loss -- for Prop 50 could give Trump and his team ammunition to force reticent Republicans in Indiana, Nebraska and New Hampshire to take up new maps. That's even as California Republicans have all but abandoned their opposition effort to the ballot measure.\n\nProposition 50 also stands as a significant test of Newsom's leadership in California and beyond as he mulls a 2028 presidential bid. A win could help cement Newsom as his party's preeminent opposition leader to Trump ahead of contests that will serve as referendums on the Republican's second term.\n\nThe down-ballot wildcard that could split some tickets\n\nDo scandals still matter to voters? Virginia's attorney general race will put that to the test.\n\nThe surfacing of years-old texts in which Democratic nominee Jay Jones mused about violence against political opponents turned the contest into the state's only true tossup.\n\nRepublicans seized on the texts, demanding the Democratic ticket disavow Jones despite him repeatedly apologizing for the remarks. GOP incumbent Jason Miyares has spotlighted the messages in his ads, and is using the scandal to encourage voters casting ballots for Spanberger to split their ticket in the attorney general race. Check the vote tallies to see if they do.\n\nEarly voting was underway by the time the scandal broke, leaving Democrats with no way to replace Jones on the ballot. Jones even appeared at an Obama-headlined campaign rally, getting a warm response from the crowd.\n\nDemocrats are hoping voters will look past Jones' transgressions -- including a reckless-driving scandal.\n\nAnd despite the cloud of scandal shrouding his opponent, Miyares has had trouble getting above roughly 46 percent in most polls, suggesting he -- and Republicans broadly -- has a ceiling in a year expected to be difficult for his party.",

    "body": "Paul Gigot hosts a 'Journal Editorial Report' panel to discuss California's upcoming special election to vote on Gov. Gavin Newsom's Prop 50, which some criticize as gerrymandering, and the upcoming Pennsylvania Supreme court justice retention vote.\n\nIt's Election Day in California, where a ballot initiative will make a huge impact on next year's battle for the U.S. House majority whether it passes or fails.\n\nCalifornia voters are deciding whether to pass a ballot proposition which would dramatically alter the state's congressional districts, putting the left-leaning state front-and-center in the high-stakes political fight over redistricting that pits President Donald Trump and the GOP against the Democrats.\n\nCalifornia state lawmakers this summer approved a special proposition on the November ballot to obtain voter approval to temporarily sidetrack the state's nonpartisan redistricting commission and return the power to draw the congressional maps to the Democrat-dominated legislature. Early voting by mail in the contest has been underway for a month.\n\nThe effort in California, which could create five more Democratic-leaning congressional districts, aims to counter the passage in the reliable red state of Texas of a new map that aims to create up to five right-leaning House seats. Failure to approve what's known as Proposition 50 would be a stinging setback for Democrats.\n\nOBAMA ENDORSES NEWSOM CALIFORNIA REDISTRICTING PROP 50\n\nTwo-term Gov. Gavin Newsom, who is seen as a likely 2028 Democratic presidential contender, is spearheading the push to pass the proposition.\n\n\"If we lose here, we are going to have total Republican control in the House, the Senate and the White House for at least two more years,\" Newsom emphasized in a recent fundraising appeal to supporters. \"If we win here, we can put a check on Trump for his final two years.\"\n\nHEAD HERE FOR THE LATEST FOX NEWS REPORTING, ANALYSIS, ON 2025 ELECTIONS\n\nThe push by Trump and Republicans for a rare mid-decade redistricting is part of a broad effort by the GOP to pad its razor-thin House majority to keep control of the chamber in the 2026 midterms, when the party in power traditionally faces political headwinds and loses seats.\n\nTrump and his political team are aiming to prevent what happened during his first term in the White House, when Democrats reclaimed the House majority in the 2018 midterm elections.\n\nMissouri last month joined Texas as the second GOP-controlled state to pass congressional redistricting ahead of next year's elections. The new map in Missouri is likely to give the GOP another right-leaning seat.\n\nAnd North Carolina's Republican-controlled legislature also passed a new map, which is likely to score another congressional seat for the GOP. Republican-controlled Indiana is on deck, with a special legislative session getting underway this week.\n\nBut unlike those states, California voters need to weigh in before giving redistricting power back to the legislature in Sacramento.\n\n\"Heaven help us if we lose,\" Newsom said in a fundraising pitch. \"This is an all-hands-on-deck moment for Democrats.\"\n\nFIVE KEY 2025 RACES TO WATCH\n\nProponents and opponents of Proposition 50 raised hundreds of millions of dollars in fundraising, with much of the money being dished out to pay for a deluge of ads on both sides.\n\nOne of the two main groups countering Newsom and the Democrats labeled their effort \"Stop Sacramento's Power Grab.\"\n\nGetting into the fight was former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, who was the last Republican governor of California.\n\nDuring his tenure as governor, Schwarzenegger had a starring role in the passage of constitutional amendments in California in 2008 and 2010 that took the power to draw state legislative and congressional districts away from politicians and placed it in the hands of an independent commission.\n\nNORTHERN CALIFORNIA VOTERS WEIGH IN ON PROP 50 REDISTRICTING FIGHT\n\n\"That's what they want to do is take us backwards -- this is why it is important for you to vote no on Prop 50,\" Schwarzenegger said in an ad against Proposition 50. \"Democracy -- we've got to protect it, and we've got to go and fight for it.\"\n\nBut as Election Day neared in California, the Yes forces had dramatically outraised the No forces, and public opinion polling indicated majority support for the proposition.\n\nEven before Trump initiated his redistricting push, Ohio was under court order to redraw its maps. That could boost Republicans in a one-time battleground state that now leans right.\n\nRepublicans in GOP-dominated Florida are also mulling congressional redistricting. And Democrats in heavily blue Maryland are weighing a redistricting push, while the Democrat-controlled legislature in Virginia is already pushing redistricting.\n\nCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nOther states considering altering their maps are Democrat-dominated Illinois and red states Kansas and Nebraska.\n\nMeanwhile, Democrats could possibly pick up a seat in Republican-dominated Utah, due to a new, more competitive map, mandated by a judge.",

    "body": "Related: Southern California's guide to Prop. 50, the 2025 redistricting election\n\nBacked by Gov. Gavin Newsom and prominent Democrats across the country, the changes to congressional districts are meant to give the state's Democratic Party a boost in the upcoming midterm elections, a counter to similar gerrymandering efforts in Republican-led states at the behest of President Donald Trump.\n\nFor those who haven't yet cast a ballot, there's still time.\n\nPolls are open today from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m.\n\nAnd remember, if you're in line to vote when the clock strikes 8, you can stay in line and still vote. Poll workers are instructed, per the secretary of state, to prohibit anyone who arrives after 8 p.m. from voting, but people who are in line are still allowed to cast their ballots.\n\nBallots postmarked by today, Nov. 4, and received by the county registrar's office by Nov. 12, will be counted in the election.\n\nThat being said, California officials encouraged voters who wished to vote by mail to do so early due to concerns that residents who live more than 50 miles from a U.S. Postal Service regional mail processing hub wouldn't have a guarantee that their ballot would be postmarked that same day.\n\nAnd just make sure that if you're submitting a mail ballot, you sign that envelope.\n\nThe ongoing federal government shutdown is not expected to impact Election Day or ballot counting in any way, state officials have said. The U.S. Postal Service's operations are an independent agency funded by the sale of its products and services, and it is prepared for an influx of mail because of the election and holiday season, Natashi Garvins, a spokesperson for the U.S. Postal Service in Southern California, has said.\n\nAs for when Californians will start seeing results in the Proposition 50 election, that somewhat depends on just how early people voted.\n\nThe first batch of election results will be released shortly after polls close on Tuesday, Nov. 4, at 8 p.m., per the secretary of state's schedule. These are semi-official results from mailed and early-voting ballots processed ahead of Election Day.\n\nState law provides time for voters to correct, or \"cure,\" a ballot if issues arise.\n\nFor example, if a voter forgets to sign their signature on a vote-by-mail envelope or the signature doesn't match the one on file with elections offices, they're contacted and given a chance to remedy the issue.\n\nThe cure deadline for the special election is Nov. 30 at 5 p.m. The secretary of state has until Dec. 12 to certify the statewide results.\n\nAs of Sunday, Nov. 2, more than 6.4 million vote by mail ballots had been returned and accepted, according to data from the secretary of state's office.\n\nA lot is riding on the outcome of the election -- and for some congressional districts more than others.\n\nIn Los Angeles County, the 27th and 42nd congressional districts would be among those most impacted should Proposition 50 pass.\n\nCalifornia's 27th Congressional District in northern L.A. County is represented by Democrat George Whitesides, a prime target for Republicans in the 2026 midterm elections. The district, which encompasses the Antelope Valley and Santa Clarita, has been a competitive district in recent elections, with Democrats and Republicans taking turns winning the seat.\n\nThe district is currently 40% registered Democrats, 30% Republicans and 22% \"no party preference.\" But if Proposition 50 passes, the district would become 42% Democrats, 27% Republicans and 29% no party preference or registered with another party.\n\nUnder the proposed map, the district would continue to include Lancaster, Palmdale and Santa Clarita but lose a chunk of its current northwestern section. It would drop further down into the San Fernando Valley, picking up Reseda and Lake Balboa.\n\nAnd at the southern end of L.A. County, California's 42nd Congressional District, represented now by Democrat Robert Garcia, would see a dramatic change to its boundaries.\n\nThe district is now entirely within L.A. County, but it would shift south into Orange County. The 42nd District would lose Lakewood, Downey and other communities in southeast L.A. County -- Commerce and Huntington Park, to name two -- but would pick up Huntington Beach, Newport Beach and Costa Mesa in Orange County.\n\nThe 42nd District is currently 52% Democrat, 18% Republican and 22% no party preference. Although the district would wind up with more Republican voters, Democrats would still have the advantage if Proposition 50 passes. The district, under the proposed maps, would be 40% registered Democratic voters, 30% Republicans and 28% no party preference or other.\n\nThere would also be a new congressional district created under the Proposition 50 maps.\n\nRep. Linda Sánchez, D-Whittier, is the office holder for California's 38th Congressional District. But under the maps before voters, Whittier would be folded into the 41st District, and a new 38th District would be created that would include the San Gabriel Valley communities of El Monte and Baldwin Park, as well as parts of southeast L.A. County, including Montebello. It would also extend into northeastern Orange County, picking up Yorba Linda.\n\nL.A. County Supervisor Hilda Solis has announced plans to run for this new District 38 if it's created.\n\nSánchez, meanwhile, would have the option of running in the new 41st District, which would include Whittier, Bell Gardens, Downey and Lakewood in L.A. County, as well as La Habra and Brea in northern Orange County.",

    "body": "DECISION DAY -- Polling suggests Democrats are cruising toward a decisive victory in Proposition 50, their effort to gerrymander the state's congressional map ahead of the midterms.\n\nRepublicans, dramatically outspent, appear to have all but abandoned their effort to defeat the measure. Meanwhile, a rally that Gov. Gavin Newsom and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi headlined on Monday in San Francisco felt almost like an early victory lap, with hundreds of union members cheering as Pelosi predicted they would \"win big.\"\n\nBut even if the outcome seems likely, the blockbuster election, one of several off-year contests across the country today, could offer key insights for both parties ahead of the midterm elections.\n\nPlaybook spoke with 10 top consultants, party strategists and election trackers about what they're watching tonight.\n\nTheir responses have been edited for clarity and length.\n\nGale Kaufman, veteran Democratic ballot measure strategist: There's a lot of predicting going on about who's going to vote tomorrow, as opposed to by mail-in ballot. So I want to see who's right. I want to see who actually does vote on Election Day, and whether it is more Republicans than usual, or whether it's a much more mixed turnout, which is what I think is going to happen.\n\nPaul Mitchell, Democratic redistricting data guru: I expect the initial results posted by counties -- which come from mostly mailed in ballots -- to be strongly Yes on Prop 50. We may see something like 62-38 or better with the results as of 9:30 or 10 p.m.\n\nWhat I will be watching for is the clawback when in-person voting numbers roll in. These will be the second wave of results and include a lot of Republicans who don't trust VBM. And if they are massively skewed toward the No side, they could claw back some of the early posted results. To beat Prop 50 this clawback probably needs to pull the measure down to 51-49 or something by the end of the night.\n\nIf those in person votes pull it back to close to even, then we have a week of late ballots to get through before we know if this passes. But if the measure is still up at 54-46 or something, then it is all over and we can call it.\n\nElizabeth Ashford, Los Angeles-based Democratic consultant: Whether the polling was worth a damn. I don't believe in polls so much since waking up to the first Trump presidency in 2016.\n\nRob Stutzman, Sacramento-based Republican consultant: I'll be watching county returns. I'll be interested in seeing if inland working class voters continue to vote differently from wealthier coastal voters, as they did last November.\n\nNancy Tung, chair of the San Francisco Democratic Party: I'm looking for Prop 50 to win by 10 or more points. But no matter how big the margin, San Francisco is going to be the epicenter of the political universe with our state party convention and looking toward the midterms. It's time to get battle ready for 2026.\n\nLindsay Bubar, Los Angeles-based Democratic consultant: I'll be closely looking at Democratic turnout, particularly on whether Dem turnout is higher than usual in key purple districts. Seeing how Dems engage with Proposition 50 may offer insight into enthusiasm in these regions. Tonight, we may get a preview of how competitive those districts will be in 2026 and where we have work left to do.\n\nTal Eslick, independent government affairs consultant and former chief of staff to Republican Rep. David Valadao: When polls close the Yes on Proposition 50 campaign will have outspent their opponents by nearly 3-1. Governor Newsom will likely upend citizen-led independent redistricting in the name of combating President Trump and advancing his own presidential ambitions. This will likely compel more red states across the country to adopt their own aggressive gerrymandering efforts to benefit House Republicans. In the end, Democrats may have fared better in the 2026 midterms without having put their thumbs on the redistricting scale in California.\n\nNick Mirman, Sacramento-based Republican consultant: The rural/urban divide. We know how the anti-Trump Yes on 50 campaign will manifest itself in LA and the Bay Area... but will rural voters throw themselves into the suck zone just to spite the president? A Glenn County olive farmer or a Butte county rice farmer being represented by a liberal Sonoma state senator would qualify for the suck zone. Ditto for a Lodi resident and her two neighbors being repped by three different members of Congress.\n\nSteven Maviglio, Sacramento-based Democratic strategist: Heavily Latino precincts. Are they back to pre-Trump margins that Democrats need to win in swing seats?\n\nJacob Rubashkin, deputy editor at Inside Politics: What's the margin? Because at this point, everyone's pretty sure that this thing is going to pass, but the degree to which it can exceed expectations is important as Democrats enter a much more difficult phase of their redistricting process.\n\nCalifornia was the easy part, which is kind of crazy to think, but they've got to do a lot of arm twisting in Maryland and Illinois, and they've got to win a much more difficult ballot measure contest in Virginia next year. So if this thing limps over the finish line, that is not a vote of confidence at all in this effort. That's going to resound negatively to their efforts in some of these other states.\n\nGOOD MORNING. It's Tuesday. Thanks for waking up with Playbook.

(He voted early, in Marin, on Monday.)\n\nFIRST IN PLAYBOOK: TESTING THE WATERS -- Democratic Rep. Eric Swalwell hasn't ruled out running for governor amid polling that shows he could be a strong contender in the crowded contest -- especially as many party insiders look for an alternative to former Rep. Katie Porter.\n\n\"The next governor has to be a fighter, a protector for the state and match what Governor Newsom is doing right now,\" Swalwell told Playbook on Monday as he walked out of a Prop 50 rally.\n\nHe added, \"I'm focused on 50, and I'll look at it after tomorrow. I've seen the polling, I've been asked by people to look at it.\"\n\nA new poll with an overwhelmingly positive slant toward Swalwell -- suggesting it was commissioned by people supporting him -- put him in a competitive position, running as the No. 2 Democrat in the survey behind Porter. The poll by EMC Research puts former Fox News host Steve Hilton, a Republican consolidating his party's base, in first place with 20 percent support.\n\nIt's unclear who paid for the survey, though Swalwell's camp has said it did not come from the representative. The survey question didn't include Sen. Alex Padilla, who's also considering running in 2026 and would be a top contender in the Democratic field.\n\nCREDIT CHECK -- Tom Steyer isn't waiting for the polls to close to take some credit for Prop 50's likely passage. A spokesperson for the billionaire investor -- and possible contender for governor -- sent out a memo on Monday claiming that his eight-figure spend on Newsom's redistricting measure helped \"push Prop 50 over the finish line.\"\n\nThe memo says the pair of ads, which have stoked speculation the onetime presidential hopeful was building up his profile in advance of a possible run for governor, \"filled critical holes in the Yes effort\" by rallying the Democratic base with an anti-Trump message.\n\n\"In the time Tom Steyer's 'Stick it to Trump' first hit the airwaves to supplement the work of Governor Newsom's Yes effort, Prop 50 went from polling around 50 percent to now being in a strong position to pass. That should be something for us all to celebrate,\" said spokesperson Kevin Liao.\n\nBut the Yes on 50 campaign, which was already irked by Steyer's foray into the contest, doesn't exactly see it that way. For one thing, by the time Steyer's ads began running in early October, the campaign's internal polls found it had already consolidated the support of 90 percent of Democrats.\n\nAnd research by the campaign obtained by Playbook tested 13 pro-Prop 50 ads to rate their effectiveness -- and Steyer's two ads ranked at the very bottom. In Steyer's direct-to-camera ad, 43 percent of respondents agreed that viewing the ad would make them more likely to vote for the measure, while 52 percent disagreed with that statement. The second ad, featuring a Trump impersonator, performed even worse.\n\nBy contrast, the campaign's \"Fight\" ad featuring Newsom had a positive effect on 76 percent of respondents, and an ad featuring Sen. Alex Padilla, also a potential candidate for governor, made 74 percent more likely to vote for Prop 50.\n\n\"Their ads were so ineffective Steyer should demand his money back,\" said a Newsom adviser. -- Melanie Mason\n\nGERRYMANDERING 'EXTRAVAGANZA' -- The most surprising group to back California's Democratic gerrymander are not the self-described independent voters suddenly embracing a partisan power play, or the good-government reformers whose prized redistricting commission Proposition 50 would now eviscerate, Sasha Issenberg writes.\n\nIt is the 43 Democratic members of Congress who helped pay for the new map and sell it to voters, often choosing to redraw their own hard-won districts to help a potential Democratic challenger elsewhere.\n\n\"Historically, that could be really challenging,\" said Tom Bonier, a Democratic data analyst who, over years drawing new maps at the National Committee for an Effective Congress, had to assuage fretful incumbents to choose their party's best interests over their own. \"Because they would be convinced that it's going to doom them.\"\n\nSuch politicians were previously a major bulwark against a practice that political scientists have labeled \"strategic redistricting\" -- in which the timing of a redraw is determined not by metronomic habit but situational opportunity -- that was once common and appears destined to again become a recurring factor in American politics.\n\nRead Sasha's full look at the history and future of gerrymandering here.\n\nPELOSI WATCH -- Pelosi said Monday that media speculation over her potential retirement and others launching campaigns is only building support for her if she decides to run again.\n\n\"You know what that does? That gives me so much support,\" she told CNN's Elex Michaelson. \"People calling me saying, 'I'm for you, I'm for you, I'm for you.\"\n\nThe former speaker, 85, has vowed to stay quiet about her plans until after California's special election on Prop 50. That said, she said she's confident San Franciscans would still support her.\n\n\"I have no doubt that if I decided to run, I would win. That isn't even a question,\" she said. -- Nicole Norman\n\nVACANT HOME VANGUARD -- In spring 2020, activists illegally seized more than a dozen publicly owned, vacant homes in Los Angeles, arguing that the state shouldn't leave its own houses empty during a homelessness crisis, Liam Dillon writes.\n\nSince then, a lot of taxpayer money has gone to preventing others from doing the same.\n\nState officials have spent over $17 million in the last six years on private security firms and extra police patrols to protect hundreds of homes, including dozens that are empty, that were acquired decades ago for a failed freeway expansion through the San Gabriel Valley, according to records obtained by Liam from the California Department of Transportation. Read his full story here.\n\nALL'S QUIET ON THE WESTERN WATER FRONT -- The brewing water crisis on the Colorado River is seemingly tailor-made for MAGA: Seven states, two of them swing states, are sparring over fast-dwindling supplies. There are flailing state and local officials, irate farmers and ranchers, dilapidated dams that were once the pride of American engineering, and an international treaty with Mexico. But Trump isn't wading in; instead, he's left the fight to the technocrats. Read more about why this water war isn't the same as the others that have drawn Trump's barbs in last night's California Climate.\n\nWHEN TECH MEETS SPORTS -- OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Golden State Warriors head coach Steve Kerr may not seem like the most obvious pair for a live interview. But San Francisco convener extraordinaire and Board of Supervisors candidate Manny Yekutiel tried his best at an event Monday night to connect the dots and jobs of two of the most important men in San Francisco.\n\nSome takeaways, from our colleagues Chase DiFeliciantonio and Christine Mui, who attended:\n\nAI risks: Yekutiel asked Altman, given the risks of AI, when did the ends justify the means. Altman said he didn't quite see it that way and noted his job was to make sure AI created more good than bad. People weren't happy with all of the effects of previous technological revolutions, Altman said, \"but most of us would not turn the clock back 1,000 years,\" either.\n\nAI rewards: He also addressed OpenAI's recent coup in getting California sign-off on its long-running, multibillion-dollar corporate restructuring. When asked how all that money is going to be used for good, and where does San Francisco fit in, Altman said he sees the company focusing on the technology improving health science and research as well as managing the world's transition to an AI-powered world.\n\nAs far as the role of San Francisco, Altman doubled down on the city being the company's home and headquarters, a fact California Attorney General Rob Bonta emphasized when giving his green light to the restructuring. Asked later about his vision for San Francisco, Altman said he thought Mayor Daniel Lurie \"was doing an unbelievable job.\"\n\nBut great fortune comes with great responsibility, Yekutiel argued, pointing to Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's $17 billion week and the simultaneous loss of SNAP benefits during the government shutdown as an example of San Francisco's extreme wealth disparity. He asked how they view their role in addressing inequality.\n\n\"First of all, to say the obvious: Jensen isn't the person to blame for people losing their SNAP benefits,\" replied Altman, who defended building a company as a great thing and said successful entrepreneurs should pay it forward.\n\nWOLFF'S GAMBIT -- Patrick Wolff, the former chess grandmaster running for state insurance commissioner, is challenging people across the state to play games of simultaneous, 10 vs. 1 speed chess against him and posting the results on social media in search of a viral moment.\n\nWolff, now a financial analyst in San Francisco, is offering to pay the home or renters' insurance of anyone who beats him. The idea was conceived by Obama alum Mark Putnam, according to Wolff's campaign.\n\nWIENER'S TIMING -- If Rep. Nancy Pelosi is indeed going to retire, should state Sen. Scott Wiener have waited just a few more weeks to enter the race to succeed (or challenge) her, Mission Local asked.\n\n\"The speaker emerita has not said what she's doing, and there is a race happening. And the filing deadline is in a few months,\" Wiener told the outlet, offering a wan smile.\n\nWiener continued: \"You can always say 'wait a little longer.' That becomes a problem. You have to make a choice. You can always criticize or second-guess. People have told me I made a mistake not getting in three months ago. It's never the right time or it's always the right time.\"\n\n-- Rep. Robert Garcia's knack for driving a disciplined message, earning free media and putting Republicans on the back foot make him a problematic adversary against the GOP majority.

    "title": "Gavin Newsom's gamble on Prop. 50 may be his most calculated yet",
    "body": "SACRAMENTO -- Gov. Gavin Newsom stepped to the microphone at the state Democratic headquarters in mid-August with the conviction of a man certain he was on the right side of history, bluntly saying California has a moral obligation to thwart President Trump's attempt to tilt the balance of Congress.\n\nOver the next 2½ months, Newsom became the public face of Proposition 50, a measure designed to help Democrats win control of the U.S. House of Representatives by temporarily redrawing California's congressional districts.\n\nNewsom took that leap despite tepid support for a gerrymandering measure in early polls.\n\nWith Tuesday's election, the fate of Proposition 50 arrives at a pivotal moment for Newsom, who last week acknowledged publicly that he's weighing a 2028 presidential run. The outcome will test not only his political instincts but also his ability to deliver on a measure that has national attention fixed squarely on him.\n\nFrom the outset, Newsom paired his conviction with caution.\n\n\"I'm mindful of the hard work ahead,\" Newsom said in August, shortly after lawmakers placed Proposition 50 on the ballot.\n\nIt was familiar territory for a governor who has built a career on high-stakes political bets. As San Francisco mayor, his decision to issue same-sex marriage licenses in 2004 made him a progressive icon. It also drew accusations he'd energized conservative turnout that year in the presidential election that ended with George W. Bush winning a second term.\n\nAs the state's newly elected governor, he suspended the death penalty in 2019 despite voters having twice rejected measures to do so, calling it a costly and biased system that \"fails to deliver justice\" -- a move that drew fury from law enforcement groups and victims' families. His decision to take on Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in a 2023 prime-time debate hosted by Sean Hannity on Fox News was intended to showcase his command of policy and political agility, but instead fell flat amid an onslaught of insults.\n\nWith Proposition 50, Newsom placed himself at the center of another potentially career-defining gamble before knowing how it would land. Ahead of Tuesday's special election, polling suggests he may have played his cards right. Six out of 10 likely voters support Proposition 50, according to a survey by UC Berkeley's Institute of Governmental Studies that was co-sponsored by The Times.\n\n\"You know, not everybody would have done it,\" veteran Democratic strategist Gale Kaufman said. \"He saw the risk and he took it.\"\n\nIf approved by voters, the ballot measure would redraw California's congressional maps to favor Democrats beginning with the 2026 midterm elections in hopes of discounting Republican efforts to gerrymander more seats for themselves. California introduced the measure in response to Trump and his political team leaning on Republican-led states to redraw their district lines to help Republicans retain control of the House.\n\nThe balance of power in the closely divided House will determine whether Trump can advance his agenda during his final two years in office -- or face an emboldened Democratic majority that could move to challenge, or even investigate, his administration.\n\nAnd while critics of the governor see a power-craving politician chasing headlines and influence, supporters say this is classic Newsom: confident, risk-tolerant and willing to stand alone when he believes he's right. He faced intense backlash from his political allies when he had conservative personality Charlie Kirk as his inaugural guest on his podcast this year, on which Newsom said he believed it was \"deeply unfair\" for transgender athletes to compete in women's sports. After Kirk was killed, Newsom regularly brought up that interview as a point of pride, noting the backlash he received from his own party over hosting a Trump ally.\n\nIn recent months Newsom struck a deal to stabilize struggling oil refineries, pushed cities to ban homeless encampments and proposed walking back healthcare coverage for undocumented immigrants -- a series of moves that have tested his standing with progressives. Supporters say the moves show his pragmatic streak, while critics argue they reflect a shift to the center ahead of a possible presidential run.\n\n\"In so many ways, he is not a cautious politician,\" said Jessica Levinson, a law professor at Loyola Law School. \"His brand is big, bold decisions.\"\n\nWith Proposition 50, Newsom has cast the redistricting counterpunch as a moral imperative, arguing that Democrat-led states must \"fight fire with fire,\" even if it means pausing a state independent redistricting process largely considered the gold standard. The measure upends a system Californians overwhelmingly endorsed to keep politics out of the map-drawing process.\n\nLevinson said Newsom's profile has been rising along with the polling numbers for Proposition 50 as he has booked national television shows like 'The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\" and appeared in an ad in favor of the ballot measure with former President Obama, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and other prominent Democrats that ran during the World Series.\n\n\"We are talking about Proposition 50 on a nationwide scale,\" Levinson said. \"And it's really hard to talk about Proposition 50 without saying the words 'Gov. Newsom of California spearheading the effort to pass.'\"\n\nCalifornia Republicans have called the effort misguided, arguing that the retaliatory response creates a slippery slope that would erode the independent redistricting process California voters have chosen twice at the ballot box.\n\n\"When you fight fire with fire, the whole world burns,\" said California Rep. Kevin Kiley (R-Rocklin), whose district is among those that would be overhauled under Proposition 50. \"Newsom is trying to claim that Texas did a bad gerrymandering, but what California is doing is a good gerrymander because somehow it's canceling it out ... I just think gerrymandering is wrong. It's wrong in Texas and it's wrong in California.\"\n\nKiley said Newsom never has been one to shy away from national attention \"and for pursing explicitly partisan goals.\"\n\n\"He's certainly used this as an opportunity to do both of those things,\" Kiley said.\n\nOut of the gate, the redistricting plan had lackluster support. Then came the flood of ads by proponents peppered with talking points about Trump rigging the election.\n\nSupporters of Proposition 50 took in more than four times the amount that opponents raised in recent weeks, according to campaign finance reports filed with the state by the three main committees campaigning about the measure. Supporters of Proposition 50 raised so much money that Newsom told them \"you can stop donating.\"\n\nPolitical analysts said the redistricting fight has given Newsom what every ambitious politician craves: a narrative. It's allowed him to cast himself as a defender of democracy while reenergizing donors. That message sharpened when Trump administration officials said they'd monitor polling sites in several California counties at the state GOP's request, prompting Newsom to accuse the Trump administration of \"voter intimidation.\"\n\nRepublican strategist Rob Stutzman said the campaign gave Newsom something he'd struggled to find: \"an authentic confrontation\" with Trump that resonates beyond California.\n\n\"And I think it's worked well for him nationally,\" Stutzman said. \"I think it's been great for him in some ways, regardless of what happens, but if it does lose, it'll hurt the brand that he can win and there will be a lot of disgruntled donors.\"\n\nWhile Newsom has framed the measure as good for the country, Stutzman said it's clear that Proposition 50 has been particularly good for the governor.\n\n\"He's used it for his own purposes very, very effectively,\" Stutzman said. \"If he becomes the [presidential] nominee, you could look back and say this was an important part of him getting there.\"",

    "title": "A Guide to the California Special Election and Prop. 50 Ballot Measure",
    "body": "Kevin Yamamura reported from Sacramento, and Soumya Karlamangla from San Francisco.\n\nMillions of Californians will vote Tuesday in a special election to decide only one question: whether the state should redraw its voting district maps to help Democrats flip as many as five House seats in the 2026 midterms.\n\nThe measure, Proposition 50, came together at a breakneck pace this summer as the brainchild of Gov. Gavin Newsom, House Democrats and state lawmakers. They wanted to counter Republicans in Texas and other states who were gerrymandering maps at the request of President Trump, who has engaged in a national redistricting effort aimed at keeping his party in control of Congress during the second half of his term.\n\nThe California ballot measure asks voters whether the state should suspend its independent process and adopt new congressional districts that are expected to favor Democrats, starting next year.\n\nWith recent polls indicating that the measure was likely to pass, Republicans all but abandoned the airwaves in the last stretch of the campaign. But turnout in California can be difficult to predict, especially in a so-called off-year contest like this one.\n\nHere's what you should know about the election:\n\nHow do I vote?\n\nPolls will be open Tuesday between 7 a.m. and 8 p.m. Pacific time. Voters who arrive by 8 p.m. should stay in line even after polls close because they still have the right to vote.\n\nYou can still mail in your ballot, but you have to make sure that it gets a Tuesday postmark for it to count. For that reason, election officials have advised last-minute voters to head to vote centers or election offices to be certain that their ballots are cast in time. That is particularly the case in rural areas, where changes at the U.S. Postal Service have slowed postmarking.\n\nYou can find your closest polling place through the California Secretary of State website.\n\nAs of Sunday, more than 6 million of California's 23 million voters had already submitted a ballot, according to the California Secretary of State's office.\n\nWhat if I did not receive a ballot?\n\nCalifornia still offers same-day registration, which allows you to use a provisional ballot to vote on Tuesday. You must head to your local elections office or a vote center to use this option.\n\nAfter a provisional ballot is submitted, registrars check to make sure that you are eligible to participate and have not already voted.\n\nWhen will we know the results?\n\nPolls will close at 8 p.m. local time. If the contest is lopsided, the outcome should be known on election night. If the results are close, it could be weeks before the race is called.\n\nWhat's on the ballot?\n\nProposition 50 asks voters whether the state should temporarily approve redrawn House districts for the next three election cycles. The proposed boundaries have been drawn in a way that would most likely lead to more Democrats being elected to Congress.\n\nThe state has 43 Democrats and nine Republicans in the House. Proposition 50 could help Democrats flip as many as five of the Republican-held seats. It could also help Democrats make several swing seats easier to win.\n\nThe ballot measure would restore California's independent redistricting process in 2031, when a commission would draw boundaries based on the 2030 census results and the criteria set forth in the State Constitution.\n\nWho supports the measure?\n\nMr. Newsom and Democratic state lawmakers placed Proposition 50 on the ballot in August to counter gerrymandering efforts in Texas and other states. Texas leaders enacted new maps at the request of Mr. Trump, who wanted to find ways for Republicans to retain control of the House and pass his agenda over the last two years of his term.\n\nMr. Newsom has argued that Democrats needed to respond by gerrymandering their own districts and giving their party a fighting chance in the 2026 midterms. Besides the governor and Democratic state lawmakers, supporters include labor unions, the progressive donor George Soros, House Democrats, former Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Barack Obama.\n\nWho opposes the measure?\n\nRepublicans oppose Proposition 50 and say that the state should retain the boundaries already drawn by its independent commission. Among the most notable opponents are former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a moderate Republican who championed independent redistricting in California; the state's Republican Party; House Republicans; and Kevin McCarthy, a former speaker of the House.\n\nThe opposition campaign received the bulk of its funding from Charles Munger Jr., who is a physicist and a wealthy heir of Charles T. Munger, partner of Warren E. Buffett at Berkshire Hathaway.\n\nThe younger Mr. Munger was a prominent backer of independent redistricting in California when voters installed it in two separate elections in 2008 and 2010.\n\nMr. Schwarzenegger and Mr. Munger have argued for years that voters should not allow politicians to draw their own boundaries or create extreme districts that benefit the party in power. They have made the case that competition in each district is healthy for democracy.\n\nRepublicans have already challenged Proposition 50 in court and have vowed to file more lawsuits if voters approve the measure.\n\nIs it as simple as voting with my party?\n\nMr. Newsom has argued that voting for Proposition 50 is the best way for Californians to stop Mr. Trump. Republicans have made it less about Mr. Trump and focused on calling it a \"power grab\" by California Democrats who want to draw their own district lines.\n\nSome groups have had a difficult time deciding which way to go.\n\nThe state's League of Women Voters branch and California Common Cause, two nonpartisan groups, initially opposed Mr. Newsom's gerrymandering idea because it bucked the principle of independent redistricting. But both groups later went neutral on Proposition 50. Common Cause's national board determined that Mr. Newsom's approach was acceptable because he was countering partisan redistricting in Texas.\n\nMr. Newsom has said that he supports independent redistricting in principle. But he argues that Democrats must fight fire with fire by gerrymandering districts where they can, even if it means suspending California's rules until the next census.\n\nSome California Republicans have said that they oppose mid-decade gerrymandering in all states, including the effort Mr. Trump instigated in Texas. For instance, Representative Kevin Kiley, whose district includes a long stretch of rural Sierra Nevada counties, has proposed legislation in the House that would block mid-decade redistricting across the country. If Proposition 50 were approved, Mr. Kiley would be among the most vulnerable House Republicans.\n\nMid-decade redistricting efforts have gone beyond Texas and California. Other states are pursuing changes that could benefit Republicans in House races, while Democratic-led states generally have a more difficult path to redrawing their boundaries before the midterms.\n\nLaurel Rosenhall contributed reporting from Sacramento.",

    "title": "California voters take up Democrats' push for new congressional maps that could shape House control - The Boston Globe",
    "body": "\"God help us if we lose in California,\" Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom says.\n\nDemocrats need to gain just three seats in the 2026 elections to take control of the House.\n\nHeavily Democratic California and its 52 congressional districts represent by far the Democrats' best opportunity in an unprecedented state-by-state redistricting battle, which started when Texas Republicans heeded Trump's demand that they redraw their boundaries to help the GOP retain its House majority. Democrats hold 43 of the state's seats and hope to boost that to 48.\n\nTrump is fighting not just the Democrats but history. Midterm elections typically punish the party in the White House, but four GOP-led states so far have adopted new district maps to pack more Republican voters into key districts.\n\nCalifornia's Proposition 50 asks voters to suspend House maps drawn by an independent commission and replace them with rejiggered districts adopted by the Democratic-controlled Legislature. Those new districts would be in place for the 2026, 2028 and 2030 elections.\n\nThe recast districts aim to dilute Republican voters' power, in one case by uniting rural, conservative-leaning parts of far northern California with Marin County, a famously liberal coastal stronghold across the Golden Gate Bridge from San Francisco.\n\nThe measure has been spearheaded by Newsom, who has thrown the weight of his political operation behind it in a major test of his mettle ahead of a potential 2028 presidential campaign. Former President Barack Obama has urged voters to pass it as well.\n\nNewsom has sought to nationalize the campaign, depicting the proposal as a counterweight to all things Trump.\n\n\"Republicans want to steal enough seats in Congress to rig the next election and wield unchecked power for two more years,\" Obama says in one ad. \"You can stop Republicans in their tracks.\"\n\nCritics say two wrongs don't make a right. They urge Californians to reject what they call a Democratic power grab, even if they have misgivings about Trump's moves in Republican-led states.\n\nAmong the most prominent critics is Arnold Schwarzenegger, the movie star and former Republican governor who pushed for the creation of the independent commission, which voters approved in 2008 and 2010. It makes no sense to fight Trump by becoming him, Schwarzenegger said in September, arguing that the proposal would \"take the power away from the people.\"\n\nAfter an early burst of TV advertising, opponents of the plan have struggled to raise cash in a state with some of the nation's most expensive media markets. Data compiled by advertising tracker AdImpact last week showed Democrats and other supporters with over $5 million in ad buys booked on broadcast TV, cable and radio. But opponents had virtually no time reserved, though the data didn't include some popular streaming services like Hulu and YouTube or mail advertising.\n\nTotal spending on broadcast and cable ads topped $100 million, with more than two-thirds of it coming from supporters. Newsom told people to stop donating in the race's final weeks.\n\nTrump, who overwhelmingly lost California in his three presidential campaigns, largely stayed out of the fray. A week before the election, he urged voters in a social media post not to vote early or by mail -- messaging that conflicts with that of top Republicans in the state who urged people to get their ballots in as soon as possible.\n\nDemocrats hope to pick up as many as five seats in California if voters approve the new boundaries, offsetting the five that Republicans hope to pick up through their new Texas maps. Republicans also expect to gain one seat each from new maps in Missouri and North Carolina, and potentially two more in Ohio.\n\nCongressional district boundaries are typically redrawn every 10 years to reflect population shifts documented in the census. Mid-decade redistricting is unusual, absent a court order finding fault with the maps in place.\n\nFive other GOP-led states are also considering new maps: Kansas, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana and Nebraska.\n\nOn the Democratic side, Illinois, Maryland, New York and Virginia have proposals to redraw maps, but major hurdles remain.\n\nA court has ordered new boundaries be drawn in Utah, where all four House districts are represented by Republicans, but it remains to be seen if the state will approve a map that makes any of them winnable for Democrats.\n\n___",

    "body": "Richard Ramos is a web producer for CBS Sacramento who was born and raised in Sacramento. He graduated with a BA in Journalism from CSUS.\n\nIt's the final push for California's Proposition 50, a ballot measure backed by Gov. Gavin Newsom and other legislative Democrats that aims to redraw the state's congressional districts.\n\nOn Monday, Gov. Newsom spoke at a rally in San Francisco on the eve of Election Day, rallying supporters.\n\n\"We're going to get out there and win,\" Newsom said, \"and send a powerful message not only to the people of the state of California, but the people all over the United States of America.\"\n\nThe No on 50 campaign is seeking a late surge of support. A recent poll from CBS News shows that approximately 62% of likely voters will vote yes on Proposition 50.\n\nChristian Forte is chair of the Sacramento County Republican Party.\n\n\"You take everything with a grain of salt,\" Forte said. \"Sure, you feel like, 'Oh my God, we're losing,' but you just keep fighting. Donald Trump was supposed to lose in '16.\"\n\nThe two Proposition 50 campaigns have bombarded viewers with political ads. The \"no\" side focused on independent redistricting, while the \"yes\" side focused on President Trump.\n\nRepublican strategist Mike Madrid, who has campaigned against Mr. Trump, said this election has become a referendum on Trump.\n\n\"I don't think that 99% of the voters who voted and have shown up or will show up have looked at the maps,\" Madrid said. \"In many ways, a lot of voters have been waiting since November of 2024 to vote with their middle fingers against Donald Trump, and Prop. 50 is the best way to do it.\"\n\nNewsom and supporters of Proposition 50 said the measure is a counter to congressional redistricting in states like Texas that favors Republicans in next year's midterms. Proposition 50, if approved by voters, would mean that California adopts new legislatively drawn congressional maps that make five GOP-held U.S. House seats in the state more favorable for Democrats in next year's midterm elections.\n\nThe race has quickly become one of the most expensive ballot measures in state history, with more than $253 million raised, as of November 3, across both sides and supporters out-raising opponents by a 2-to-1 margin, according to the California Secretary of State website. The race has also cemented Newsom's status as the leading voice of opposition to Mr. Trump.\n\nAbout a quarter of registered voters have already cast their ballots in early voting as of Monday. That matches early voting totals for the last Governor's race in 2022.",

    "body": "SAN FRANCISCO -- The American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee is challenging a new California law designed to protect Jewish students from discrimination, arguing it is unconstitutionally vague and violates their free speech rights.\n\nThe federal complaint, filed Sunday in San Jose, seeks to invalidate legislation Gov. Gavin Newsom signed last month, creating an Office of Civil Rights to help schools identify and prevent antisemitism. State lawmakers approved the legislation as political tensions have flared in the U.S. over Israel's war in Gaza.\n\nThe new law, which takes effect Jan. 1, does not define antisemitism but gives educators the impression that they could be charged with discrimination \"if they expose their students to ideas, information, and instructional materials that may be considered critical of the State of Israel and the philosophy of Zionism,\" according to the complaint.\n\nJenin Younes, national legal director at the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, says the lack of guidance has a chilling effect on speech among educators.\n\n\"They censor themselves very broadly because they don't know what's going to get them into trouble,\" she said.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed on behalf of individual teachers and students in California public schools, and the Los Angeles Educators for Justice in Palestine.\n\nIn the complaint, middle school science teacher Jonah Olson, says students at his rural, largely Christian school district, often ask him what it means to be Jewish. He responds in part by saying that his Judaism does not include support for the State of Israel, and now he fears that might violate the law.\n\nParents who are part of the lawsuit say they fear their children will be prevented from learning about differing perspectives on Israel, Palestinians and the Middle East.\n\nStudents in public schools nationwide are generally protected against discrimination through state, federal and district policies, but supporters of the law say they needed to do more given a surge in harassment and bullying of Jewish and Israeli students.\n\nThe Anti-Defamation League, which supports the new law, said 860 antisemitic acts such as harassment, vandalism and assault were reported to the group last year at non-Jewish K-12 schools nationwide. The number is a 26% decrease from the previous year but much higher than the 494 reported in 2022.",

    "title": "Douglas Schoen: Newsom's Proposition 50 gamble seemingly pays off",
    "body": "If the polling is correct, California Gov. Gavin Newsom is well on his way to boosting his front-runner status for Democrats' 2028 presidential nomination.\n\nIndeed, after taking a leading role in the campaign to pass Proposition 50 - a ballot measure which would allow California to redraw Congressional districts to give Democrats more seats - it now looks like Newsom's efforts have paid off.\n\nMore than 6-in-10 (62%) California likely voters will vote yes on Prop. 50 according to a recent CBS News poll.\n\nLikewise, a majority (56%) of likely California voters - including a nearly identical 55% of Independents - said they plan to support Prop. 50, versus slightly more than 4-in-10 (43%) who plan to oppose, per Public Policy Institute of California polling.\n\nTo be sure, Prop. 50 was a gamble for Newsom, given the stakes.\n\nWhen he proposed the ballot measure over the summer, ostensibly as a response to GOP redistricting in other states, it was evident that he saw this as a way to raise his profile ahead of a 2028 presidential campaign.\n\nWere Prop. 50 to fail, as I wrote in these pages at the time, Newsom would have appeared ineffective on his home turf, dealing his presidential ambitions a tremendous blow.\n\nMoreover, initial polling from this summer gave Newsom very little room for optimism.\n\nAs Citrin Center polling showed at the time, nearly two-thirds (64%) of California voters - and 61% of California Democrats - preferred keeping California's independent redistricting commission versus 36% who supported giving politicians that power.\n\nIt now appears that Newsom's gamble paid off, and in doing so, answered a question I posed here over one month ago: will Californians' dislike of Donald Trump be enough to push Prop 50 over the finish line?\n\nPolitically astute, Newsom doubled down on that approach - even though Trump has largely avoided this fight - and the data now appears to validate that strategy.\n\nPut another way, Newsom successfully turned a referendum on a blatantly political move into a referendum on Donald Trump, and he wisely did so in a state where anti-Trump feelings permeate deeper than any other state, and he succeeded.\n\nAccording to the aforementioned CBS poll, of the 62% of voters planning to vote yes, three-quarters said their top reason for supporting Prop. 50 was \"to oppose Donald Trump\" while \"opposing national Republicans\" (70%) was the 2nd most common answer.\n\nSimilarly, among the 56% of likely voters who said they'd support Prop 50 in the PPIC poll, there is near unanimous (95%) disapproval of the job President Trump is doing.\n\nTo that end, a TrueDot survey conducted over the summer revealed that, among national Democrats, support for California's redistricting stood at 63% - if the measure was framed as standing up to President Trump and Republicans.\n\nTaken together, Newsom saw an opportunity to nationalize the Prop 50 campaign - with himself and Trump at the center - and appeal to the nearly two-thirds of national Democrats who supported his efforts, hoping that Californians would come around.\n\nAt the same time, nationalizing a state issue allowed Newsom to endear himself to Democratic donors across the country, an invaluable resource when he inevitably launches a campaign.\n\nAccording to a Politico analysis, the governor \"brought in more than 100,000 new-to-Newsom\" donors - people who have not previously donated to any of his campaigns - with more than half coming from outside the state.\n\nThose donors - and the data they already provided - along with the fundraising infrastructure, will also give Newsom a considerable leg up in a Democratic primary.\n\nFurther, while there is no guarantee that those donors stick around through a presidential primary, the number of new donors, along with more than 80% being small-dollar contributors, shows the inroads Newsom has made with grassroots Democrats.\n\nMoreover, even though nothing is official yet, it now appears that Golden State Republicans have thrown in the towel.\n\nAs Politico reported, GOP leaders in the state have essentially shut down the oppose Prop. 50 campaign, and its major donors, such as Charles Munger Jr. have shut their wallets, with Munger's Protect Voters First PAC slashing spending from $4 million per week to less than $300.\n\nWhile Republicans have shut down their campaign, supporters of Prop. 50 remain enthusiastic, and continue hammering away.\n\nThe PAC Reproductive Freedom for All recently rolled out an ad in support of the ballot measure as a way to protect abortion access, and the Yes on 50 PAC even emailed donors to tell them they had enough money and could stop donating.\n\nAs positive as these developments have been for Newsom, particularly vis-à-vis a future Democratic Party, risks still remain. In a general election, Newsom will have to explain to Independents how this - blatantly partisan - move contributes to defending democracy.\n\nUnlike Newsom, the Republican governors who have led their own states' redistricting efforts are not considered presidential contenders, making this issue unique to the California governor.\n\nUltimately however, one has to win a primary before getting to the general election, and should the final Prop. 50 vote resemble recent polls, Newsom will have an advantage that will be difficult for any other Democrat to overcome.\n\nOf course, this far out from the 2028 primaries, anything could happen. But, among the field of Democrats currently considered potential contenders, none will have the same bona fides when it comes to taking on Trump and the GOP.\n\nAs such, it is entirely possible that in 18 months, we will look back on the fight to pass Prop. 50 as the moment Newsom cemented himself as the Democratic nominee for president of the United States.\n\nDouglas Schoen is a longtime Democratic political consultant.",

For years, Newsom viciously demonized America's energy producers and pushed ineffective green policies that caused oil refinery closures and perennially high gasoline and energy prices.\n\nBut even higher gas prices would quickly sink Newsom's presidential campaign, so last month he signed an energy and climate legislation package with the purported goal of increasing oil drilling permits and importing oil, including foreign oil, to increase supply and thus mitigate surging energy costs. His announcement followed Valero's and Phillips 66's forced shuttering of two major California refineries.\n\nYet, the Newsom Administration continues politicized lawfare against the energy industry, claiming that it is solely responsible for the alleged effects of climate change, even as Newsom scrambles to keep it operating in California. California partnered with mass tort plaintiffs' attorneys to sue American energy producers and wrongly accuse them of, among other things, public nuisance, false advertising, and failure to warn. On November 7, the California Superior Court will hear arguments from the defendants on why California's climate suit should be dismissed.\n\nApproximately 60 other states and municipalities - including the cities and counties of San Francisco, Santa Cruz, San Mateo and Oakland - also have sued the energy producers; many of these lawsuits are suspiciously similar, sharing the same claims and plaintiffs' attorney firms. The lawsuits' biggest problem is that climate change issues, particularly those concerning interstate carbon emissions, fall beyond the purview of state courts. The Constitution makes clear that states cannot extend their own laws to provide relief for alleged harms originating from outside their borders, especially where Congress passed an exclusive governing federal law (e.g. the Clean Air Act), to address such public policy issues.\n\nCongress rightfully was concerned that a 50-state patchwork of different laws and standards would interfere with federal policies and cause such legal and regulatory chaos that no industry or company could possibly comply. Additionally, the federal government has exclusive authority to conduct international relations and decide foreign policy.\n\nBecause greenhouse gasses are not static, it is impossible to accurately separate which ones emanated in California versus which ones came from other states or nations such as China and India, who are the world's largest greenhouse-gas emitters and polluters by far, and who consume and burn so much oil that they buy millions of barrels from Russia. Therefore, it is impossible for the courts to accurately allocate purported liability.\n\nAccordingly, federalism principles and our Constitution prohibit state courts from serving as national or international energy regulators. That is why several state courts, including in liberal jurisdictions like Maryland and conservative jurisdictions like South Carolina, have dismissed these cases, holding that these litigations do not belong in state court, but rather in federal court or, even better, in the federal political and legislative arena. The California courts should do the same.\n\nAnother major problem with these lawsuits is that, over the years, certain state courts have improperly allowed left-wing mass tort plaintiffs' attorneys and their local government clients to get away with wrongly twisting and misusing public nuisance law.\n\nPublic nuisance has a narrow legal meaning that doesn't apply to lawful and highly regulated energy production. Originating in 14th-century English common law, it refers to unlawful interference with the public's use of shared land or water, such as blocking access or polluting a public area. Governments can sue to stop the illegal activity and recover cleanup costs from those directly responsible. But as the California Supreme Court noted in People ex rel. Gallo v. Acuna (1997), the illegal conduct must involve misuse of land or water. Moreover, selling lawful products does not constitute a public nuisance and cannot replace proper claims like false advertising or product liability.\n\nAt minimum, California courts must strike this portion of the lawsuit, because if not, one reasonably could see future lawsuits alleging that auto manufacturers or fast-food restaurant chains are liable for billions of dollars in abatement costs for the purported public nuisance of climate change or obesity and its related diseases. That is why the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit long-ago warned in Tioga Public School District v. U.S. Gypsum Company that these public nuisance lawsuits will \"become a monster that would devour in one gulp the entire law of tort\" and must be dismissed.\n\nCalifornia's climate lawsuit, with the growing wave of nearly identical state and municipal suits, proves that warning prescient. If these lawsuits succeed, the collective effect will be tens of billions of dollars seized from the energy industry, further exacerbating California's energy crisis and spreading it across the country. Californians, and Americans for that matter, did not vote for these extreme policies. Legislation through litigation is an abuse of the courts, and California's judges should rightfully put an end to it.",

    "body": "Governor Gavin Newsom will soon almost certainly be celebrating the passage of Proposition 50, a referendum to cast aside the state's \"independent\" congressional map in favor of one drawn by Democrats, for Democrats.\n\nProp 50 is certainly good for Newsom and his party, but it is bad for California. And it highlights the lack of political accountability in the once-Golden State, which suffers some of the worst governance in America.\n\nNewsom sold Prop 50 to the electorate using the same tactics he deployed to survive the 2021 recall vote: he told Democrats that if he lost, President Donald Trump and his supporters would win.\n\nProp 50 actually disenfranchises millions of Californians, but Newsom convinced his party's voters that they would \"defend democracy\" by stripping most Republicans of their seats and helping Democrats retake the U.S. House.\n\nTo that end, Newsom spent more than $250 million of California taxpayers' money -- this in a state that has suffered large budget deficits for two years in a row.\n\n(Republican Assemblyman Carl DeMaio of San Diego correctly predicted the cost -- a pesky habit of his, which is why fellow politicians, mostly Democrats, voted him the \"worst\" legislator in Sacramento. For taxpayers and constituent interests, DeMaio is one of the best.)\n\nPolitical donors spent at least that much money, with Newsom's camp far outspending opponents of Prop 50, even with millions donated by moderate Republican Charles Munger, Jr. (Prop 50 was too far, even for \"RINOs\" like Munger and former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, who is no fan of Trump.)\n\nThat's at least half a billion spent on a special election whose only purpose was to boost national Democratic Party fortunes.\n\nMeanwhile, tens of thousands of residents of fire-ravaged Pacific Palisades, Altadena, and other areas affected by the Los Angeles fires remain displaced.\n\nMany had lost their insurance before the fires -- thanks to Newsom's policies -- and were forced onto the California FAIR (or \"unfair\") plan. Many cannot make up the difference between insurance payouts and the cost of rebuilding. Many may be forced to sell, cheaply.\n\nHalf a billion dollars would help residents rebuild their homes -- homes they lost, in part, due to the negligence of state and local officials, who failed to clear the brush, fill the reservoirs, and deploy the firefighters.\n\nWhen Newsom vetoed SB 236, which would require the state to develop a wildfire mitigation plan, he said it would cost too much -- up to $20 million per year. But he found the money for Prop 50.\n\nThe passage of Prop 50 is a sign that national politics have eclipsed state and local politics. We care more about who is running Washington than what is going on in our own backyards.\n\nAnd the only reason that is possible is that the California media, collectively, have failed to hold Newsom and other elected officials accountable. There is no outlet capable or projecting a statewide voice -- until the California Post. Until now.\n\nProp 50 also represents the personal vanity of one man -- Newsom -- who has placed his presidential ambitions ahead of the state's interests. He has launched outrageous personal attacks on the president, while still begging Congress and the administration to approve $40 billion in additional fire aid.\n\nOf course, Trump is hostile to his political foes, but unlike Newsom, Trump actually gets things done for his voters.\n\nNewsom cannot point to a single major accomplishment in nearly two terms as governor. He seems to think his primary responsibility is trolling Republicans in other states.\n\nHe has failed to build high-speed rail; his electric vehicle mandate was done in by weak sales before Trump took office; his billions in spending on homelessness has made the problem worse. California also leads the nation in poverty and unemployment.\n\nProp 50 represents Newsom's gamble that Democratic Party primary voters care more about a candidate who fights Trump than a candidate who achieves results.\n\nOne can, in theory, do both: look at San Francisco mayor Daniel Lurie, who convinced Trump to cancel a \"surge\" of federal law enforcement to the city. Lurie didn't call Trump names, or attack him directly. He opposed Trump's policy, but spoke to him personally.\n\nThat is how principled opposition is meant to be practiced. Newsom has abandoned that approach for a caricature of what Democrats believe Trump to be: mean, selfish, and dishonest.\n\nIt takes a special kind of duplicity to claim that \"saving democracy\" means eliminating the opposition party's ability to compete fairly for representation, or to override the voters' own past verdict in favor of independent redistricting.\n\nNewsom claims he is not canceling the independent commission, but merely setting it aside until the next Census -- or elevating it, pushing for some kind of national independent redistricting commission.\n\nThat is perhaps the biggest lie of all, because he knows he is lying: such a commission would be unconstitutional, since district boundaries are reserved for states. It also has no chance of being accepted by either party.\n\nNewsom's lies are rarely challenged because he avoids opposition media; like the hapless former Rep. Katie Porter, who leads Democrats vying to replace him, he is used to obsequious deference from the press.\n\nProp 50 shows that democracy is in danger in California -- and it is in danger because it has, until now, lacked accountability. This is a low point for the state. But with the California Post, the turnaround begins.",

    "body": "SACRAMENTO -- While President Trump was pushing National Guard troops from city to city like some little kid playing with his toy soldiers, California Gov. Gavin Newsom was coaxing voters into fighting the man's election-rigging scheme.\n\nIt turned out to be an easy sell for the governor. By the end, Californians appeared ready to send a loud message that they not only objected to the president's election rigging but practically all his policies.\n\nTrump is his own worst enemy, at least in this solidly blue state -- and arguably the California GOP's biggest current obstacle to regaining relevancy.\n\nHere's a guy bucking for the Nobel Peace Prize who suggests that the country resume nuclear weapons testing -- a relic of the Cold War -- and sends armed troops into Portland and Chicago for no good reason.\n\nThe commander in chief bizarrely authorized Marines to fire artillery shells from a howitzer across busy Interstate 5. Fortunately, the governor shut down the freeway. Or else exploding shrapnel could have splattered heads in some topless convertible. As it was, metal chunks landed only on a California Highway Patrol car and a CHP motorcycle. No injuries, but the president and his forces came across as blatantly reckless.\n\nAnd while Trump focused on demolishing the First Lady's historic East Wing of the White House and hitting up billionaire grovelers to pay for a monstrous, senseless $300-million ballroom -- portraying the image of a spoiled, self-indulgent monarch -- Newsom worked on a much different project. He concentrated on building a high-powered coalition and raising well over $100 million to thwart the president with Proposition 50.\n\nThe ballot measure was Newsom's and California Democrats' response to Trump browbeating Texas and other red states to gerrymander congressional districts to make them more Republican-friendly. The president is desperate to retain GOP control of the House of Representatives after next year's midterm elections.\n\nNewsom retaliated with Prop. 50, aimed at flipping five California House seats from Republican to Democrat, neutralizing Texas' gerrymandering.\n\nIt's all sleazy, but Trump started it. California's Democratic voters, who greatly outnumber Republicans, indicated in preelection polling that they preferred sleazy redistricting to an unhinged president continuing to reign roughshod over a cowardly, subservient Congress.\n\nA poll released last week by the UC Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies found that 93% of likely Democratic voters supported Prop. 50. So did 57% of independents. Conversely, symbolic of Trump's hold on the GOP and our political polarization, 91% of Republicans opposed the measure.\n\nSimilar partisan voting was found in a survey by the Public Policy Institute of California. Pollster Mark Baldassare said that \"96% of the people voting yes on 50 disapprove of Trump.\"\n\nDemocrats -- 94% of them -- also emphatically disapproved of the Trump administration's immigration raids, the PPIC poll showed. Likewise, 67% of independents. But 84% of Republicans backed how the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency was rounding up people living here illegally.\n\nICE agents shrouded in masks and not wearing identification badges while traveling in unmarked vehicles -- raiding hospitals, harassing school kids and chasing farmworkers -- are not embraced in diverse, immigrant-accepting California.\n\nWhen the PPIC poll asked voters how undocumented immigrants should be handled, 69% -- including 93% of Democrats -- chose this response: \"There should be a way for them to stay in the country legally.\" But 67% of Republicans said they should be booted.\n\nThe ICE raids were among the Trump actions -- and flubs -- that helped generate strong support for Prop. 50. It was the voters' device for sticking it to the president.\n\n\"Californians are concerned about the overreach of the federal government and that helped 50,\" Democratic consultant Roger Salazar says. \"It highlights how much the Trump administration has pushed the envelope. And a yes vote on Prop. 50 was a response to that.\"\n\nJonathan Paik, director of a Million Votes Project coalition that contacted 2 million people promoting Prop. 50, says: \"We heard very consistently from voters that they were concerned about the impact of Trump's ICE raids and the rising cost of living. These raids don't just target immigrants, they destabilize entire communities and deepen economic struggles.\n\n\"Voters saw Prop. 50 as a way to restore balance and protect their families' ability to work, pay rent and live safely.\"\n\nThe measure also provided a platform for Democratic U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla of California to explore possibly joining a crowded field of candidates running for governor. Newsom is termed-out after next year.\n\nThe Trump administration did Padilla a gigantic favor in June by roughing up the senator and handcuffing him on the floor when he tried to query Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem during a Los Angeles news conference about ICE raids. Such publicity for a politician is golden.\n\nPadilla became a leading advocate for Prop. 50 while seriously considering a gubernatorial bid. The senator said he'd decide after Tuesday's special election.\n\n\"I haven't made any decision,\" he told me last week. \"Sometime in the next several weeks.\"\n\nBut it's tempting for this L.A. native, the son of Mexican immigrants who was inspired to enter politics by anti-immigrant bashing in the 1990s.\n\n\"I'd have an opportunity and responsibility to be a leading voice against that,\" he said. \"California can be a leader for the rest of the country on immigration, environmental protection, reproduction quality, healthcare...\"\n\nIn many ways it already is. But Trump hates that. And California Republicans step in it by meekly following the hugely unpopular president. Prop. 50 is the latest result.\n\nCalifornia Republicans can do better than behave like Trump's wannabe reserve toy soldiers.",

    "body": "APEX GOVERNOR -- Gavin Newsom could have been humiliated had his gerrymandering campaign gone differently. Instead, he's rocketing toward the 2028 primary with the wind at his back.\n\nPolling suggests Proposition 50 will pass comfortably on Tuesday -- delivering the governor a victory on the national stage and saving him from the sort of agonizing near-loss he endured during his last signature ballot measure campaign.\n\nMore than that, his team parlayed the campaign into an explosion of new, small-dollar donors outside California who could supercharge his expected presidential campaign. Newsom's political machine got yet another practice run ahead of 2028. And millions of dollars worth of ads featuring Newsom standing up to President Donald Trump flooded the zone in California for weeks.\n\nEven the state's precarious budget situation -- the kind of thing that could hobble a sitting governor in a presidential campaign -- has improved markedly in recent months.\n\nWhich brings Newsom to an apex in his political life.\n\nNever before has he been such a focal point of the national Trump resistance. He broke free from a short-lived detente with the president earlier this year with widely-viewed social media trolling, a spin through the early primary state of South Carolina and continuous sparring with Trump over his deployment of troops to California streets.\n\nThe likely redistricting win would be icing on the cake, not only winning the governor attention but stacking an anti-MAGA achievement onto his resume that could serve as valuable campaign fodder in a sprawling Democratic field.\n\nEarly polling on (and modeling of) the Democratic primary has shown the political benefits of Newsom's blend of bombast and action against the president. Most surveys place Newsom at or near the top of the potential field, even if a recent poll of New Hampshire voters had him trailing former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg in that early primary state.\n\nBut, but, but ... It's extremely early. The field is far from set. Newsom will have to navigate more fractious policy fights between core constituencies during his last year governing California, if his first seven are any indication. And once term limits do force him out nearly two years before the general election, he'll lose the news-making platform of the governor's office.\n\nEven on Tuesday night, he will be sharing the spotlight. Across the country, Zohran Mamdani, the front-runner in New York's mayoral election, is galvanizing the left flank of Newsom's party. But it's Newsom, not Mamdani, rising on 2028 shortlists. And if Prop 50 passes, as expected, Newsom will be poised to continue his ascent.\n\nRELATED: \"Newsom tells Americans to 'wake up' ahead of critical elections\" by Cheyanne M.

Headlining final Prop 50 rallies, including one in the Bay Area.\n\nTEAM PROP 50 -- The coterie of advisers guiding Prop 50 has been in the trenches with the California governor for years. Several are likely to fold into a broader presidential campaign apparatus if Newsom runs in 2028 -- as he's widely expected to do -- bringing a deep knowledge of his strengths and vulnerabilities cultivated over the course of his rise. And they'll be informed by this deeply partisan campaign that has functioned as a proxy battle over America's trajectory.\n\nJeremy B. White and Melanie Mason compiled this guide to Newsom's once (and likely future) political team.\n\nHASTA LA VISTA -- To those hoping to defeat Prop 50, former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger is the would-be star player who stayed off the field. California's most popular Republican -- and the last to have any real relevance in state politics -- did little to convince voters that the proposed gerrymander would subvert core tenets of representational democracy, as he's warned.\n\nAs Will McCarthy reports, Schwarzenegger spent a key stretch this fall cavorting across Europe, leading a life that one adviser likened to that of \"a real-life Forrest Gump.\" He skipped the opportunity to barnstorm the state in opposition to Prop 50. Opponents of the measure aren't hiding their frustration with the former governor who's returned to the life of a Hollywood celebrity.\n\n\"I'm very fond of Arnold Schwarzenegger,\" said Charles Munger Jr., a longtime Republican donor who has given $30 million to an anti-Prop 50 campaign on which the former governor has refused to play a starring role. \"But he's both brilliant and exasperating.\"\n\nWHERE WERE THE MEGADONORS? -- Newsom's last two campaigns featured a star-studded roster of celebrity and Silicon Valley donors, from Steven Spielberg to Ron Conway and Priscilla Chan. But most of the California governor's past top donors -- at least 54 of them -- have not reopened their checkbooks for Tuesday's ballot measure that would redraw California House districts to favor Democrats, a POLITICO analysis found.\n\nAs Christine Mui reports, of the more than 30 billionaires who once bankrolled Newsom's campaigns, only seven of them, including George Soros, put money behind the redistricting push.\n\nThe no-shows reflect a rare point of potential weakness for Newsom in a redistricting campaign that has otherwise gone entirely his way -- polls suggest the measure is likely to pass, and Newsom has used it to build an army of small-dollar donors. But big-dollar donors carry weight in presidential campaigns, too, and some view these withdrawals as a warning sign for Newsom's 2028 prospects.\n\nWARNING SIREN -- Newsom had a sharp message for Americans gearing up to hit the polls in several states Tuesday: \"Wake up.\" The governor told NBC that the Trump administration's threats to implement \"strike teams\" across U.S. cities should motivate people to turnout at the polls for special elections in California, Virginia and New Jersey, as Cheyanne M. Daniels reports.\n\n\"What the hell do we need to tell people to get them off their couch, to say, \"Well, hold on, I may have liked his bluster, I may not have liked the last guy, but I didn't sign up for this?'\" Newsom told Kristen Welker on Sunday's \"Meet the Press.\"\n\nAccording to a Washington Post report of a leaked memo, the National Guard is creating a \"quick reaction force\" of thousands of troops to be trained in crowd control and civil disturbance, ready to deploy to U.S. cities by early 2026.\n\nFIRST IN PLAYBOOK: GOLDEN WEEK -- Brian Goldsmith, a Democrat running for the state Senate, has won the endorsement of former Speaker Nancy Pelosi. She said Goldsmith, a media consultant and former journalist, \"is a reminder of the power of new ideas in our politics\" and that \"as an adviser to Democrats, Brian knows how to fight for our values and knows how to win.\"\n\nGoldsmith said former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg is also endorsing him and will headline a fundraiser in Los Angeles this Wednesday. Goldsmith is running in a crowded field of candidates vying for the open Senate seat in District 24 (Hollywood Hills, Santa Monica, Malibu). The district's current senator, Ben Allen, completes his final term next year.\n\nIN THE SPOTLIGHT -- Lauren Sanchez, Newsom's top climate adviser, has largely been behind the scenes as she helped craft his climate agenda the last four years -- but now she's the public face of the state's powerful air quality agency. Read Friday's California Climate to see the challenges ahead for Sanchez and a reflection on her time advising Newsom.\n\nLAWYER UP -- Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas has opened a legal defense fund to combat a fired ex-staffer's lawsuit alleging wrongdoing by the speaker and his brother Rick (which they have vigorously denied, seeking to have the suit dismissed). While it's not uncommon for lawmakers to raise money to fight court claims -- multiple incumbents are doing so -- it's a little more complicated for Rivas, whose job entails a good deal of collecting cash for frontline Assembly races.\n\nGOP REDISTRICTING WIN -- Ohio's bipartisan redistricting commission approved a new congressional map Friday, giving Republicans a measured win in the national redistricting battle. The map, passed unanimously by the commission, gives the GOP a better opportunity to flip two seats, as Jacob Wendler reports.\n\nThe congressional delegation is currently split between 10 Republicans and five Democrats. A best-case scenario for Republicans would likely result in a 12-3 breakdown. Republicans in Ohio opted to reach the agreement with commission Democrats instead of going through the GOP-controlled Legislature. Should a map have been passed by lawmakers, which likely would have resulted in a 13-2 map, a potential ballot referendum could have blocked it for 2026.\n\n-- Thousands of people showed up at food banks in Southern California over the weekend as federal food assistance benefits lapsed. (Los Angeles Times)\n\n-- San Francisco's chief economist says the city's upzoning plan will create far fewer new homes than previously estimated. (San Francisco Chronicle)\n\n-- Months after San Diego ramped up enforcement of its ordinance banning overnight RV parking, many homeless people are drowning in tickets. (The San Diego Union-Tribune)\n\n-- A man detained at ICE's largest facility in California alleges he was denied medical care after he fell from a bunk bed and sustained a head injury.

Many of them worked for his gubernatorial campaigns or helped him stave off a recall attempt in 2021.\n\nSeveral are likely to fold into a broader presidential campaign apparatus if Newsom runs in 2028, as he's widely expected to do, bringing a deep knowledge of his strengths and vulnerabilities cultivated over the course of his rise.

    "title": "Gavin's big gamble: The California governor's redistricting battle with Trump sets up 2028",
    "body": "Gov. Gavin Newsom warned that the US may not see a presidential election in 2028, describing authoritarian actions by the Trump administration.\n\nGavin Newsom's 2028 presidential ambitions are about to get a self-imposed stress test after months of putting his political muscle behind one of the Democratic Party's more daring campaigns of 2025.\n\nCalifornia voters are set decide on a Nov. 4 ballot initiative that would radically change how the Golden State's congressional boundaries are drawn.\n\nNewsom is responsible for this rare off-cycle political campaign, setting it up as a heavyweight counterpunch to President Donald Trump, who has arm-twisted Republican-led legislatures from Texas to Indiana to Missouri to redo their own maps ahead of next year's all-important midterms.\n\nMuch more than Democrats potentially winning back control of the U.S. House of Representatives is at stake for the 58-year-old Newsom. The second-term governor has been busy this year trying to distinguish himself from other White House hopefuls with a media blitz and punchy-style online that has mimicked the MAGA leader while standing up against the Trump administration at almost every turn.\n\n\"The meaning of a win in California is huge for Democrats in 2026, and obviously it's a monumental political win for the governor,\" Sean Clegg, a senior Newsom strategist, told USA TODAY in an interview.\n\nNewsom could use the boost as he traverses through a shadow presidential primary that so far lacks a clear favorite on the road to the White House but features prominent figures such as fellow Californian Kamala Harris, the former vice president who is largely absent from the 2025 campaign trail while selling a memoir about her 2024 loss to Trump.\n\nIt's why he is betting that voters will accept Proposition 50, which would allow the state legislature to redo California's 52 congressional districts through 2030 and create as many as five more seats favorable to Democrats before the November 2026 election.\n\nNewsom is spending a significant amount of his political stock to galvanize Democrats, including former President Barack Obama and his likely 2028 rivals, into breaking a long-held orthodoxy against meddling with congressional maps. If successful, Proposition 50 would ditch a nonpartisan commission California voters established via a 2010 ballot initiative that draws those district boundaries.\n\nFor Newsom, it's a move that he believes must be done. While a firm supporter of the independent commission, he and other Democrats cannot wait and hope for the best, according to a confidant close to Newsom who requested anonymity in order to speak freely.\n\nIn interviews, Newsom has talked about his ballot initiative efforts by putting the spotlight on what success this year means: Making next November's midterms a clear referendum for voters as the \"de facto\" end of Trump's presidency.\n\n\"I can't take what's going on. I mean, no bull----. I can't take it,\" Newsom said in an Oct. 25 appearance on the \"All the Smoke\" podcast, hosted by former NBA players Matt Barnes and Stephen Jackson. He added: \"Every single day, every single hour and it's not even about Dems versus Republicans, it's about this country and what we stand for. They're literally putting America in reverse.\"\n\nProposition 50 carries Newsom' 2028 aspirations\n\nNewsom's efforts come with big risks.\n\nThe ballot initiative he's pushing is costing taxpayers a whopping $282.6 million, according to state agencies. If the governor fails or crosses the finish line with lackluster margins, California political experts warn it will drive home many of the negatives attacks rung by opponents that argue Newsom alienates more swing voters than he attracts.\n\n\"If the results are close, that doesn't play well for Gavin Newsom either,\" said Brian Sobel, a longtime political analyst based in the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\n\"Even a low double-digit win, I think that's going to reflect poorly,\" Sobel added. \"But if it's a runaway win, yeah, that's another feather in his cap.\"\n\nMore than the other fall campaigns in Virginia, New Jersey or New York City - all places where Trump also looms - Proposition 50 is an early showcase of one specific Democratic 2028 contender's influence. By all accounts, Newsom appears on the verge of a double-digit victory.\n\nAn Emerson College poll released Oct. 24 showed 57% of likely California voters back Proposition 50 versus 37% who oppose it. An additional 6% remain undecided.\n\nCongressional maps aren't the only place where Newsom has done battle with Trump. The governor has used his megaphone and authority running California to insert himself - and his imminent presidential bid - in almost every debate about the second-term Republican president, filling a void that contrasts with Democrats' being out of power in Washington.\n\nNewsom has filed suits over the president threatening to send National Guard troops into California; combated the administration on imposing foreign tariffs; established climate partnerships at a time when Trump is leaving them; highlighted civil rights; funded reproductive rights; and supplemented food banks amid the ongoing government shutdown.\n\nNewsom's profile has been rising for years. He was included on the short list of presidential candidates in 2022 when Democrats started airing concerns about then-President Joe Biden's ability to run for a second term. At the time, the California governor balked at suggestions he should directly challenge the incumbent president in a primary and instead played a Biden surrogate.\n\nBut when he jousted during a FOX News debate with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who was running for president on the GOP primary side, political observers suggested the pair were who voters really wanted to choose from in 2024.\n\n\"Honestly the country would be incredibly better off if this was our choice,\" Benjamin Domenech, a conservative commentator, said in an October 2023 post on X.\n\nFast forward to 2025 and Newsom's upcoming ballot initiative will be closely watched as a show of his political might much in the same way other would-be contenders, such as Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, who faces a 2026 reelection race that he'll need to win in order to have a chance at 2028.\n\nBesides Obama, who has starred in an ad urging a 'yes' vote on the measure, Newsom is bringing other key figures into the fight. He successfully recruited former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, in addition to Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, of New York, and Sen. Chris Murphy, of Connecticut. Both Ocasio-Cortez and Murphy are seen as possible 2028 Democratic candidates for president.\n\n\"I think every single state that's run by Democrats should be using every amount of leverage they have to play the same game that Republicans are,\" Murphy told USA TODAY. \"We didn't start this, but we can't unilaterally disarm.\"\n\nSources close to Newsom said the governor's push to take the redistricting battle beyond California underscores his ability to bring different factions together. It also helps that other Democrats are following his lead, as more GOP-led states try to redraw their own maps at Trump's urging ahead of the 2026 midterms.\n\nThe Virginia legislature convened this month and passed a measure along partisan lines to redraw its congressional maps via a constitutional amendment that aims to create two or three additional Democratic-held seats. In Illinois, Gov. JB Pritzker, another potential 2028 White House contender, told reporters on Oct. 27 he's having conversations about changing the state's congressional map with legislators.\n\n\"Oh sure, I think it's possible,\" Pritzker said. \"This is all about the fact that Donald Trump is now trying to, well, rig the game.\"\n\nMaryland Gov. Wes Moore, another possible 2028 presidential contender, compared the national fight over congressional district maps to \"political redlining\" and was eager to join the fray. But those plans have been thwarted by one of their own. Democrat Bill Ferguson, the Maryland state Senate president, is against the idea, according to reports.\n\nNaysayers on both sides attack, question Newsom's effectiveness\n\nNewsom's White House ambitions remain just that, for now.\n\nBut the fact he's eyeing a campaign announcement soon after the 2026 midterms results, according to CBS News, sets him up as an architect of the Democratic comeback should his efforts in California help bloom a House majority for his party one year from now.\n\nThe governor's critics are using the costly ballot initiative to poke holes in his growing aura as detractors argue it represents a naked self-centered effort that is more about Newsom's presidential ambitions than protecting democracy.\n\nJessica Millan Patterson, a former California Republican Party chair who leads a \"No on Prop 50\" group backed by the U.S. House GOP, said the state's redistricting panel is popular and should be credited with creating diverse delegations in Sacramento, the state's capital, and Washington.\n\nVoters approved the commission to protect themselves from politicians selecting their own constituents, she said, and they are leaning into that message now with an eye on Democrats, people who have no party preference and also GOP-aligned ones.\n\n\"So to say that this is a power grab, I think, is kind of an understatement,\" Millan Patterson said. \"It is nothing more than a stepping stone for Gavin Newsom to run for president.\"\n\nThis has been an uphill battle for opponents, however, as state data shows the campaign against Proposition 50 has raked in roughly $78 million. Groups supporting the cause have raised $127.5 million.\n\nNewsom holds an overall positive job approval from California voters, according to a CBS News/YouGov poll released in October. It found 53% of approve of his job performance versus 47% who disapprove.\n\nOpposing the governor is a leading reason for Proposition 50 opponents to show up, the survey shows, with 51% saying Newsom is why they're against the initiative.\n\nNewsome's skeptics also include the activist left who aren't sold on him becoming the Democratic face of the party in 2026 and beyond, even as they support combating Trump and the GOP's redistricting efforts.\n\nAdam Green, cofounder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, an influential left-leaning group, said Newsom has not set himself apart as someone average Americans think of as the authentic messenger who connects with a more positive vision for working people.\n\n\"We're living in an outsider moment,\" Green said. \"Today's politics are not about left versus right. They're more accurately about outsider rage versus creatures of the inside.\"\n\nAs much as many Democrats enjoy brawling with Trump, changing congressional maps like Newsom now advocates in the middle of a decade - rather than at a decade's start once new U.S. census data is compiled - does create uneasiness inside the party.\n\nIndependent commissions take the process out of the hands of elected officials, said Sen. Andy Kim, D-New Jersey, who emphasized that he strongly believes in voters choosing who represents them.\n\n\"I don't like any of this, honestly,\" he said.\n\nBut Kim added that he thinks Trump and his GOP allies can't get away with \"blatant cheating\" to keep a majority in Congress.\n\nKentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, who has been making similar pre-2028 presidential pit stops in early states, TV interviews and podcasts, \"wishes Republicans hadn't moved forward with their cynical ploy in Texas,\" a spokesman told USA TODAY.\n\nBeshear acknowledges, however, both parties have to play by the same rules and supports Proposition 50, the spokesman said.\n\nSen. Ruben Gallego, D-Arizona, another rumored 2028 contender, said he has no idea if Proposition 50 prevailing would help out Newsom's presidential efforts. But he said he agreed that Democratic-led states must take action.\n\n\"More importantly, it's going to stop the Republicans from trying to get a permanent majority in this country,\" Gallego told USA TODAY in an interview. \"Again, I wish we could pass anti-gerrymandering legislation, but until then I don't believe in unilateral disarmament.\"\n\nNewsom's office has been working to quell these concerns by spotlighting that a provision under Proposition 50 would return California to a citizen-led redistricting commission process after the 2030 census. They are emphasizing that his political aims include reinvigorating Democrats by building confidence, focusing on local and state elections and developing a clear national message.\n\nBut Newsom himself isn't being shy about those ambitions. One day after Harris teased that she is \"not done\" with public life in an Oct. 25 BBC interview, Newsom yanked the spotlight back, telling \"CBS News Sunday Morning\" during an interview about his many points of opposition to Trump that he'd be \"lying otherwise\" if he didn't admit running for president was on his mind.\n\nContributing: Zachary Schermele, Sarah D.

    "title": "California law seeking to shield Jewish students from antisemitism challenged on free speech grounds",
    "body": "The American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee is challenging a new California law designed to protect Jewish students from discrimination that plaintiff teachers and students say is unconstitutionally vague and violates their free speech rights.\n\nThe federal complaint, filed Sunday in San Jose, seeks to invalidate legislation Gov. Gavin Newsom signed last month creating an Office of Civil Rights to help schools identify and prevent antisemitism. State lawmakers approved the legislation as political tensions have flared in the U.S. over Israel's war in Gaza.\n\nThe new law, which takes effect Jan. 1, doesn't define antisemitism but gives educators the impression that they could be charged with discrimination \"if they expose their students to ideas, information, and instructional materials that may be considered critical of the State of Israel and the philosophy of Zionism,\" according to the complaint.\n\nJenin Younes, national legal director of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, says the lack of guidance has a chilling effect on speech among educators.\n\n\"They censor themselves very broadly because they don't know what's going to get them into trouble,\" she said.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed on behalf of individual teachers and students in California public schools and the Los Angeles Educators for Justice in Palestine.\n\nIn the complaint, middle school science teacher Jonah Olson says students in his rural, largely Christian school district often ask him what it means to be Jewish. He responds in part by saying that his Judaism does not include support for the State of Israel, and now he fears that might violate the law.\n\nParents who are part of the lawsuit say they fear their children will be prevented from learning about differing perspectives on Israel, Palestine and the Middle East.\n\nStudents in public schools nationwide are generally protected against discrimination through state, federal and district policies, but supporters of the law say they needed to do more given a surge in harassment and bullying of Jewish and Israeli students.\n\nThe Anti-Defamation League, which supports the new law, said 860 antisemitic acts such as harassment, vandalism and assault were reported to the group last year at non-Jewish K-12 schools nationwide. The number is a 26% decrease from the previous year but much higher than the 494 reported in 2022.",

    "title": "What to know about California's Proposition 50  --  Gavin Newsom's...",
    "body": "That will be the question facing Californians on Tuesday in a special election that could reshape the balance of power in the state and the country for years to come.\n\nProposition 50, backed by Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom, would temporarily redraw the state's electoral maps in a way that could help Democrats flip five Congressional seats in the 2026 midterms.\n\nThe new maps were hastily hashed out in August in response to a similar redistricting scheme in Texas designed to hand more seats to the Republicans. It's a fight-fire-with-fire strategy meant to balance the scales in Washington.\n\nAs it currently stands, a bipartisan commission is in charge of California's maps, not the state's Democratic legislature. Prop 50 would give the legislature power to impose its own electoral maps for the 2026, 2028, and 2030 elections.\n\nNewsom and his supporters are pretty transparent about their motives. The ballot item clearly states that Prop 50 \"authorizes temporary changes to congressional district maps in response to Texas' partisan redistricting.\"\n\nThe question is whether left-leaning Californians are willing to try and out-gerrymander the gerrymanderers.\n\nProp 50 is a smoking hot item in California politics right now, with supporters and detractors bombarding voters with TV ads, billboards, and leaflets stuffed in their mailboxes.\n\nAn initial controversy surrounded whether to hold the special election at all, which Republicans in the State Assembly estimated would cost an already cash-strapped California more than $200 million.\n\nAs for Prop 50 itself: California voters typically despise gerrymandering. They voted to establish the independent body -- the California Citizens Redistricting Commission (CRC) -- that draws electoral maps in the late 00s amid a frenzy of anti-gerrymandering sentiment.\n\nNow many of those same voters feel they're being offered a deal with the Devil.\n\nProponents describe Prop 50 as a referendum on Trump's dominion over Congress.\n\nTexas' redistricting bill -- drawn up at Trump's request and passed in August -- was designed to add at least five House seats to Republicans, which could dash Democrats' hopes of taking back the House.\n\nAs for the ethics of it: Turnabouts is fair play, supporters say, and it isn't like they're being sneaky about their motives. In fact, Newsom has gone so far as to call Prop 50 \"the most transparent and democratic redistricting that's ever been done in the United States of America.\"\n\nBut beating Republicans at their own game could undermine the independent redistricting system Californians fought for.\n\nDetractors include former governor Arnold Swartzenegger, who presided over the formation of the CRC. He condemned Democrats' effort to \"out-cheat\" their opponents in an interview with CNN.\n\nVery high.\n\nFifty-six percent of likely voters said they would vote \"yes\" on Prop 50, in a survey conducted earlier this month by the University of California Berkeley. Forty-three percent said they would vote \"no,\" with 1 percent undecided.\n\nAnother survey by the Emerson College Polling Center had a nearly identical result, and another poll by CBS News put support for Prop 50 at 62%.\n\nIn the CBS poll, an overwhelming number of Prop 50 supporters said they were voting \"yes\" specifically to oppose the Trump Administration and national Republicans.\n\nThe new electoral map prunes out conservative-leaning districts in the north and far south of the state, leaving a three-district Republican stronghold in the southeast, along the Nevada border.\n\nWhether the new map unfairly divides communities and demographics depends on whom you ask, with both sides arguing that theirs is the fairest.\n\nA statement from the Vote NO on Prop 50 campaign claims the new map splinters \"many Latino, Asian and Black communities who fought to stay unified in the same district,\" but an analysis by the Public Policy Institute of California found that both maps are more or less the same when it comes to preserving minority power bases.\n\nAs previously mentioned, former Governor Schwarzenegger wants to terminate the measure, calling it a tragic step backwards for the independent redistricting movement his state helped pioneer.\n\nFormer President Barack Obama endorsed Prop 50 at a virtual event with Gavin Newsom.\n\n\"There is a broader principle at stake that has to do with whether or not our democracy can be manipulated by those who are already in power,\" Obama said in a quote reported by the Washington Post.\n\nOther supporters include Representatives Nancy Pelosi and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and senators Alex Padilla and Adam Schiff.\n\nBut seven of the 15 members of the CRC itself oppose Orop 50, according to local KCRA 3, including the Committee's leader Neal Fornaciari.",

    "title": "Newsom dabbles in honesty about his presidential ambitions",
    "body": "Like George Washington, Gavin Newsom cannot tell a lie.\n\nTechnically, historians think Washington never actually said that and Newsom says things that aren't true all the time, but Newsom is dying to follow Washington's footsteps to the presidency and he's finally being somewhat honest about it.\n\nWhen asked the other day if he was considering running, California's governor told CBS News: \"Yeah, I'd be lying otherwise. I'd just be lying. And I'm not -- I can't do that.\"\n\nIt appears Newsom means he doesn't want to lie going forward, because in the past he's repeatedly denied it even though becoming president is all he seems to think about.\n\nDreaming of higher office is so on brand for Newsom. As San Francisco mayor Newsom dreamed of being governor, and when those hopes were temporarily derailed by Jerry Brown, Newsom became Lieutenant Governor. As lieutenant governor he never stopped dreaming and upon becoming California's governor he lived every day as if he were campaigning for the presidency.\n\nAnd now he's finally being honest about it.\n\nIn 2022, Newsom told the San Francisco Chronicle's Editorial Board that he had \"sub-zero\" interest in running for president.\n\n\"It's not even on my radar,\" Newsom said.\n\nNot on his radar, though he would only talk to national media for the longest time. He wouldn't answer questions on California issues to California media but he would sit down with The Atlantic and New York Times and get poetic about vague concepts like democracy.\n\nNevermind the fact that he has launched several podcasts in an effort to expand his reach beyond California. Nevermind the fact that he has consistently tried positioning himself as the leader of the Democratic Party. Newsom saw in polling that Democrats want a fighter and he can tell you all the ways he has fought with President Donald Trump, Florida Gov. Ron Desantis, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, Fox News and so on.\n\nIf you're on the right, Newsom will fight with you. Unless he'd rather use you for clout chasing, then he'll tell you all about how he gets is, which he says constantly (\"I get it\"), like in his conversations with the late Charlie Kirk, or Fox News' Sean Hannity, or far-right Steve Bannon, or podcast host Shawn Ryan.\n\nNewsom is a fighter, but also he gets it. He knows what it's like to be you, whoever you are, and he'll tell you all about it if you let him, especially if you're a member of the National Press Club or a voter in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina or Nevada.\n\nNewsom is so thirsty for national attention and is willing to do anything to be president - everything except govern effectively. The same problems plaguing California now are the same problems plaguing California when he was elected: Cost of living, homelessness, housing shortage, education crisis, literacy crisis, energy crisis, wildfire crises, water crisis, and so on. All the crises.\n\nAnyone who has ever looked for a new job while working at their current job has probably experienced a bad case of divided attention. You come in to work in a coat and tie even though it's not a coat and tie kind of job because you have an interview later in the day. You make up a plausible excuse and offer it to coworkers before they even ask.\n\nThat's the past six years under Newsom as governor, except Californians ask. We ask constantly \"Hey, where are you going governor? You got a job interview?\" \"No,\" has always replied, he has \"sub zero interest\" in a new job. But then he's not in the office and the work's not getting done and he pops up in a fancy restaurant after he ordered the state shut down or somewhere on the east coast.\n\nOn X and in interviews, Newsom tried touting his accomplishments as governor. One thing is for sure, he has carefully cultivated a list of alleged accomplishments that can appeal to anyone at any time. Unfortunately, his accomplishments have accomplished very little.\n\nHomelessness is as bad as ever in California, despite us being at the tail end of a five-year period for which he announced he would \"end family homelessness.\" It hasn't ended.\n\nNewsom regularly brags about the size of California's economy, even though it has stagnated under his watch. Unsurprisingly, he was very quiet this month when the state slipped down the rankings from fourth to fifth.\n\nNewsom brags about a $20 minimum wage for fast food workers, even though the policy has merely dumped even higher prices on consumers and the industry has shed around 20,000 jobs in just a few years.\n\nNewsom is bragging about improved test scores, but a majority of students are still not proficient in math and English. Sure, the modest improvement is nice, but a majority of students aren't proficient and still aren't back to pre-pandemic levels.\n\nThe list goes on. Newsom bragged about California having the \"largest civil service program in the country,\" which is not true because the federal government does by a mile. But even if it were true, is it a good thing? He keeps spending more taxpayer dollars on highly diminishing returns - hardly an accomplishment.\n\nIt's great he's finally being honest, or at least on the verge of being honest, since he's been running a shadow presidential campaign for years. But maybe he could scrap the honesty tour and start governing effectively.",

    "body": "Gavin Newsom admits he has an eye on a 2028 presidential run, and the sad thing is: The California governor might be the best Democrats can manage.\n\nUnlike ex-Veep Kamala Harris and others (Pete Buttigieg), he can pretend he was unaware of President Joe Biden's sagging faculties without triggering open laughter.\n\nUnlike Pennsylvania's Gov. Josh Shapiro, he's toed the far-left regularly enough to (perhaps) be acceptable to the party's base, who may find running a white male non-socialist acceptable if it can get them back to power.\n\nNewsom's also put some effort into seeming quasi-moderate: In California, he's vetoed a far-left bill or three nearly every year to signal his \"reasonableness,\" but the fake moderation barely runs skin-deep.\n\nThe horrors of Los Angeles' Figueroa Street, for example, have now made national news: The red-light district sprawls along dozens of blocks, lined with preteen girls in lingerie, many plucked from the foster-care system, pimped out by cold-blooded traffickers -- so openly that the area is now known as the \"Kiddie Stroll.\"\n\nAnd Newsom bears prime responsibility, having signed the obscenely misnamed \"Safer Streets for All Act\" in 2022, which banned cops from arresting suspected prostitutes for loitering -- and so removing a key tool for police to rescue kids dragooned into the sex trade.\n\nHe's such a phony, as in a recent podcast where he cast his upbringing as a scrappy school-of-hard-knocks, claimed he grew up on \"Wonder Bread\" and \"mac and cheese\" and his mother \"hustled\" to pay bills, \"grinding every single day\" and working \"two and a half jobs\" while sports got him \"into college.\"\n\nAll bull: His mom might've work a few menial gigs post-divorce, but his father was a massively successful lawyer who managed the finances of the billionaire Getty family, which has sponsored Newsom for his entire \"business\" and political career.\n\nIn an early bout of podcast fakery, he told the late Charlie Kirk that he saw transgender athletes in girls' and women's sports as \"deeply unfair\" and admitted to Shawn Ryan that Democrats' position on gender reassignments for minors is a \"major problem\" for the party.\n\nBut he's never actually taken a firm stand that would upset the Dem base on either front.\n\nHe's slammed President Donald Trump for not being a better role model, while calling him a \"son of a bitch\" in the same breath; he's criticized his party for focusing on \"personality\" over substance, while trolling online with Trump-like social-media posting.\n\nHe's said Democrats need to make clear what they \"stand for,\" while he shapeshifts by the hour, decrying wokeism in one interview and then saying that \"anti-woke stuff is just anti-black\" in another.\n\nHe clearly expects the left-leaning national media to cover for his contradictions and for his failures from Figueroa to the Los Angeles wildfires, to hide how the Golden State is falling apart on his watch, as residents flee high taxes, high cost of living and plummeting quality of life.\n\nThe servile California media have made that easier for their national comrades, but Newsom's in for an unpleasant surprise on that front.\n\nIt's about to get a lot harder for Greasy Gavin to sell his the snake oil.",

I'm going to express my relationship to my truth with the former President of the United States, including at the end of his term, quite literally in December, which was a master class of foreign policy and domestic policy,\" Newsom said. \"There was nothing to suggest what you just said or others have suggested in terms of my interaction. That's all I can be accountable for.\"\n\nThe NBC News host then started pressing Newsom on why Harris lost the election, and whether Biden would have beaten Trump if he stayed in the race.\n\nOBAMA THE 'CAMPAIGN CLOSER' FOR DEMOCRATS IN TOP 2025 ELECTIONS AS PARTY AIMS TO REBOUND\n\nNewsom said that historical headwinds were a huge reason for the Democrats' loss, and listed several reasons as to why they lost.\n\n\"We could talk about woke. We could talk about the 107 days. We could talk about the lack of an open primary. We could talk about 'The View.' Again, I'm on page six of the 24 pages. And how you unpack that, how you stack that in terms of everything, I think needs still a little bit more forensics, a little more analysis,\" he said.\n\nNewsom revealed during an interview on Oct. 26 that he would give a possible run for the presidency serious thought after the 2026 midterm elections.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE\n\nWelker asked the Democratic governor why he wanted to be president during the \"Meet the Press\" interview.\n\nCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"I don't.

Gavin Newsom of California said Sunday that he is \"deeply confident\" that voters this week will sign off on new congressional maps that favor Democrats, framing it as part of a broader rejection of President Trump's failed leadership.\n\nSpeaking on NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" Mr. Newsom predicted that the passage of Proposition 50 in his state on Tuesday would be just one piece of what he expects to be a big election night for Democrats.\n\n\"I feel like we're on the precipice of a remarkable moment on Nov. 4,\" Mr. Newsom said on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\"\n\nMr. Newsom also weighed in on the off-year gubernatorial races, saying he expects former Rep. Abigail Spanberger to win in Virginia and Rep. Mikie Sherrill to take the governor's mansion in New Jersey.\n\nHe also praised Zohran Mamdani, the socialist who is the frontrunner to become the next mayor of New York City.\n\n\"You're going to have a dynamic young mayor, regardless of where you are in the political spectrum, that ran an extraordinary and exceptional campaign that galvanized people that, frankly, have been disenfranchised from politics,\" he said.\n\nMr. Newsom said Americans feel buyer's remorse about voting for Mr. Trump, saying he has failed to deliver on his promise to lower costs.\n\n\"This is a historically unpopular president. His policies are even more unpopular than the president himself,\" Mr. Newsom said. \"In every core category, he's underwater.\"\n\n\"He's a guy that promised to make us wealthier and healthier,\" he said. \"We're poorer and sicker, across the board.\"\n\nMr. Newsom said Mr. Trump is pushing Republican-led states to redraw their congressional lines because he knows voters are turning on him.\n\n\"He knows he's going to lose the midterms and he's trying to rig the election before one vote is cast,\" he said.",

    "title": "Gavin Newsom has high hopes  --  but rock-bottom results",
    "body": "When New York was the most populous and economically dominant state in the 19th and much of the 20th century, it was natural its governors would be quadrennial contenders for the presidency.\n\nThe Empire State sent four of its governors on to the White House (Martin Van Buren, Grover Cleveland, Theodore Roosevelt and Franklin Roosevelt) but supplied nominees or serious contenders in numerous other cycles (Samuel Tilden, Al Smith, Tom Dewey, Averell Harriman and Nelson Rockefeller, to name a few).\n\nAfter California became the most populous and prosperous state in the early 1960s, it was expected its governors would become top contenders for the Oval Office every four years.\n\nBut so far California has only sent Ronald Reagan from Sacramento to the White House.\n\nOther Golden State governors who've tried (Jerry Brown in 1976, 1980 and 1992; Pete Wilson in 1996) fell flat.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom is hoping to break the dry spell.\n\nNewsom can be opaque at times, but his ambition for the presidency is so obvious that he's dropped the usual coy clichés about how \"I'm focusing on my current job\" and instead last week admitted that \"I'd just be lying\" if he said he wasn't thinking hard about a presidential run.\n\nThis is a notable shift for Newsom, who for the last several years has repeatedly demurred from any hint, saying \"I have no idea\" \"Fate will determine,\" and even \"Who the hell knows?\" whether he would run someday.\n\nOne factor that may have forced Newsom's shift was former Vice President Kamala Harris's statement that \"I'm not done\" with public life, hinting she's strongly considering another run in 2028.\n\nIt's an open secret in California that Harris and Newsom are bitter rivals, and Newsom can't let Harris get the jump on lining up support -- and campaign-contribution pledges -- from the state's formidable Democratic money-and-influence machine.\n\nNewsom and Harris top the early opinion polls for the 2028 Democratic nomination, but at this early point such polls mostly reflect name familiarity. The past several presidential election cycles have featured early front-runners in both parties who fizzled out once real campaigning and primary voting started.\n\nNewsom, however, has been shrewdly positioning himself with aggressive steps to shore up support from the Democratic Party's ascendant progressive base. He has been visiting early primary states and putting out cheeky social-media posts aping President Trump's wild style, while Harris is content with a book tour that isn't moving many copies of her book.\n\nBy far his most bold move is Proposition 50, which Californians vote on this week. Prop. 50 will take congressional redistricting out of the hands of an \"independent\" commission (that Democrats have largely gamed to their advantage already) and return it to the Democrat-dominated state Legislature.\n\nNewsom's proposed district map will likely cost Republicans five of the nine House seats (out of 52 total) they currently have. It is meant to counterbalance moves in Republican states such as Texas to draw new congressional districts for next year that should yield big GOP gains in the House.\n\nSpecial-election initiatives in California have often backfired. Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger tried a special election package of reforms that lost badly, and Ronald Reagan's Proposition 1 in 1973 -- a tax-and-spending-limitation initiative -- also lost badly, damaging his planned 1976 presidential campaign.\n\nBut Newsom has promoted Prop. 50 as a way to \"fight Trump,\" and polls indicate his gamble is going to work, with the initiative likely to cruise to victory this week. It will be a major talking point for Democrats in other states.\n\nThere are other reasons, though, to think Newsom's shooting star will flame out in 2028. New York and California used to be swing states of a sort, electing Democrats and Republicans in roughly equal numbers to statewide office. But California especially is a deep-blue state today and not representative of the nation as a whole.\n\nNewsom's record is far to the left, with dreadful results on everything from crime to homelessness, deep budget deficits, poorly performing public schools, a high-speed-rail line to nowhere (that will never be completed), the nation's highest energy costs, unaffordable housing and an economy seemingly designed to be hostile to the middle class.\n\nIt takes almost malevolent misgovernment to drive several hundred thousand residents to leave a state with such beauty and natural advantages, but somehow monopoly Democratic rule has accomplished it.\n\nWith Hollywood and Silicon Valley both shrinking their footprint in the state, \"dynamic\" no longer applies to California, and no one will believe talk of any kind of \"California promise.\" \"Make America California\" is not going to be a winning slogan.\n\nBy the end of the 2028 campaign Newsom will wish he had just booked more dinners at the French Laundry instead.",

    "title": "Newsom claims he 'never had' concerns about Biden's capacity --...",
    "body": "California Gov. Gavin Newsom claimed Sunday that he \"never had\" any doubt about former President Joe Biden's mental capacity to run the country -- except after that one little infamous California fundraiser.\n\nAt the June 2024 fundraiser in Los Angeles, the then-prez didn't recognize megawatt celeb, co-host and longtime pal George Clooney -- leaving the actor \"shaken to the core,'' a book co-authored by CNN's Jake Tapper has said.\n\nNewsom, asked on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" whether he ever had concerns about Biden's decline in the Oval Office, insisted, I never had that.\n\n\"The one exception, as it relates to the interaction I had with him, that gave me pause, one, was the fundraiser in Southern California,\" the gov then added. \"And all of us were a little taken aback. But we also were mindful that [Biden] had been in Europe twice in about a week.\"\n\nFewer than two weeks after the fundraiser, Biden engaged in a televised debate with Donald Trump -- a disastrous showing that paved the way for the Dem to drop out of the race less than a month later.\n\nNewsom on Sunday at times appeared to ignore what nearly the entire nation -- including many of Biden's closest allies -- saw at the time.\n\nThe term-limited California governor instead stubbornly ticked off Biden's top achievements, such as the CHIPS and Science Act and the COVID-19 pandemic recovery, as examples of the former president's abilities in office.\n\n\"I just talked to the president a few hours ago. I've been privileged to have a relationship with the president,\" Newsom said.\n\nStill, Newsom -- who recently declared that Biden \"was one of the most successful presidents in the last century\" and insisted, \"I will defend that to my grave\" -- admitted that \"with grace and humility,\" he privately raised the alarms about the 46th president's debate debacle.\n\nAsked why he didn't go public with those concerns, Newsom replied, \"For me, it wasn't my job to go out there.\n\n\"My job was to let [Biden], give him the space,\" he said. \"I just have a different approach.\"\n\nNewsom also dodged a question about whether he believed Biden was fit for another four years in the White House before he dropped out.\n\n\"I think my focus was, frankly, situational,\" he said, sidestepping the question. \"It was making sure Donald Trump didn't get back into office, to experience everything that we're experiencing today. And there was no interaction I had that suggested otherwise.\"\n\nDuring his wide-ranging interview, the Golden State Democrat also addressed his recent admission that he's considering a run for president in 2028.\n\nAsked why he wants to be president, Newsom shot back, \"I'm not suggesting I am\" running.\n\n\"[There's] nothing I dislike more than a politician that sits there and lies to you. And we all just sit there rolling our eyes, going 'Give me a break.'\n\n\"We'll see what happens.\"\n\nIronically, Newsom had once drawn speculation that he could mount a 2024 primary challenge against Biden but repeatedly rejected that at the time and worked to put on a united front with the 46th president.",

    "title": "The water war Trump hasn't blown up",
    "body": "The seven states that share the West's most important river are locked in battle over who must make sharp cuts in their water use to avoid a catastrophe that could hit as soon as next summer, in which federal dam managers would have to decide between cutting water deliveries to Arizona, California and Nevada or losing hydropower production that is critical to the stability of the region's electrical grid and potentially damaging one of the nation's largest dams.\n\nThe problem has all the trappings of temptation for Trump: The region is home to two political swing states and one of Trump's favorite Democratic foes, California Gov. Gavin Newsom. There are flailing state and local officials, irate farmers and ranchers, dilapidated dams that were once the pride of American engineering, and an international treaty with Mexico.\n\nBut so far, the administration's approach to the crisis has been anything but MAGA.\n\n\"This administration is pretty much like all the other ones I've worked with,\" said Nevada's long-time Colorado River negotiator, John Entsminger.\n\nTrump hasn't wrested control of the system of dams and canals that deliver water, as he did in California's Central Valley just days after taking office, in the name of sending water to combat already-extinguished fires in Los Angeles. He hasn't sent in the National Guard, as the state of Arizona did in 1934 to protect its water rights. Trump hasn't even posted on social media about the topic.\n\nPerhaps most notably, the man his administration has tapped to run point on the Colorado River is not a Trump loyalist or a political ideologue, but a George W. Bush-era budget wonk known for his sweet tooth and pet Siamese cats, who is a self-described neophyte to the arcane and fraught world of Western water.\n\nTo be sure, Scott Cameron wasn't the administration's first choice to lead the Colorado River negotiations. Nor was he its second or even its third.\n\nBut when the White House abruptly pulled its nomination of a long-time Arizona water manager in September amid pressure from Republican senators, Cameron, who had been running river negotiations during the transition, was tapped to fill the role.\n\nAfter months of swinging between hope and fear over how the president's bare-knuckled, norm-upending style could be brought to bear upon their deadlocked negotiations, state leaders now see Cameron's pick as an indication that -- at least for now -- the Interior Department plans to step gingerly through the political landmines that surround the question of how to keep water flowing to cities, farms, tribes, mines and data centers, rather than blow them up.\n\n\"I think that the reality is the administration does not have the interest in meddling in state business,\" said Gene Shawcroft, the lead negotiator for the state of Utah.\n\nIn fact, even as the administration has aggressively sought to cancel spending under Democrats' signature climate law, it has quietly held onto the more than $2 billion left from the act's pot of funding for drought and has continued to deploy it across the West.\n\nCameron has also told state leaders that he's working to \"socialize\" the idea of using additional federal dollars to clinch a deal along the river with the White House Office of Management and Budget, which has been leveling deep cuts across federal spending, including targeting water infrastructure dollars in blue states.\n\nThe Interior Department did not respond to requests to interview Cameron nor other officials involved with the Colorado River talks.\n\nTipping toward crisis\n\nThe Colorado River's problems have been building for decades. Warming temperatures and reduced precipitation have caused its flows to shrink by 20 percent over the past quarter century. Prior droughts have been weathered thanks to the nation's two biggest reservoirs, Lake Mead and Lake Powell. But demand has outstripped supply for so long now, water levels at the lakes are plunging towards precarious lows.\n\nThe situation has set off a brawl among the states, who have been harboring grudges and animosity against each other for much of the past two decades and now must agree on new rules to govern the waterway before the current ones expire at the end of next year. If they can't, the federal government will have to decide unilaterally how to keep the system operating.\n\nAnd it's possible that there's even less time than that to work out a solution. Federal projections now show that by next August water levels at Lake Powell could drop below the hydropower heads at Glen Canyon Dam. In addition to threatening water deliveries and hydropower production, the crisis could also trigger Supreme Court litigation that could tie federal water managers' hands at the very moment they most need to be able to make operational changes to keep water flowing.\n\n\"It is literally like, if you could imagine all the worst possible conditions coming together all at once, that's exactly what's happening on the Colorado River,\" said Kathryn Sorensen, who led Phoenix's water department for years and is now with the Kyl Center for Water Policy at Arizona State University.\n\nCameron is described by state negotiators as patient, astute and keen to cobble together a deal.\n\nIn the months since he began working on the river, he has eagerly traveled across the region to see the issues on the ground, including a sweltering August trip to California's Imperial Valley, where a sprawling farm district holds the largest single claim to its flows.\n\nThe administration's approach so far has been \"incremental and institutional,\" said Chuck Cullom, executive director of the Upper Colorado River Commission, which represents the states of Colorado, Utah, New Mexico and Wyoming.\n\nCameron has set a deadline of Nov. 11 for the states to coalesce around a plan to manage the river going forward. But even that was seen as an institutional move, since every major deal among the states over the past two decades has been driven by federal deadlines and pressure.\n\nAnd Cameron's delivery was hardly belligerent. Although he spoke firmly about Interior Secretary Doug Burgum's willingness to use his authorities to manage the river unilaterally if necessary, he also described the deadline as being driven by the need for the federal government to figure out how it would actually do so if the states can't agree.\n\n\"If there's not going to be a seven-state deal, then Reclamation needs to focus its attention on what the federal action would be,\" he said during a meeting of upstream states in June.\n\nDown to the wire\n\nWith less than two weeks left ahead of that deadline now, state negotiators are meeting frequently, and have a new attendee: Andrea Travnicek, the newly Senate-confirmed assistant secretary for water and science at Interior, who is now Cameron's political boss.\n\nNegotiators are more optimistic now than they have been in months that they might be able to throw together some sort of a tentative deal that could get them through the immediate deadline -- and avoid having the problem elevated to the White House -- at least for now.\n\nBut even as they continue negotiating, the states are also quietly beefing up their legal teams in preparation for a high-stakes court fight. And they're lining up their congressional delegations around their battle lines.\n\nUpstream states have an advantage on that front, since the only Republican governors and senators in the region reside there.\n\nMeanwhile, California -- which has seen federal funding cut by the White House during the shutdown and had its water systems manipulated at the beginning of the Trump administration -- holds the largest entitlement to the river out of all seven states.\n\nJ.B. Hamby, the Golden State's lead Colorado River negotiator, has tried to dial down the tensions. It doesn't hurt that he also serves as vice chairman of the century-old southern California irrigation district with the river's largest water right and the powerful farm families there are predominantly Republican.\n\n\"On the subject of water, certainly early on in this administration's tenure there was special focus on California water issues and the president's stated goal was to ensure that water was flowing for Californians,\" he said. \"Certainly we would welcome that same approach here.\"\n\nBut the behind-the-scenes political machinations spilled out into public view in September when the White House pulled its stalled nominee for Bureau of Reclamation commissioner, longtime Arizona water manager Ted Cooke.\n\nCooke was seen as eminently qualified by just about all of the major players along the river, having spent his career working on Colorado water and power issues. But most of that career was at the Central Arizona Project, the canal system that serves the cities of Phoenix and Tucson, as well as other municipalities and tribes who are the first ones to take cuts under the laws governing the Colorado River.\n\nUpstream state leaders feared he would be biased and raised fierce objections to their lawmakers, including Utah Republican Mike Lee, who chairs the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee where Cooke's nomination was pending.\n\nLee's office did not respond to requests for comment on the nomination.\n\nA self-described Trump supporter, Cooke said he wishes the administration luck in the negotiations, despite frustration over how his nomination played out.\n\nBut, he said, he is holding his breath, hoping that the looming water crisis doesn't get pulled into the administration's efforts to inflict suffering on its political rivals.\n\n\"God, no, not when it comes to water. We just can't have that nonsense happening,\" he said. \"I pray it doesn't because it would just make things that are already in dire straits worse.\"",

    "title": "From Spielberg to Getty, these Newsom allies are sitting out his redistricting campaign",
    "body": "With just days before the vote, their dollars are conspicuously missing from the Proposition 50 fight, an absence that, as of Friday, extends to the wealthiest Californians and titans across industry. Of more than 30 billionaires who once bankrolled Newsom, only seven of them, including George Soros, put money behind the redistricting push.\n\nBigwig Hollywood producers such as former Walt Disney Studios chair and DreamWorks co-founder Jeffrey Katzenberg, \"Big Bang Theory\" co-creator Chuck Lorre and movie executive Peter Guber have not returned for the November special election.\n\nReal estate billionaire George Marcus is missing, as are two donors who had sent Newsom $1 million checks: Gap co-founder Doris Fisher and Connie Ballmer, a philanthropist married to former Microsoft CEO and Los Angeles Clippers owner Steve Ballmer.\n\nEven oil heir Gordon Getty -- a family friend who invested in Newsom's first business venture pre-politics and whose family members have been reliable Newsom backers for years -- hasn't cut a donation. A spokesperson for Getty said he doesn't comment on \"local politics.\"\n\nThe missing major donors had all hit the contribution limit for Newsom's reelection campaign in 2022, giving tens of thousands of dollars, or spent even more to help Newsom fight off a recall attempt the year before.\n\nThe no-shows reflect a rare point of potential weakness for Newsom in a redistricting campaign that has otherwise gone entirely his way. Polls suggest the measure is likely to pass, and Newsom has used it to build an army of small-dollar donors ahead of his expected 2028 presidential run.\n\nBut big-dollar donors carry weight in presidential campaigns, too, and some view these withdrawals as a warning sign for Newsom -- reflecting lingering frustration with the party's sweeping losses in 2024, fear of retribution from Trump or hesitation, even among some of California's heaviest hitters, to align themselves this early with Newsom.\n\n\"I have been really shocked at the big names that have not been on, which make me feel like this thing is more of a mandate on 'do you want to see Gavin Newsom have a successful campaign for president or not?'\" said one California-based Democratic strategist, granted anonymity to discuss conversations with donors.\n\nYet another factor has been general discomfort with the idea of gerrymandering -- the political project Newsom is championing to counter Republican-led redistricting campaigns elsewhere. Still, others expressed a desire to save their resources, given that the Prop 50 campaign is already flush with cash -- including for the likely 2028 contender himself.\n\nReal estate investor Clint Reilly said that while he's fully on board with Prop 50, \"the campaign has very ample funding,\" so he's \"holding dry powder for [the] Gavin Newsom for President Campaign.\"\n\nA former political consultant, Reilly had dropped $100,000 to defend Newsom against the 2021 recall and another $32,400 to his subsequent reelection.\n\nPOLITICO contacted more than 50 of the no-show donors directly or through representatives. Most would not comment on the record or did not respond.\n\nOne of the more prominent absent donors, Chan, during the recall had staked $750,000 to keep Newsom in office. And the charity she runs with her husband, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, put millions of dollars last year behind a ballot measure that would've lowered the voter threshold for certain bond measures so cities can borrow for housing more easily.\n\nSince Trump came into office, however, the Meta chief has pivoted to cultivate a closer relationship with the president, and the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative has continued to suspend grants focused on more progressive causes. The initiative did not respond to a request for comment about where she stands on Prop 50.\n\nOn the sidelines are several more of Newsom's old Silicon Valley donors -- many of whom built their fortunes alongside his political career through companies like Twitter, Yahoo, Napster and DoorDash. Most are now far enough removed from those companies' day-to-day operations to wade into partisan politics without risking boardroom blowback.\n\nThey include Ballmer; Napster co-founder Sean Parker and his wife, Alexandra; Laurene Powell Jobs, the billionaire investor and widow of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs; Zynga founder Mark Pincus; Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang and his wife, Akiko Yamazaki; former Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer; former Medium CEO and Twitter co-founder Evan Williams as well as DoorDash CEO Tony Xu and two of his co-founders that are still with the company.\n\nA major Democratic fundraiser granted anonymity to discuss sensitive matters said Newsom loyalists know they have to be cautious about drawing unwanted attention. They've tended to enjoy a lower profile than Democratic megadonors more closely affiliated with national party causes like the Soros family, and GOP operatives are likely to scrutinize the funders of Prop 50.\n\n\"Republicans are trying to kneecap a leading candidate for president in '28. So if you're one of Gavin's biggest, biggest supporters, and you're planning on writing a really big check for his presidential campaign, don't start now,\" said the fundraiser. \"Don't go to the well prematurely on a different initiative that could be funded by others.\"\n\nBut the first Democratic strategist said most no-show donors they knew were steering clear of Prop 50 to avoid bolstering Newsom ahead of 2028.\n\n\"Eighty to 90 percent of those folks just don't want to get involved in the Newsom for President campaign this early,\" they said.\n\nNewsom's Prop 50 push has significantly expanded his small-dollar donor base to tap for 2028. His fundraising raked in more than 100,000 contributors who had not given to his previous statewide campaigns or federal committee, a separate POLITICO analysis found.\n\nIn an unusual show of confidence eight days out from the election, Newsom's political operation told smaller online donors to stop, as its goals had been met. The anti-Prop 50 operation all but collapsed during the final stretch after being outspent two to one.\n\nNathan Click, a spokesperson for the Prop 50 effort who ran communications for several of Newsom's statewide campaigns, said the campaign drew \"unprecedented support from across the Democratic Party,\" grassroots activists, Washington party committees and large donors alike.\n\n\"In addition to raising more than $120 million for Prop 50, Governor Newsom has also been spearheading fundraising efforts for national Democratic groups focused on redistricting efforts nationwide -- working closely with House Democrats and many of his longtime donors on the effort,\" he said in a statement.\n\nThe Prop 50 campaign has made countering Trump its central selling point, and that agenda is not entirely without the support of big donors. At least 15 people -- roughly a fifth -- of those who contributed at least $64,800 to one of Newsom's last two campaigns also gave for Prop 50. Two of the past Newsom donors have died since his last reelection and were excluded from the analysis.\n\nThe single largest funder in favor of Prop 50 is a group founded and funded by Soros, the liberal megadonor who gave $10 million. The president has repeatedly called for him to be jailed as he escalates threats to leverage federal power against his political enemies, saying in October his administration would investigate whether Soros financed the \"No Kings\" protests. (The White House did not respond to a request for comment.)\n\n\"Prop 50 is critical to ensuring we can actually have fair midterm elections in 2026 and blocking Trump's unprecedented redistricting power grab,\" said a spokesperson for his son, Alex Soros, who has been handed control of the family's $25 billion philanthropic empire. \"Mr. Soros was encouraged to see Governor Newsom and House Democrats take on this important fight, and we are glad to support it.\"\n\nNetflix co-founder Reed Hastings, whom AI company Anthropic appointed to its board this year, sent a $2 million check to the Prop 50 campaign. He had exceeded that by spending $3 million against the recall and said his motivations this time are far broader.\n\n\"I'm a big fan of Gavin Newsom, thus the earlier donations. He is a gifted political strategist and a futurist,\" Hastings said over email. \"Prop 50 I would have supported whether Gavin was involved or not. I see it as fairness relative to Texas redistricting.\"\n\nOther former Newsom benefactors who showed up for Prop 50 include former Google CEO Eric Schmidt with half a million dollars; philanthropist Mark Heising with $500,000; private investment firm chair Andrew Hauptman with $300,000; Hyatt heir John Pritzker with $250,000; agricultural billionaires Stewart and Lynda Resnick with $125,000 each; Levi Strauss descendent John Goldman and his wife Marcia with $50,000 each; sitcom creator James Brooks with $10,000 as well as San Francisco socialite Dede Wilsey with $5,000.\n\nProp 50 has also enjoyed support from new donors in the billionaire class, such as $2.5 million from venture capitalist and Trump critic Michael Moritz, who used to lead Sequoia Capital, and a combined $1.1 million from Phoebe Gates, the daughter of Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, and her brother, Rory.\n\nMost of Newsom's biggest past donors are not spending for him in the Prop 50 war, though.\n\nPowell Jobs spent $400,000 to oppose Newsom's recall but has not made a political contribution for Prop 50 or anything else in the state since last spring.\n\nHastings' wife, Patty Quillin, did not match his contribution to Prop 50 after previously maxing out for Newsom. The Netflix co-founder clarified that the $2 million was on behalf of him alone.\n\nSports mogul and chair of the 2028 LA Olympics organizing committee, Casey Wasserman, does not plan to make a contribution to Prop 50. Susan Pritzker hasn't shown up after giving more than $164,000 between the last Newsom campaigns.\n\nNotably, Conway, who is working with former Speaker Nancy Pelosi to help fundraise for the effort, has not personally donated to Prop 50. He and a spokesperson did not respond to inquiries about his plans.\n\nConway has been vocal about his views on the measure, telling POLITICO this summer that no one can afford to sit out \"when the future of our democracy is at stake\" and that Texas Republicans are trying to \"keep one political party in power forever.\" He's brought it to the attention of at least one other Silicon Valley donor, Y Combinator co-founder Paul Graham, who came through with $500,000.\n\nA fellow Democratic megadonor, Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen, who said he thinks the governor's \"bold\" approach to redistricting is necessary, has not chipped in either.\n\nThrough a spokesperson, he declined to comment further on Prop 50.\n\nMethodology: POLITICO used California Secretary of State data to analyze Proposition 50 contributions for a list of 73 individual donors as of Friday. They represent people who gave the maximum contribution allowed to both the primary and general election for Newsom's most recent gubernatorial campaign -- a combined $64,800 in 2022 -- or donated at least that amount to oppose his recall attempt the year before. Two of those individuals died in the years since and were left out of POLITICO's calculations.",

    "title": "Newsom considers running for president ... on what record?",
    "body": "California's Governor Gavin Newsom recently announced that he'd consider running as the Democratic candidate for a 2028 presidential bid. If he does, Newsom will have a lot of explaining to do about the lackluster California economy that he's presided over.\n\nNewsom became the governor in 2019, just before the COVID recession hit. No one can blame Newsom for that, even though the draconian state response to the pandemic, such as closing K-12 schools for an extensive period, has been widely and legitimately criticized.\n\nMore to the point in considering Newsom's presidential candidacy is his economic record as governor. Over the 2022Q2 to 2025Q2 recovery since the pandemic ended, California's job growth was only 2.0 percent, less than half the national average of 4.4 percent. In a ranking of all 50 states over the same period, California's 2.0 percent job growth placed the state at a rank of #48. Not surprisingly, California also ranks #48 in overall taxation according to the Tax Foundation's 2024 State Business Tax Climate Index.\n\nHigh relative state taxes not only drive out jobs, but they also drive out people. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the net population outflow (inflow minus outflow) for California from 2021 to 2023 was more than one million people. The top five outbound destinations for people leaving California were states with zero or very low state income taxes: Texas, Arizona, Nevada, Idaho, and Florida.\n\nThe most recent IRS data on net income inflows is 2022, where the average adjusted gross income (AGI) for those leaving California was $134,000 versus $113,000 for those entering the state. The total AGI leaving California in 2022 was $52.9 billion, as compared to an inflow of $28.9 billion, resulting in a net loss in California's AGI of $24 billion, even greater than California's net loss in AGI of $20.2 billion in 2021.\n\nMore unsettling for California's economic future is the sharp decline in the number of Advanced Industries establishments in California as a percentage of all such establishments in the U.S. \"Advanced Industries\" refers to the number of establishments in high-value-added sectors, such as technology, software development, aerospace, and medical products. This Advanced Industry series for 50 different MSAs is tracked by the Chapman-University of California, Irvine Innovation Index.\n\nThe percentage of advanced establishments in the 7 MSAs we track in California (Orange County, Los Angeles, Sacramento, Riverside-San Bernardino, San Diego, San Francisco, San Jose) dropped steadily from 17% of all advanced establishments in the U.S. in 2018Q1 to 14.9 percent in 2025Q1.\n\nDuring that same seven-year period, the number of advanced industry establishments increased by 21.6 percent in California, about half the 42.7 percent increase in advanced jobs in the U.S. (net of California). For the MSAs located in the 10 states ranking lowest in overall state and local taxation, the disparity is even greater: California's 21.6 percent increase from 89,300 to 108,600 advanced industry establishments was roughly half the increase of 52.2 percent for the low-tax states from 164,000 to 249,600 establishments over the same 2018Q1 to 2025Q1 period.\n\nOn the housing front, a major plank during Newsom's first campaign for governor was to fix California's housing shortage, a shortage Newsom blamed for the state's high housing prices. He pledged as governor that he'd lead the change in building 3.5 million new homes by 2025. Although this goal was patently absurd (To meet the goal, annual new home construction would have to quadruple), Newsom said, \"I realize building 3.5 million units is an audacious goal,\" but he continued, \"it's achievable.\"\n\nIt wasn't. Instead of increasing new home construction to 400,000 units per year, the number remained in a narrow range of 100,000 to 125,000 units. Even the governor seems to have given up on his \"audacious\" goal. His budget now projects that annual new home construction through 2028 will remain in the 100,000 to 104,000 range.\n\nInstead of bringing down housing prices, they continued to increase from $525,000 in 2018 to $773,000 in 2023. The median home prices were exceeded only by Hawaii in both years. In 2019, when Newsom became governor, the housing affordability index in California was 93, meaning that median family income in the state was 93 percent of that necessary to meet the principal and interest (P&I) payments on a median-priced home. By 2024, the affordability index in California had declined even more to 59 compared to an average affordability index in the U.S. of 121. Instead of median family income being 21 percent above that needed to buy a home, as it was in the U.S., in California, it was 41 percent below what was needed to cover P&I.\n\nThe list of California's economic problems goes on and on. Homelessness in the state is the worse in the nation. Home insurance costs have skyrocketed. Instead of zeroing in on California's rigid price controls in that industry as the culprit, the Newsom administration is blaming insurance companies. Same story for gasoline. According to the governor, it's not California's energy policy that's at fault for its current $4.59 price per gallon of gas as compared to $3.40 in the U.S.: it's the oil industry to blame.\n\nGiven the gravity of California's economic woes, it's difficult to see how Newsom will explain it all away in a run for the presidency. More likely, he'll ignore it and focus instead on positioning himself as the candidate most Anti-Trump. Rather than following the phrase James Carville coined, \"It's the economy, stupid.\" Newsom will likely be following his own dictum: \"It's Donald Trump, stupid.\"",

    "title": "Why Gavin Newsom is gambling on new rules for Trump 2.0",
    "body": "Newsom has discarded Democrats' \"when they go low, we go high\" mantra.\n\nAt the beginning of the year, California Gov. Gavin Newsom's tenure was marked by devastating wildfires in Los Angeles, a steady stream of ridicule from the White House, and backlash from within the Democratic Party for siding with conservatives on transgender athletes in women's sports.\n\nNot to mention, in the summer of 2021, Newsom weathered a blistering attempt to recall him from office -- his starpower at risk.\n\nYet the twice-elected governor has pulled off a reputational heel turn, marked by viral Trump-mocking social media posts and parody MAGA merch coupled with a statewide redistricting measure that would level Republican's attempt to get an edge ahead of next year's midterms.\n\nNow, Newsom is a leader running miles ahead of others, experts explained to ABC News.\n\nOne of the most noticeable transformations was the rebrand of Newsom's official governor social media account. A senior Newsom official told ABC that the weekend of June 6, when the team learned the president was federalizing the National Guard into Los Angeles, was when the \"red line\" was crossed, and a more defiant version of the Democratic governor debuted.\n\n\"That is when everything changed, with the governor, with our social media,\" the official said.\n\nOn June 10, Newsom's @GovPressOffice account shared a TikTok video, where a voiceover, in the style of a Star Wars villain, mimicked Trump's TruthSocial post announcing the federalization of troops. That post generated over 800,000 views.\n\nThe salvo continued. The same day, Newsom, on Instagram, responded to Trump mocking him as \"Newscum\" on Truth Social with a diss-video set to the Taylor Swift (another common Trump target) song \"You Need To Calm Down,\" dismissing Trump as \"keyboard warrior.\" That short video has 11.3 million views.\n\nThe mocking never let up.\n\nA non-exhaustive list of the incoming includes: accusing Trump of having \"Newsom Derangement Syndrome,\" a play on Trump's oft-referred \"Trump Derangement Syndrome;\" likening Trump adviser Stephen Miller to Voldemort, the villain from the Harry Potter series, and calling him submissive; calling Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem \"Kosplay Kristi\" and urging followers to \"hide yo dogs,\" a reference to Noem's infamous tale of shooting and killing her own dog, Cricket; mocking Vice President JD Vance over a debunked rumor that he performed sex acts with a couch; and comparing White House border czar Tom Homan to an uncooked ham.\n\nSince then, Newsom's social media accounts have skyrocketed. Follower counts across multiple platforms for his non-government account, @GavinNewsom, ballooned -- growing to more than 11 million followers collectively. Nearly half of those followers were new this year.\n\nOne of the official accounts, @GovPressOffice, has seen nearly 1 billion impressions on X since those first provocative posts in June, per Newsom's campaign.\n\nNewsom even launched his own \"patriot\" merchandise shop, repurposing Trump's Make America Great Again slogan -- Make America Gavin Again -- and selling REAL PATRIOT hats NEWSOM WAS RIGHT ABOUT EVERYTHING! And REAL PATRIOT hats, and kneepads marked with Trump's signature.\n\nA key mark in Newsom's success is upending the \"when they go low, we go high\" mantra coined by Michelle Obama in 2016, suggested Parker Butler, the former director of Kamala Harris' presidential campaign's buzzy social media channel, @KamalaHQ. \"That is not where we are right now.\"\n\n\"When we see democracy hanging by a thread, we have to take risks. It feels very unrestrained, that's the kind of energy that I think Democrats need,\" said Butler, now a digital strategist and co-founder at Luminary Strategies.\n\n\"We need to throw the sort of old rulebook out the window,\" Butler added.\n\nWhen Newsom launched his new solo podcast \"This is Gavin Newsom\" in March, he said he wanted to \"debate without demeaning\" and engage with people most members his party wouldn't dare to speak to. He called the Democratic brand \"toxic.\" He's positioned himself as a lefty alternative in the GOP-de-jour manosphere space. His interview with Charlie Kirk, for instance, has 1.3 million YouTube views.\n\n\"When we go low, or when they go low, we go high, doesn't work when they're trying to pull the rug out completely from under us,\" said Olivia Julianna, a Gen-Z digital strategist and activist who spoke at the Democratic National Convention. Julianna was outraged with Newsom at the start of the year, in part due to his right-wing podcast guests, but she now considers herself a huge fan -- she's even bought his merch.\n\n\"I did not take Gavin Newsom seriously until he made it clear that he was ready to take action,\" Julianna added.\n\nNewsom's longtime speechwriter and former deputy chief of staff Jason Eliott described the online mockery as a strategy of \"holding up a mirror to the clown show that is the Trump administration. We're not doing anything differently than what they are doing.\"\n\nElliott said the buzz around Newsom's posts creates space for the \"actual substantive work,\" like Proposition 50, the ballot initiative that, if approved by voters on Tuesday, will temporarily adopt a new congressional map that redraws five districts to be more Democratic-leaning, potentially flipping five existing Republican seats in the midterms. Elliott said that since the office has sharpened its tone, donations have poured in from millions of supporters.\n\n\"How do you get 1.2 million people from all 50 states all across the country to buy into this defense of democracy? You do it by getting attention,\" Eliott said.\n\nNewsom, in a recent interview with ABC News' Jonathan Karl, concurred.\n\n\"We're trying to have a little humor in this process as well, and we're fighting fire with fire, not just rhetorically, in the context of that back and forth, but substantively, we can get into the 43 lawsuits, we can get in the work we're trying to do on Prop 50,\" Newsom explained.\n\n\"We're trying to have a little humor in this process as well, and we're fighting fire with fire, not just rhetorically, in the context of that back and forth, but substantively, we can get into the 43 lawsuits, we can get in the work we're trying to do on Prop 50,\" Newsom explained.\n\nJohn Dennis, former chair of the San Francisco Republican Party, said Newsom's tactic is the latest iteration of what he and other critics call a history of \"shapeshifting.\"\n\n\"He doesn't know who he is. So he's trying to be everybody else,\" Dennis said.\n\nBut he admits it appears to be working.\n\n\"This Prop 50 move is a very clever move for the Democrats. And he's got good people around him,\" Dennis said. \"They know that Trump is the center of the universe right now so he's just keeping his name alive and positioning himself as the Trump fighter -- and he's going to run that all the way into the Democrat primaries.\"\n\nDan Schnur, a longtime California political analyst and UC-Berkeley professor, called the Proposition 50 campaign \"a self-delivered political gift for Newsom.\"\n\nNewsom's successes put him in a solid position to launch a presidential bid, an ambition Californians are under no illusions about.\n\n\"Every governor looks in the mirror and sees a president looking back at them, and Newsom probably whistles \"Hail to the Chief\" when he's in the shower every morning,\" Schnur said. \"It's hard to predict exactly how the race plays out, but the governor of the largest state in the country, who is also the most visible and impactful Trump critic, and who has access to tremendous amounts of fundraising dollars could be a pretty formidable contender.\"",

    "body": "This is read by an automated voice. Please report any issues or inconsistencies here.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom, former Vice President Kamala Harris and a slew of other national and California Democrats on Saturday rallied supporters to stay fired up in seeking passage of a ballot measure to redraw the state's congressional districts ahead of the midterm elections.\n\nWhile polling suggests Proposition 50 is likely to pass Tuesday, volunteers must continue knocking on doors, phone banking and motivating voters through Election Day, they said. Newsom told volunteers they ought to follow the model of sprinters, leaving it all on the field.\n\n\"We cannot afford to run the 90-yard dash. You Angelenos, you've got the Olympics coming in 2028. They do not run the 90-yard dash. They run the 110-yard dash. We have got to be at peak on Election Day,\" Newsom told hundreds of supporters at the Convention Center in downtown Los Angeles. \"We cannot take anything for granted.\"\n\nHours earlier, Republican spoke out against the ballot measure at John Wayne Park in Newport Beach, before sending teams into neighborhoods to drum up votes for their side.\n\n\"What Proposition 50 will do is disenfranchise, meaning, disregard all Republicans in the state of California,\" said state Assembly member Diane Dixon (R-Newport Beach). \"Ninety percent of 6 million [Californian Republicans] will be disenfranchised.\"\n\nProposition 50 would redraw California's congressional districts in an attempt to boost the number of Democrats in Congress. The effort was proposed by Newsom and other California Democrats in hope of blunting President Trump's push in Texas and other GOP-led states to increase the number of Republicans elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in next year's midterm election. But even if voters approve the ballot measure that could flip five California districts currently represented by Republicans, it's unclear whether that will be enough to shift control of the House unless there is a blue wave in the 2026 election.\n\nThe party that wins control of the House will shape Trump's final two years in the White House -- whether he is able to continue enacting his agenda or faces a spate of investigations and possibly another impeachment attempt.\n\nThe special election is among the costliest ballot measures in state history. More than $192 million has flowed into various campaign committees since state lawmakers voted in August to put the proposition on the ballot. Supporters of the redistricting effort have raised exponentially more money than opponents, and polling shows the proposition is likely to pass.\n\nAs of Friday, more than a quarter of the state's 23 million registered voters had cast ballots, with Democrats outpacing Republicans.\n\nNewsom was joined Saturday by Harris, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, Sens. Adam Schiff and Alex Padilla of California and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Rep. Jasmine Crockett of Texas, other Democrats and labor leaders.\n\nHarris, in a surprise appearance at the gathering, argued that the Trump administration is implementing long-sought GOP goals such as voter suppression.\n\n\"This fight is not about sitting by and complaining, 'Oh, they're cheating,'\" the former vice president said. \"It's about recognizing what they are up to. There is an agenda that we are witnessing which feels chaotic, I know, but in fact, we are witnessing a high velocity event that is about the swift implementation of a plan that has been decades in the making.\"\n\nSeveral of the speakers referred to the immigration raids that started in Los Angeles in June and deep cuts to federal safety nets, including the nutrition assistance program for low-income families and a health coverage for seniors and the disabled.\n\n\"We know there's so much on the line this Tuesday. And a reminder, Tuesday is not Election Day -- it's the last day to vote,\" Padilla said. \"Don't wait till Tuesday. Get your ballots in folks.... As good as the polls look, we need to run up the score on this because the eyes of the country are going to be on California on Tuesday. And we need to win and we need to win big.\"\n\nPadilla, a typically staid legislator, then offered a modified riff of a lyric by rapper Ice Cube, who grew up in South Los Angeles.\n\n\"Donald Trump -- you better check yourself before you wreck America,\" said Padilla, who is considering running for governor next year.\n\nNearly 50 miles southeast, about 50 Republican canvassers fueled up on coffee and donuts, united over the brisk weather and annoyance about Newsom's attempt to redraw California's congressional districts.\n\nWill O'Neill, chairman of the Orange County Republican Party, equated this final push against Proposition 50 as the California GOP's game 7 -- a nod to tonight's World Series battle between the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Toronto Blue Jays.\n\n\"Orange County right now is the only county in Southern California that has a shot of having more Republicans than Democrats voting,\" said O'Neill. \"We expect that over the next three days, around 70% of everyone who votes is gonna vote 'no' on 50. But we need them to vote.\"\n\nO'Neill labeled the measure a \"hyper-partisan power grab.\" If Proposition 50 passes, it will dilute Republican power in Orange County by splitting communities and roping some residents into districts represented by Los Angeles County politicians.\n\nDixon also rallied volunteers -- which included a handful of college students from across the state: \"Be polite. Just say thank you very much. Just like Charlie Kirk would. Don't [stimulate] an argument. Just be friendly.\"\n\n\"They're squeezing out what very little representation Republicans have in the state,\" said Kristen Nicole Valle, president of the Orange County Young Republicans.\n\n\"We will not be hearing from 40% of Californians if Prop. 50 passes.\"\n\nRandall Avila, executive director of the Orange County GOP, said the measure disenfranchises Latino GOP voters like himself.\n\nNationally, Trump managed to gain 48% of the Latino vote, a Pew Research study showed, which proved crucial to his second presidential victory.\n\n\"Obviously our community has kind of shown we're willing to switch parties and go another direction if that elected official or that party isn't serving us,\" said Avila. \"So it's unfortunate that some of those voices are now gonna be silenced with a predetermined winner in their district.\"\n\nNot all hope is lost for Republicans if Proposition 50 is approved, Avila said. A handful of seats could be snagged by Republicans, including the districts held by Reps. Dave Min (D-Irvine) and Derek Tran (D-Orange).\n\n\"If the lines do change, that doesn't mean we pack up and go home,\" he said. \"Just means we reorganize, we reconfigure things, and then we keep fighting.\"",

    "body": "During an interview aired on Saturday's broadcast of \"NewsNation Prime,\" Sen. John Fetterman (D-PA) responded to a question on California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) trying to shift to the center and if that's the right move for the party by saying that \"Everyone's going to go into the middle. But people [forget] that the Internet exists and all of the clips and all of the outlandish things that they've said or they've done,\" and answered a question on if Newsom will have his past stances come back to bite him by stating that \"everyone will\" have that problem.\n\nHost Natasha Zouves said, \"We have seemingly seen Newsom shift more to the middle on hot-button issues.\" After playing a clip of Newsom talking about men in women's sports with Charlie Kirk, she asked, \"You alluded to this earlier. Do you think the shift to the center really has to be the right move for the party going forward, whether it's Newsom or anyone else?\"\n\nFetterman responded, \"Everyone's going to go into the middle. But people [forget] that the Internet exists and all of the clips and all of the outlandish things that they've said or they've done, that's going to have about 20 or 30 million dollars that can pound you for those things. So, it's like, for all of the things that you say right now or the things now, you want to pander or monetize faux outrage now, you're going to pay when you actually have to run in an election that you're accountable, when you actually have Republicans and Democrat[s] and you have a purple situation where you have to find a way forward. And that's exactly what I've been trying to do here during my time here in the Senate.\"\n\nZouves then asked, \"So, as we see Newsom trying to position himself as more centrist, more moderate, do you think that some things in the past are going to come back to haunt him?\"\n\nFetterman answered, \"Well, they're all going -- everyone will. They'll pander, scream to the base, and then now -- then they're going to have to try to just walk it back or now just pretend that all these things weren't said or done. That's how it works. And that's one thing I refuse to do.\"",

    "body": "Trisha Swift, from Orange County, was dressed in a suffragette outfit with a button and sign that read \"Yes on Prop 50.\" Swift was one of hundreds of volunteers invited to attend a rally in Los Angeles on Saturday, Nov. 1, that recognized them for their phonebanking and campaign efforts for Proposition 50.\n\n\"This is our lives and we need to do something about it,\" Swift said, being moved to help by donating to the campaign and phonebanking in the past couple of weeks. \"I want my kids to be able to live here and have a life they deserve.\"\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom, along with other electeds from across California and the nation, hosted the rally at the Los Angeles Convention Center with hundreds in attendance to celebrate the efforts on behalf of Prop. 50.\n\nThe proposition is the mid-decade redistricting effort to adopt new, gerrymandered maps impacting California's congressional districts to benefit Democrats. Newsom and others who support the move say they're doing this to counter similar gerrymandering efforts by Republicans in red states who, at the urging of President Donald Trump, are trying to secure additional seats for the GOP to ensure their party retains control of the House after next year's midterm elections.\n\nProposition 50 opponents' message to Californians has focused on voters choosing \"good governance,\" rather than partisan politics.\n\nJessica Millan Patterson, the former head of the California Republican Party who is leading the No on 50 camp said last week that she believes there are voters, on either side of the political aisle, who believe this mid-cycle redistricting is wrong.\n\nDuring Saturday's event, elected officials shared remarks about the importance of the election not only benefiting Californians but also making an impact across the country.\n\n\"They never expected this,\" Newsom said during the rally. \"It is not about Trump, this election, at the end of the day it's about the future of our country.\n\n\"The future is not in front of us, it's inside of us,\" Newsom added. \"Thank you for all that you have done to get us to this remarkable moment in this campaign. Over the next 72 hours let's bring home this historic victory for democracy.\"\n\nFormer Vice President Kamala Harris made an appearance and shared similar sentiments.\n\n\"I want to thank everyone here, all the folks who have been canvassing, knocking on doors, talking with your friends and neighbors,\" Harris said, \"taking with all folks about the power of the people, because that's what this is about. It is about reminding folks that we refuse to knwwl at the foot of a tyrant.\"\n\nPeople in California and across the country still believe in the power of the vote, Harris added, and are prepared to fight fire with fire.\n\nOther elected officials from the Los Angeles area and California spoke during the event, including L.A. Mayor Karen Bass, county Supervisor Holly Mitchell, Rep. Sydney Kamlager-Dove, Rep. Judy Chu, Sen. Adam Schiff and Sen. Alex Padilla.\n\n\"Another reminder of what's on the line; have you seen what our country's been going through this year?\" Padilla said. \"Billionaires are getting richer, our health care is getting cut, they're cutting nutrition assistance programs, and reproductive rights are being threatened.\"\n\n\"I think by voting, and voting loudly, yes on Prop. 50,\" Padilla added, \"California is going to be sending a message.\"\n\nMinnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar and Texas Rep. Jasmine Crockett also spoke and reminded the crowd and overall Californians of the important impact voting on Prop. 50 would have on other states as well.\n\nRepresentatives from various unions, including the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor, California Federation of Labor Unions, California Nurses Association, and Service Employees International Union, also thanked volunteers for their work, and other groups - like Roots and Wings - shared the work that members have contributed to canvas for the proposition.\n\n\"Prop. 50 is not just a ballot measure,\" said SEIU President April Verrett. \"Prop. 50 is a moral line in the sand. It says this country belongs to all of us.\"\n\nFormer California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, during a talk with Chapman University students last week, sharply criticized the proposition, declaring it an example of \"tit-for-tat\" political tactics.\n\n\"They're trying to tell the people they have to out-cheat the Republicans in order to fight fire with fire, to preserve democracy in America,\" Schwarzenegger said about the proponents of Prop. 50. \"In the meantime, they're destroying and tearing up the constitution in California.\"\n\nSchwarzenegger added: \"I think America is going through a very difficult time. Politicians think first about their parties, then they think about the people.\"",

    "body": "This is read by an automated voice. Please report any issues or inconsistencies here.\n\nA law that allowed the sharing of limitless amounts of personal data across the state to find people eligible for CalFresh was rescinded this week.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom signed Assembly Bill 593 by Assemblymember Buffy Wicks, a Democrat from Oakland, that forbids state and local departments from sharing sensitive personal data to increase food stamp enrollment.\n\nBut only a year ago, it was Wicks who introduced that same data sharing initiative, to get more people enrolled in CalFresh, the state's federally funded food assistance program. Her bill from last year, Assembly Bill 518, granted state and local public entities involved in education, crime, employment, and other areas the authority to override all state privacy laws to share data about people who could potentially get CalFresh.\n\nCalFresh is funded by the federal government, run by the state Department of Social Services and administered locally. Over 1 in 5 Californians are food insecure. About 5 million Californians are CalFresh recipients, and the state estimates almost 2 million more are eligible and haven't signed up.\n\nAround 200,000 college students in California receive CalFresh, according to the California Department of Social Services. All recipients must complete an application process many consider time-consuming and confusing.\n\nIn May, 20,000 college students applied for CalFresh, and over half of the applications were denied, often because the student couldn't prove they were eligible, according to the social services department. CalFresh coordinators say students are unaware of their own eligibility, making outreach important. Through data sharing, Wicks intended to identify demographic groups as well as individuals who are eligible for CalFresh, and develop marketing that would appeal to them.\n\nIn July, Wicks told a Senate committee she had changed her strategy to ensure data could not be shared beyond what is necessary for CalFresh outreach.\n\nShe said limitations on data sharing were increasingly important as the \"federal government is attempting to weaponize state data to actively prosecute a subset of Californians.\" In June, the federal government shared Medicaid data with the Department of Homeland Security for the stated purpose of monitoring alleged Medicaid fraud. In September, Newsom signed Senate Bill 81, which protects medical data from immigration authorities, effective immediately.\n\nThe feds have also asked for CalFresh data. In May, the U.S. Department of Agriculture requested all state agencies send names, addresses and Social Security numbers of people who either received or applied for food assistance, as well as the calculated value of all the benefits allotted over time. The department cited an executive order by President Trump as the basis for the request.\n\nCalifornia's Atty. Gen. Rob Bonta and others representing Democratic states sued the Trump administration in July to prevent this data collection. On Oct. 15, a Northern California court issued a preliminary injunction temporarily blocking the transfer of CalFresh recipient data to the agriculture department.\n\nThe previous law that allowed data sharing was originally written to expand paid family leave, but the bill was deactivated in September 2023. Wicks and co-author Assemblymember Corey Jackson, a Democrat from Riverside, reintroduced the bill in late August 2024, with an entirely new focus on CalFresh. Within one month, it passed both the Assembly and the Senate and was approved by the governor.\n\nThe law granted state and local entities the authority to flag Californians eligible for CalFresh, allowing them to bypass all existing state laws to do so. The law authorized departments overseeing justice, veteran services, employment, financial aid, and homelessness, as well as all three public higher education systems, to share data. Types of data included utility bills, criminal records, immigration and tax records, and health information.\n\nThere was no limit on what kinds of information could be shared, which Bill Essayli, acting U.S. Central Dist. Atty. and former Republican assemblymember representing the 63rd Assembly District, criticized.\n\nEnd Child Poverty California, an advocacy network fighting to eradicate poverty, supported the previous law, saying data sharing could streamline CalFresh enrollment. If the state were provided data, they argued, households wouldn't have to submit their own verification proving their food stamp eligibility, which could speed up the process.\n\nThough the original law was entered late in the 2024 session, it garnered several opponents, including the ACLU, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, and Oakland Privacy. The latter group argued to the Senate that the \"preposterously broad\" bill didn't let Californians opt in or out of data sharing.\n\nAssemblymember Alex Lee, a Democrat from San Jose, concurred with Oakland Privacy that the bill was \"far too broad.\"\n\n\"I'm deeply concerned how this will impact low-income individuals,\" Lee had said on the Assembly floor. \"This population deserves the same privacy as everyone in this room.\"\n\nLee as well as Essayli took issue with the gut-and-amend process that allowed the legislators to completely change the bill without approval from any Assembly policy committees. When bills are rushed in this way, Essayli said, they \"can have unintended consequences.\"\n\nHowever, Wicks promised to add clauses limiting the bill's scope during the following year. Four assemblymembers voted no on the bill, three of them Republicans and the last one being Lee. Newsom signed the bill into law on Sept. 28, 2024.\n\nWicks proposed initial drafts of the clean-up bill in early 2025. Early drafts set some limits on the scope of shareable data, but were \"pretty weak,\" according to Tracy Rosenberg, advocacy director for Oakland Privacy.\n\nAnother draft of the bill removed the sharing of public data related to income and health. It also required the data only be used for CalFresh outreach, facilitating enrollment, and measuring impact. To Rosenberg, this \"catch-all\" language was still too broad, and still would have \"justified ... using the data for all kinds of things.\"\n\nOakland Privacy collaborated with Wicks to draft this year's bill, and Rosenberg noted Wicks was very open to protecting people's privacy. \"We think the changing political environment probably played a role,\" she said.\n\nAs proven by federal probes into Medi-Cal data, Rosenberg said, California's social services department couldn't guarantee their data was safe from federal interference. \"That was certainly a concern in 2024, but it's a much bigger concern in 2025,\" she said.\n\nFinally, after facing Senate amendments, the last bill draft removed authorization for the data sharing entirely. The bill passed the Senate and Assembly with only two dissenting votes in total, and was signed by Newsom and chaptered into law on Oct. 13.\n\nNot all aspects of the data sharing law were rescinded this week. For example, the state social services department is still tasked with developing a methodology for estimating the rate of CalFresh participation, to be released to the public each year.\n\nThe department will also determine the typical characteristics of people who are CalFresh-eligible, including but not limited to \"race, ethnicity, preferred language, age, and location.\" The department is required to develop marketing schemes that correspond to these demographics. Promoting CalFresh in underserved communities could make for more \"equitable\" SNAP access, Jackson said.\n\nThe department is also required to identify all public data sets that could name potential CalFresh participants.\n\nState social services will not receive county data under this new law. But according to the people who run CalFresh programs at colleges and universities, analyzing participation is critical at the local level.\n\nAt Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, almost 30% of all students are on CalFresh, according to Olivia Watts, program manager of CalFresh outreach at the university. She largely attributes the program's success to their close relationship with the San Luis Obispo Department of Social Services.\n\nThrough the data provided by that department, the university learned that half of all CalFresh applicants in the county are its students.\n\nThe data they receive is scrubbed of personal information, Watts said. It's just numbers, which she said are integral to CalFresh functionality. \"Without knowing how many students are enrolled, it makes it difficult for us to do our job, to really see, are we making progress?\"\n\nOther university programs strive for that kind of open information. Amy Gonzales, Cal Fresh director at Chico State, has repeatedly requested CalFresh participation data from her local social services department in Butte County. They rejected the requests.\n\nBut according to Tiffany Rowe, director of Butte County's Department of Employment and Social Services, the department doesn't have direct access to that data, and would have to request it from the state. If they had that data, she said, they wouldn't deny Chico State's access.\n\nWith access to data, Gonzales said, the CalFresh program at Chico State could improve its outreach initiatives. They could attempt to target student groups that are eligible but under-enrolled.\n\nGonzales would be \"all about\" data sharing, even across the state, as long as the information is shared with \"trusted\" agencies. \"I think it can be very beneficial to share that eligibility data,\" she said, and flag people for different social service programs based on their characteristics.\n\nStill, Gonzales manages to conduct outreach without countywide data. At Chico State, she partners with some of the college's academic programs and workplaces to find students eligible for CalFresh.\n\nCollege students are eligible for food assistance based on their participation in employment training programs. Certain majors count toward this criteria. Students are often unaware of their eligibility, which is why targeted outreach is important, Gonzales said.\n\nBut though she'd appreciate data on eligible people, \"I do have concerns with data sharing, given the current administration's priorities and what they have requested,\" she said.\n\nWatts and Gonzales both help students at their universities with CalFresh applications. They both said they wish that all college students were automatically eligible for the program.\n\nUnder the new law, counties can continue to harvest data about the efficacy of their own CalFresh programs. They're just prevented from sharing data on eligible individuals with the state. But interagency relationships at local levels, Watts said, need to be protected.\n\n\"We've had a lot of success ... because of our ability to share data, and communicate in these ways, and problem-solve together,\" Watts said.",

    "title": "Newsom vs. Trump: What to know as California voters pick sides in a big political battle",
    "body": "Proposition 50 sparks debate over redistricting in California. It will play a substantial role in deciding which party controls the U.S. House.\n\nCalifornia voters on Nov. 4 will play a big role in deciding which party controls the U.S. House of Representatives for the final two years of President Donald Trump's time in office.\n\nCitizens of the nation's most populous state are weighing in on Proposition 50, a constitutional amendment pushed by Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom that would allow the state the chance to temporarily stop using a nonpartisan commission that draws their U.S. congressional district boundaries. Instead, California could use lines drawn by its Democratic state lawmakers in Sacramento that would increase their party's chances of winning more seats in Congress.\n\nBoth major political parties are rushing to redraw their congressional boundaries in at least a dozen states in an unprecedented push to determine which party will control the U.S. House after the 2026 midterm elections. Trump has pushed state lawmakers from Texas to Indiana to Missouri to redraw their maps to make them more favorable to the GOP in anticipation of historic trends in midterm elections that favor the opposition party that doesn't control the White House.\n\n\"What we have here - a redistricting to find additional seats for one party at the behest of the president - is really something quite novel,\" said Matthew Levendusky, a political science professor at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nSo how did we get here?\n\nRepublicans hold a razor-thin majority in the U.S. House and historically, the party that controls the White House fares poorly in midterm elections.\n\nDuring the 23 midterm elections since 1934, the president's party gained seats just three times, according to the American Presidency Project.\n\nIf Democrats take control of the House in the mid-terms, like when they won 40 new seats in the 2018 election during Trump's first term, it would likely mean congressional investigations, legislative paralysis - even possibly a third Trump impeachment.\n\nRepublicans keeping control of the House would allow the president to continue one of the most aggressive and disruptive agendas in modern presidential history.\n\nOver the summer, Trump began pushing state lawmakers in Texas, which has the largest Republican controlled delegation in the country, to redraw district lines to edge out some of the 12 Democrats who represent the state.\n\nAfter some drama - Democratic lawmakers fled the state - the Texas legislature approved new maps which created five new Republican-leaning congressional districts. The new lines face several federal lawsuits.\n\nCalifornia, which has the largest Democratic delegation in the country, responded by moving to redraw it's own districts, essentially cancelling out Texas' efforts.\n\nUnder Texas law, the state Legislature draws the Congressional district boundaries. But, under California's current Constitution, a nonpartisan commission draws the lines, so lawmakers have to get voter approval to change the constitution.\n\nCalifornia's Proposition 50 seeks to let the legislature redraw the state's congressional districts through 2030 to create five more seats favorable to Democrats. The map is already complete and public.\n\nAren't other states doing this?\n\nNormally, states redraw district boundaries after the U.S. Census occurs every ten years. Changes are generally only made between each census if someone challenges the boundaries in court and wins.\n\nAlong with Texas, Republicans have turned their new map into law in Missouri -- though voters may have the opportunity to reject the Show-Me State's changes in a special election. Ohio is also in the process of redistricting, and Republicans in North Carolina, Kansas, and Indiana are moving toward redrawing their maps.\n\nDemocratic leaders have joined the effort, pushing blue states to draw new lines to help their party too. Democratic-controlled legislatures in Illinois, New York, and Maryland have been considering moves, too, with varying degrees of interest among party leaders.\n\nIt's still too soon to know if more states will follow suit, but federal level officials in both parties continue to push their state level counterparts to act.\n\nAccording to the National Conference of State Legislatures, at least 11 states explicitly prohibit mid-decade redistricting, while other states explicitly allow it.\n\nWill the results be known election night?\n\nIf the margins are wide, Americans could know if Proposition 50 passed on election night.\n\nBut California has a history of taking a long time to count ballots, and voters tend to turn out in large numbers even for special elections (To be fair, there are 23 million registered voters there.)\n\nSo, if the margins are close, a final result could take weeks.\n\nProposition 50 seems poised to pass, favored by 20 points in an Emerson College poll taken Oct. 20-21.\n\nA statewide survey released Oct. 28 by the Public Policy Institute of California found that 56% of California likely voters said they would vote yes on the proposition. The survey also found that regardless of their position on the proposition, most voters said they believe the outcome is very important.\n\nThe survey also found that approval ratings for Trump in California remain low and that Californians identify political extremism or threats to democracy as the most important problem facing the nation.\n\n\"About nine in 10 likely voters say the outcome on the vote of Prop. 50 is at least somewhat important, including two in three who say it is very important,\" PPIC researcher Deja Thomas, said. \"Notably, we've not seen such a high level of importance placed on a ballot proposition since the survey began measuring this over 20 years ago.\"\n\nWhat does this mean politically?\n\nEvery seat counts in the 2026 midterms. Democrats currently need to gain just three seats to win control of the House.\n\nCalifornia's new boundaries could negate the new seats Republicans expects to win under Texas' new map. If Proposition 50 passes, there will likely be more pressure on other states to redraw their districts.\n\nBeyond 2026, Newsom has a lot riding politically on his bid to get the state's voters to agree to redraw its political maps as a way to push back on Trump, namely his potential 2028 presidential campaign.\n\nHe made his clearest comment yet about his future plans \"CBS News Sunday Morning\" Oct. 26, when he was asked whether he would give a presidential run serious thought after the midterms.\n\n\"Yeah,\" he said, adding that saying otherwise, \"I'd just be lying, and I can't do that.\"\n\nHow does the Supreme Court factor in?\n\nThe Supreme Court is currently weighing whether electoral districts can be created to protect the voting rights of minorities without discriminating against voters of other races.\n\nTheir decision could restrict a key provision of the landmark Voting Rights Act enacted 60 years ago that tries to keep legislative map drawers from diluting the votes of racial minorities by either packing them into one district or spreading them out among too many districts to have an impact.\n\nRepublican lawmakers in Louisiana, which the case is focused on, are considering legislation to push back the state's 2026 primary elections by a month. That could give lawmakers extra time to redraw the state's House district lines if the Supreme Court strikes down the current boundaries.\n\nOther states, particularly those with high Black populations, could join the redistricting fight depending on the Court's decision.\n\nIsn't redistricting normally about changes to a state's population?\n\nYes, redistricting is usually tied to the state's population.\n\nEvery 10 years a census of the nation's population is taken and the number of representatives each state has is rebalanced. Then, each state redraws the congressional and legislative boundaries to account for how their population has changed. For example, the 2020 census showed California's population had dropped and Texas' population Texas increased. That meant California got fewer members of Congress and Texas got more.\n\nBut, what is happening right now has nothing to do with population changes. There are still going to be the same number of congressional seats in each state.\n\nTexas, California and other states redrawing their boundaries right now are intentionally, and vocally, changing which citizens are in which districts so there is a greater chance of the state's majority party winning more seats in the U.S. Congress - and therefore whether Democrats or Republicans are in power for Trump's final two years as president.\n\nWhat does it mean for the future?\n\nPolitical experts like Levendusky are concerned that once the norm is broken for redrawing districts in the middle of a decade it could become a routinely-used political tool.\n\n\"Especially in a closely-divided House, this will up the pressure to continue to do this in the future, where both parties look to eke out the maximum gain from every state,\" he said. \"The losers are the voters in the political minority in a state who no longer get their voices heard by their elected officials.\"\n\nWhat do Californians think?\n\nUSA TODAY Network reporters spoke to Californians about a month before Election Day and found that many were frustrated, angry and wanting to push back against Trump or Newsom - from the rural, Republican North State to liberal enclaves along California's coast.\n\nWhat is this special election costing?\n\nProposition 50 is the only item on the ballot for this special election, which is expected to cost $282.6 million in taxpayer funds, according to the California Department of Finance.\n\nDemocrats have poured money into convincing voters to approve the initiative. It is already one of the most expensive ballot fights in state history.",

    "title": "White House hopefuls hit the 2025 campaign trail as Democrats try to turn the page",
    "body": "Former Vice President Kamala Harris and California Governor Gavin Newsom said they are considering 2028 presidential runs.\n\nWASHINGTON -- The Democrats' most recent presidential nominee is largely missing from the campaign trail one year after President Donald Trump delivered her party a thorough drubbing, opening the door for many others who are flirting with plans to compete against Kamala Harris in 2028 for the White House.\n\nHarris is currently on a book tour but does have her sights set on California, where on Saturday she'll be making her first in-person appearance in a 2025 race as voters in her home state decide whose side to take in a battle with Trump over redrawing congressional boundaries before the all-important 2026 midterms.\n\nBut neither Harris nor former President Joe Biden, who quit the Democratic ticket last year under political pressure, have campaigned in person for their party's nominees in the only gubernatorial races this year in Virginia and New Jersey.\n\nInstead, the Democratic Party is turning to a familiar force in those races during times of political crisis: former President Barack Obama, who has been featured in campaign ads in California and will headline rallies this weekend for Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey and Abigail Spanberger in Virginia.\n\nA number of politicians who've been tossed around as possible 2028 contenders have also dropped in on either or both states with governor races, often showcasing their resumes to distinguish themselves from a deep bench that wants to be part of the Democrats' rebuilding narrative.\n\n\"For many Democrats, they've turned the page,\" veteran Democratic strategist Jim Manley said. \"We as a party are desperate to try and look for leaders for the future. Unfortunately, we haven't found them yet.\"\n\nOn a Oct. 29 livestream for both of his party's candidates, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, who will lead the Democratic Governor's Association next year, immediately touted his electoral success as a two-term Democrat in a red state that Trump won decisively.\n\n\"I'm living, breathing proof that Democrats can and should win everywhere,\" Beshear said.\n\nOther top names were on the call, too, including Sens. Cory Booker, D-N.J., and Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., two former 2020 presidential contenders who touted the need for Democrats to score big victories and make this election an anti-Trump referendum.\n\n\"This is our chance to show that the MAGA world is not going to win when it comes to what the people want,\" Booker said during the Oct. 29 livestream.\n\nEven more have dropped by, such as Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, who stumped in Virginia, while former Biden Cabinet official Pete Buttigieg, Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., and former Japanese ambassador and Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel have done events in both states.\n\nKhanna and Emanuel have also campaigned in New York City, where 34-year-old Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani has excited progressives in his bid to be mayor of the nation's largest city. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., another possible 2028 contender, said Mamdani's candidacy represents a new hope for the city and nation.\n\nShe suggested voters are rallying behind the democratic socialist to take a stand against the Trump administration but also a \"bygone\" Democratic establishment embodied by former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, his opponent who is running for mayor as an independent.\n\n\"It is going to take all of us, but to be honest it always has,\" Ocasio-Cortez said. \"It is not a coincidence that the very forces that Zohran is up against in this race mirrors what we are up against nationally.\"\n\nTrump has referred to Mamdani as a \"communist\" and said it will be a \"fluke\" if the politician he's threatened with arrest is elected on Nov. 4. Still, Trump, a New York City native who has knocked the GOP candidate in the race, Curtis Sliwa, has not joined moderate Republicans in backing Cuomo.\n\nIn Virginia, Trump has kept Republican gubernatorial candidate Winsome Earle-Sears at arms length, even as he endorsed the state's attorney general, Jason Miyares, in his reelection bid. Miyares is facing off against Democrat Jay Jones. Trump and Vice President JD Vance have called on Jones to drop out of the race over violent text messages.\n\nTrump has lent Jack Ciatterelli his support in New Jersey, campaigning for the Republican virtually. But neither Trump nor Vance have made in-person campaign stops in the two states they lost handily to Democrats in 2024.\n\nBiden largely out of the 2025 picture\n\nBiden has been less active politically as the 82-year-old former president fights prostate cancer. He completed a course of radiation therapy in late October. But he has not been out of the public eye altogether.\n\nAs he accepted a life achievement award at the Edward M. Kennedy Institute in Boston on Oct. 27, Biden said the nation's \"democracy is at stake\" and declared \"it's no time to give up.\"\n\n\"These are dark days,\" Biden said. \"But we are one of the only countries in the world that has time and again has come out of every crisis we faced, stronger than we went into that crisis, every one.\"\n\nThe former president also plans to headline the Nebraska Democratic Party's annual gala on Nov. 7.\n\nA spokesperson for Biden had no comment.\n\nHarris is on a mostly-sold out book tour, promoting her campaign memoir, \"107 Days.\" But she has no tour dates on the calendar in the week leading up to Election Day. Her next stop is in Seattle on Nov. 4, which is the day of the election.\n\nIn her book, Harris took Biden's inner circle to task for refusing to tell the elderly president he should not seek reelection. She also revealed that former Obama White House staffer David Plouffe, a senior adviser on her 2024 campaign, pushed her to distance herself from Biden.\n\n\"People hate Joe Biden,\" she says Plouffe told her.\n\nOn the 2025 campaign trail, Harris' involvement has primarily been digital. She's sent fundraising emails for Spanberger and recorded robocalls for Sherrill.\n\nThe former Democratic 2024 presidential nominee endorsed the Proposition 50 campaign in California, where potential 2028 rival Gavin Newsom is spearheading the bid to combat Trump ahead of the 2026 midterm elections, in an Oct. 30 video, in which she accused Trump and the GOP of \"trying to rig the system around congressional maps.\" She's appearing on Saturday at a rally in California in support of the ballot initiative.\n\nHarris begrudgingly endorsed Mamdani in a television interview and made no appearances on the stump for any Democrat competing this fall. She recently held a closed-door fundraiser for former Democratic North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, who is competing in next year's election for the state's open Senate seat.\n\nA spokesperson for Spanberger's campaign did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nSherill did not directly answer a question from USA TODAY during an October editorial board meeting with the Bergen Record, a USA TODAY Network partner, when asked if she would welcome Harris on the trail. Sherill said her campaign makes invites based on who people ask to visit.\n\nThe four-term congresswoman, who is locked in a tight battle with Republican Jack Ciatterelli, said her constituents wanted to hear more about Maryland Gov. Wes Moore's anti-violence programs and Latino voters asked about Arizona Sen. Ruben Gallego.\n\n\"If people want to see (Harris) and ask for her at a certain rally, she is certainly someone that... a lot of people are invested in her book tour, and she still has that kind of draw,\" Sherill said.\n\n\"If that's the case, if people, you know, are requesting her, then we'll reach out.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Harris said that Spanberger and Sherill had invited her but it did not work with her schedule.\n\nHarris weighs her future\n\nHarris recently confirmed that she's considering another presidential bid.\n\n\"I am not done,\" she told the BBC in late October. \"I have lived my entire career as a life of service, and it's in my bones.\"\n\nBut early polling of the race suggests the party faithful are ready to move on. A University of New Hampshire survey of likely Democratic primary voters in October had Harris in fourth place in a prospective 2028 contest, behind Buttigieg, Newsom and Ocasio-Cortez, in that order.\n\nHarris had a 55% favorability rating in the poll, with 26% neutral, 17% unfavorable and almost no one undecided about their views on her.\n\nBy comparison, the most popular Democrat polled, Buttigieg, had an 81% approval rating, with 9% neutral, 6% negative and 4% still making up their minds. Newsom had a 58% approval rating, with 24% neutral, 10% opposed and 8% expressing uncertainty.\n\nMost primary voters in the early voting state were still forming their opinions about other potential candidates such as Beshear, Gallego, Khanna and Moore.\n\nOne prominent national Democrat, who asked to remain anonymous in order to speak candidly about the former president and vice president, pointed to the survey as evidence of the fading appeal of Harris. The party's most recent presidential nominee should not be trailing the pack a year after her history-making run, the person said.\n\nHarris can still help the party in targeted ways, the Democrat offered. But Biden is finished, the person said.\n\nThe Obama factor\n\nWith the party's most recent standard bearers largely out of the picture, Obama, the Democrats' most popular figure, has stepped in to fill the void.\n\nHe's cut ads for Sherill, Spanberger and Newsom's redistricting play in California. The ads in Virginia focus on the economy, voting rights and abortion access. The New Jersey spot hits on the economy and safety and reminds voters that Sherill is a former federal prosecutor, mother and Navy veteran.\n\nObama will campaign on Nov. 1 for Sherill in Newark and Spanberger in Norfolk on the final weekend of the campaign.\n\nIn announcing the appearance, Sherill said, \"President Obama reminds us what we can accomplish when we leaders are unafraid to take on big challenges to deliver.\"\n\nManley, the Democratic strategist and longtime Capitol Hill leadership aide, said it's \"about damn time\" Obama took on a more high-profile role in the current political debate.\n\nThe former president has been out of office for nearly nine years. Yet, he's still seen as Democrats' best hope for going toe-to-toe with Trump, who held a tele-rally for Ciattarelli to kick off early voting in New Jersey.\n\n\"He's still got his fastball,\" Manley said of Obama. \"And he's still wildly popular with the base, and no one gives a speech like him.\"\n\nVoters of Tomorrow executive director Santiago Mayer said Obama stirs up nostalgia for Gen Z on the campaign trail because he was the last person to serve as president before the hard-right shift in national politics.\n\n\"That will attract a lot of people who are excited to see that return to normalcy, see that excitement, see that energy, and really, the energy of change that Obama represented,\" Mayer said of his presence.\n\nThe 23-year-old liberal activist, whose group has been helping organize youth support for Spanberger and Sherill, said Gen Z voters still have a lot of affection for Harris. Her campaign was hampered by a double-digit swing in support from the demographic group to Trump, but Mayer said her backing from young people should not be underestimated.",

    "title": "Meet Newsom's answer to Trump's climate attacks",
    "body": "With help from Noah Baustin, Marc Heller, Ben Lefebvre and Jason Plautz\n\nIN THE SPOTLIGHT: After four years operating largely behind the scenes as Gov. Gavin Newsom's top climate adviser, Lauren Sanchez is now out front in the state's fight to defend its ambitious goals from an unrelenting Trump administration.\n\nSanchez was sworn in earlier this month as chair of the California Air Resources Board. She steps into the role at a crucial moment for the agency, as it tries to preserve its authority to regulate vehicle emissions standards and works to keep its climate ambitions intact as the federal government retreats from international goals -- all while developing regulations for critical programs like cap-and-trade.\n\nSanchez, who was a key negotiator for Newsom as the governor and state lawmakers hammered out a last-minute energy and gasoline affordability package at the end of the legislative session earlier this year, must now try to strike a delicate balance between efforts to reduce emissions without pushing California's already high cost-of-living higher.\n\nSanchez spoke to POLITICO about her time advising Newsom on climate policy, the state's role in countering the Trump administration and her top policy targets as CARB chair.\n\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nDo you talk with the governor about the politics of climate as an issue? And how do you calibrate how far to go and where not to go?\n\nHis north star on this issue continues to be our international leadership. He is in the business of ensuring that California is relevant in the future economy. If you look into the future 5-10 years, we're going to have a number of electro states, not petro states. It's said that China is already the first electro state. I think that the governor has seen things we have been able to do here in California, crises we have been able to respond to.\n\nI'll give you two examples. Coming into office with the Paradise fire and then doubling down on investments, on forest management, fire protection, and using AI for early fire protection. And then I turned to battery deployment. He came into office [with the state] at 770 megawatts [of battery storage]. The CARB scoping plan from 2017 did not envision a role for battery storage. We had the rolling blackouts of 2020, and the state's response to that is an enormous deployment of batteries, such that now we haven't even had a flex alert in the last three years. We're almost at, we're at 16 gigawatts of battery storage. And I'll tell you, when we travel the world, one of the questions the governor gets from developed economies that are hitting higher levels of renewable penetration is, \"How do you deal with intermittency?\" And we're able to point to the track record on battery storage.\n\nAs you reflect on this new role, how does it differ from working as an adviser to Newsom? Do you have a different constituency or different goals?\n\nI am held accountable by my appointing authority, the governor, and still remain close to him. I'm familiar with his priorities and what he's working on, but I'm one of 16 members on the California Air Resources Board. In my first few weeks here as chair, I have spent time getting to know each of them. A number of them are Governor appointees. Some are appointed by the legislature, and a big part of this job now is making sure that the board continues to guide this agency and staff in the direction of laying the track record for climate action and economic growth going hand in hand.\n\nI'll also say, distinctly different from my climate advisory role, is all of the work the board is doing on clean air and air quality. One of my first constituency meetings was visiting the San Joaquin Valley Air District, and their board and stakeholders are really focused on cleaning the air in the valley. I think a number of stakeholder relationships that I bring from my former job will continue to be really relevant to CARB's work, and continuing to work with the governor, the Legislature, who have given us a handful of legislative mandates that now we are again rolling up our sleeves to make sure we implement.\n\nAside from cap-and-trade, are there any other big-ticket items that you're anticipating bringing to the board next year?\n\nWe have two additional important pieces of legislation to bring to the board next year. SB 905, regarding carbon removal and our regulatory framework for that, which is a big part of how we're going to reach carbon neutrality. Sen. [Anna] Caballero's bill from our first climate package. And SB 253 and 261, around corporate disclosure. A lot of stakeholder interest in both of those. Those will be big items to bring to the board. Just next month, we are bringing the landfill methane regulation to the board. Methane is 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide; our best chance at staving off near-term warming is addressing methane.\n\nYou've previously said you were surprised by the effectiveness of the Trump administration at hampering California's policy goals. Why did that come as a surprise to you and California leaders when a lot of it was laid out in Project 2025?\n\nWe are familiar with the playbook they used in Trump 1.0. The state had over 100 lawsuits against the first Trump administration, over 70 related to climate and the environment. We were largely successful.\n\nWe saw, out of the gate, the federal administration deploy a variety of new tactics. You've seen the governor comment on the role of Congress and how that is significantly different in this administration. You've heard the governor comment on the role of corporations, law firms, universities. The environment is very different. So, I don't know that I credit the Trump administration for more sophistication so much as it's just a very different chessboard.\n\nThe governor has specifically called out General Motors CEO Mary Barra for her role in rolling back California's electric vehicle sales rules. What happened to anger him so much, and how close were you to landing deals with other companies?\n\nGeneral Motors, full stop, negotiated in bad faith and played both sides and continued to work with Congress. And I think 's important about where we are now, and me coming into this role as chair, is that we're moving forward. You saw the workshop that we hosted last week about what does the next era of regulations on clean cars look like in California. It is very much our intention to continue moving the next wave of regulations forward. We have gotten over 100 waivers from EPA, Democratic administrations, Republican administrations, and we plan to continue our long track record of technologically feasible, cost-effective standards that have borne the catalytic converter and the electric vehicle revolution you see transforming the world today.\n\nFour truck makers signed an agreement with the Trump administration saying they'll never work with California on another voluntary agreement. EPA is pushing back on CARB's attempt to bring back its 2012 light-duty vehicle emissions rules. Are all bets off at this point?\n\nThe federal government and U.S. EPA have abdicated their duty to protect Americans, in particular Californians. Millions of Californians suffer from breathing dirty air. More than 10 million Californians breathe unhealthy air, according to the U.S. EPA, 1,500 Californians die prematurely from air pollution every year in Southern California alone. We have a federal administration that is denying climate science, that is letting polluters off the hook with an email exemption that is undermining their own ability to take on these regulations, and they will stop at nothing in attacking Californians. My response to them, and you've heard this from the Governor, is California will not back down. You saw the lawsuit on Monday.

But Ellen Stuart-Haëntjens, executive director of the Virginia Wilderness Committee, said that the \"emergency\" designation is so broad that it could encompass projects that have more to do with harvesting timber than preventing wildfires.\n\n\"This administration is redefining what we call an emergency,\" Haentjens said.\n\nCalifornia Sen. Alex Padilla is one of the bill's main Democratic sponsors in the Senate. He believes that the legislation would protect some of the National Environmental Policy Act regulations that the Trump administration is looking to change, aides to the senator said. That includes ensuring public involvement as projects are proposed, they said.\n\nSen. Adam Schiff, meanwhile, has opposed the measure.\n\nTheir division mirrors one among environmental advocates: the Environmental Defense Fund and the National Wildlife Federation are in favor, while the Center for Biological Diversity and Earthjustice are firmly opposed.\n\nThe bill advanced out of the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee with bipartisan support earlier this month. The House passed a similar bill earlier this year. -- MH, NB\n\nCEQA DEFENSE: After a legislative session in which lawmakers chipped away at environmental rules for construction projects, the Assembly's Natural Resources chair wants lawmakers to strike a better balance.\n\nAsked about the biggest hurdles lawmakers face going into next year, Assemblymember Isaac Bryan told attendees to a webinar Thursday that the California Environmental Quality Act -- the law often blamed for slowing down housing and energy projects -- is \"still under attack.\"\n\n\"CEQA, at times, has been abused and misused,\" Bryan said. \"But that doesn't mean the idea of looking through a healthy and thoughtful, long-term criteria for what this kind of building would do to our environment isn't important.\"\n\nBryan's appearance on the webinar hosted by the Climate Center came a little over a week after the California Chamber of Commerce filed a ballot initiative to further streamline CEQA and limit lawsuits against affordable housing, clean energy and other projects deemed \"essential.\" -- AN\n\nNOT YOU, CALIFORNIA: Widespread opposition to new offshore drilling has pressured the Trump administration to back off plans to open the waters off the coasts of many states. California isn't one of them.\n\nThe Interior Department has removed the federal waters off the Atlantic coast from its offshore drilling plan in the face of Republican pressure, but still plans to propose allowing new oil and gas leases off the California coast, reports POLITICO's Ben Lefebvre. The plan's latest iteration will also include a portion of the eastern Gulf of Mexico but provide a buffer around Florida, a Republican stronghold long opposed to drilling, three people familiar with the latest moves told POLITICO.\n\nThe Interior Department is expected to propose the new plan soon, the people said. It could change before its final publication, and will go through a review process before becoming public.\n\nA White House spokesperson declined to discuss ongoing policy deliberations, and an Interior spokesperson did not respond to questions.\n\nCalifornia political leaders have come out in sharp opposition to the possibility of new oil and gas leases opening off their shore. -- BL, NB\n\nBUILD IT FIRST: Forget concerns of an artificial intelligence bubble: West Coast tech titans are all in on data center growth, and the electricity grid upgrades needed to fuel it, reports Jason Plautz for POLITICO's E&E News.\n\nIf the nation's internet giants overestimate the coming demand for data centers, Americans could end up footing the outsized electricity bills for new energy infrastructure built to meetr demand that never materialized.\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg didn't appear to be concerned during the company's Wednesday earnings call. He thinks the right strategy is to \"aggressively front-load building capacity\" -- though he acknowledged that it's \"of course possible to overshoot.\"\n\nWorst case, he said, is \"we effectively have just prebuilt for a couple of years ... but we'd grow into that and use it over time.\"\n\nMicrosoft Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood said during her company's earnings call Wednesday that she has \"very high\" confidence that all the data centers will be needed. Executives from Amazon and Alphabet, Google's parent company, expressed similar confidence in moving forward with data center construction.\n\nThose decisions are having ripple effects across the country. American Electric Power -- a utility spanning parts of 11 states -- increased its five-year capital spending plan by nearly 30 percent in order to meet data center needs. -- JP, NB\n\n-- An oceanic heat wave caused by climate change is threatening marine life.\n\n-- A hydrogen policy expert urges the hydrogen industry to focus less on renewable zeal and more on affordability in the wake of funding cuts.\n\n-- Los Angeles is on its way to transforming wastewater into drinking water for 500,000 people.",

    "title": "California ensures undocumented residents access to phone service assistance. A US senator wants Trump administration to investigate",
    "body": "Gov. Gavin Newsom earlier this month signed a bill that ensures undocumented California residents can access a state program that provides discounted home and cell phone services -- and protects their information.\n\nThose updates to the California Lifeline Program have gotten the attention of U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, who has asked the Trump administration to investigate whether it \"undermines federal law, encourages unlawful entry and misuses taxpayer dollars.\"\n\nCalifornia Lifeline provides discounted home or cell phone services to eligible households. Eligibility is determined based on a household's total annual gross income or enrollment in other public assistance programs, including Medi-Cal, Section 8 housing, SNAP, WIC and more. Households have to choose either home or cell phone services, not both.\n\nThe application form asked for a Social Security number, which caused confusion about whether households with undocumented residents could apply, said Assemblymember Avelino Valencia, an Anaheim Democrat who spearheaded the changes in the state legislature.\n\nAccording to a bill analysis, the federal Lifeline program began requiring Social Security numbers in 2012, and California's program also began to collect them at that time \"to maximize the federal support available to California subscribers.\"\n\nValencia's bill, which passed along party lines before Newsom signed it in early October, specified that a Social Security number is not required to apply for the program.\n\nAnd it also explicitly prohibits the California Public Utilities Commission, which administers the program, from sharing applicants' information with other government entities without a court subpoena or warrant.\n\nThe idea, supporters said, is to protect undocumented residents' information from being shared with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement or other federal immigration authorities amid the Trump administration's immigration crackdown.\n\nThe updates to the program \"will help increase participation for eligible undocumented Californians and ensures they can access essential communication services without fear of unnecessary government overreach,\" Valencia said.\n\nBut Cruz, a former Republican presidential contender, alleged in a letter to U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi that the changes \"likely violates federal law.\" He called it \"the latest in a series of measures by Democrat-run jurisdictions that not only incentivize illegal entry into the United States but also obstruct the lawful operations of federal immigration authorities.\"\n\nCruz asked Bondi and Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr to investigate and \"ensure the California law complies with federal law in order to restore transparency and ensure taxpayer dollars are not misused to subsidize and encourage illegal immigration,\" according to a news release.\n\nCalifornia Lifeline is funded by a surcharge billed and collected by telecommunications carriers.\n\nCruz, in his letter to Bondi, asked for her to review the bill \"and take all actions necessary to uphold our country's immigration laws.\"\n\nAnd he asked Carr to provide \"an assessment of whether state-level telecommunication programs that give benefits to illegal aliens are duplicative of federal benefits and should therefore result in those federal benefits being reduced or eliminated.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the Justice Department confirmed receipt of Cruz's letter but declined to comment further.\n\nRepresentatives for the FCC could not immediately be reached for comment. Both offices noted that communications with the media are limited during the ongoing federal government shutdown.\n\nIn response to Cruz's letters to Trump administration officials, Valencia said the updates to California's program do not impact the separate, federal Lifeline Program.\n\n\"California's Lifeline Program has existed for decades to help low-income residents, including seniors, students and working families, afford basic phone service,\" Valencia said. \"It is a communications safety net, not a giveaway.\"\n\n\"The law does not rely on state taxpayer dollars and ensures that low-income residents, including survivors of domestic violence, can access essential phone service,\" Valencia continued, adding that his bill \"also reiterates fundamental legal principles requiring state entities to obtain a warrant before releasing private customer data to any law enforcement agency.\"\n\n\"Access to communication is not a partisan issue. It is a public safety issue, an education issue and an economic issue,\" he said. \"People need to be able to call 911 and reach critical services regardless of shifting federal immigration rules.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Newsom's office said the bill is just standard practice to protect people's information from inappropriate disclosure.\n\n\"This bill is part of California's nation-leading efforts to protect individuals' personal information,\" said Diana Crofts-Pelayo, a spokesperson for Newsom. \"We will continue to fight for privacy and consumer protections to ensure personal information is not misused by any organization or against any individual.\"\n\nA bill analysis noted California is able to establish its own rules for the state program that differ from the federal program, albeit California is not able to change federal eligibility requirements set by the FCC for the federal program.\n\nIt also noted that federal Lifeline subsidies account for $100 million to $150 million annually for California subscribers. \"To the extent that this bill enables a larger number of Californians to enroll in and renew participation in Lifeline without (Social Security numbers), this bill may increase the state's reliance on state-level ratepayer revenues to cover any lost federal subsidies,\" it said.\n\nOf note, the Orange County registrar of voters is also at odds with the federal government over the sharing of people's personal information.\n\nThe Justice Department sued Registrar of Voters Bob Page in June for allegedly not providing full records related to the removal of non-citizens from voter registration lists.\n\nPage, county attorneys said, would have violated state and federal law if he had turned over sensitive personal information of voter registrants without a subpoena or court order. Correspondence between representatives for the Justice Department and legal counsel for the registrar's office showed there was an effort made by the registrar to provide the \"sensitive information,\" just in a manner that would include \"assurances that such sensitive personal identifiers will remain confidential and be used for government purposes only.\"",

We won't have an election that's fair and free if we don't stand up,\" Newsom told ABC News Thursday, adding Trump wants a \"Putin election.\"\n\nReacting to Newsom's comments, Griffin said, \"I think it is wholly irresponsible for the governor of the most populous state, who, by the way, oversees elections in his own state. He oversees the cybersecurity infrastructure. He oversees the secretary of state. Down to poll watchers, to election workers, Gavin Newsom has a lot of power in this.\n\n\"He could, at a minimum, say, 'I can promise you, California will have a free and fair election, and I'll work with every governor to make sure that there's no efforts to undermine them.' But that's not what he's doing,\" she added.\n\nCo-host Sunny Hostin challenged Griffin's argument, asking how Newsom could assure voters of election integrity while the president plans to send federal election monitors to California.\n\n\"Because he's the chief executive of the state,\" Griffin responded. \"Monitors, we need to know what that means. I do think it's an alarming phrase.\"\n\nBefore she could finish her point, co-host Joy Behar interrupted and asked, \"Doesn't it sound like election intimidators?\"\n\nGriffin noted that Newsom has \"his own authorities in the state\" and drew a parallel between his stance on election monitors and his efforts to redistrict California.\n\n\"For him to say this, it reminds me very much of the gerrymandering debate,\" she recalled. \"So, everyone is angry when Texas redraws congressional maps to add more Republican seats.

    "body": "(Bloomberg) -- California Governor Gavin Newsom is betting his political future on a controversial ballot measure that would redraw the state's congressional maps to favor Democrats. A coalition of super wealthy and working people is giving him a big financial advantage.\n\nOver the past 11 weeks, Newsom and his allies brought in more than $120 million for Proposition 50, about three times the total raised by the proposal's opponents. The governor's backers include billionaires George Soros, Michael Moritz and Reed Hastings, as well as the state's influential nurses, teachers and public employee unions and an army of small donors.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nA flood of contributions \"broke the seal\" and helped dispel initial concerns over donor fatigue after Kamala Harris' 2024 presidential loss and worries that Newsom supporters would hold back because of the potential for White House retribution, said campaign consultant Juan Rodriguez. The campaign also got a big boost from House Majority PAC, which is supporting Democrats nationwide.\n\nThe lopsided haul has enabled the governor to blitz the airwaves ahead of the Nov. 4 vote on the ballot measure, an initiative that has propelled his rise to become a top Democratic antagonist of President Donald Trump. Newsom, a potential presidential contender in 2028, has championed Proposition 50 as a way to neutralize a move by Texas Republicans to grab as many as five extra seats in the US House of Representatives in next year's midterm elections.\n\nThe spending spree appears to be having an impact. An Emerson College poll of likely voters conducted last week found increasing favorability for the redistricting measure at 57%. That was comparable to the 56% support in a survey by the Public Policy Institute of California.\n\nA poll released Thursday from the Institute of Governmental Studies at the University of California, Berkeley, showed that 60% of likely voters backed the proposal, compared with 48% of registered voters surveyed in August.\n\n\"Certain demographic groups that were hesitant to support the measure last month have come around to support Prop. 50, such as Black voters, whose support increased from 45% to 71%,\" Spencer Kimball, executive director of Emerson College Polling, said in a statement.\n\nNewsom is asking voters to temporarily override a hard-won independent commission that draws California's congressional district maps in favor of a partisan revamp designed to flip five Republican-held seats to Democrats - and improve the odds of a Democratic takeover of the House.",

    "title": "California Lowers Cannabis Excise Tax But Is It A Win?",
    "body": "Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights.\n\nIn September 2025, California Governor Gavin Newsom signed Assembly Bill 564 (AB 564) into law, reducing the state's cannabis excise tax from 19% to 15%. The change will take effect on January 1, 2026, and will remain in place through 2029 unless modified through future legislation.\n\nThe bill was authored by Assemblymember Matt Haney (D-San Francisco) and follows years of concern from legal cannabis operators about pricing, competition from the illicit market, and unsustainable challenges in the state's regulatory framework.\n\nOnly time will determine whether or not this is a significant win for the industry. Most industry insiders feel more needs to be done to fix the legal market in California. Without further reforms, more companies may go into receivership and/or enter bankruptcy in California. When elected officials use the word \"collapse\" and regulators cite the need to \"stabilize\" the market, it's probably a sign that the legal market is in trouble.\n\nCalifornia's cannabis excise tax was originally set at 15% in 2016 under Proposition 64, which legalized weed for adults 21 and over. A volume based cultivation tax was also imposed at the time of adult use legalization.\n\nIn 2022, the cultivation tax was eliminated as part of a policy change within Assembly Bill 195 (AB 195) designed to help struggling cannabis farmers.\n\nThe state also shifted the point of excise tax collection from licensed distributors to retailers. As part of the stipulations for AB 195, and to ensure consistent tax revenue after the elimination of the cultivation tax, the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration (CDTFA) raised the effective rate to 19% on July 1st of this year.\n\nNow AB 564 eliminates that 4 point adjustment, restoring the tax rate to 15% on January 1, 2026. The measure also includes provisions requiring the Department of Finance and CDTFA to issue biennial reports assessing the tax's impact on compliance levels, market performance, and state revenues.\n\nIn a press release, Assemblymember Haney emphasized the practical purpose of the reform.\n\n\"The legal cannabis industry in California is collapsing under the weight of illegal competition and overtaxation,\" said Haney. \"AB 564 helps give licensed businesses a fair shot by reducing a tax that has become an obstacle to compliance and survival.\"\n\nHe explained that while some state revenue loss is expected short term, stabilizing the legal industry could strengthen overall tax collection long-term and protect the integrity of California's cannabis regulations.\n\nThe cannabis industry has universally supported the bill. Caren Woodson, executive director of the California Cannabis Industry Association (CCIA), underscored the importance of the excise tax reduction in a statement issued shortly after the bill was signed.\n\n\"Lowering the excise tax from 19% to 15% is a targeted, evidence-based response to the market instability we've been hearing about for years,\" said Woodson. \"It sends a clear signal that California is committed to supporting a functional, sustainable cannabis economy.\"\n\nRetail operators have long contended that high pricing drives consumers to unlicensed sellers, further undermining the efforts of tax-compliant businesses.\n\n\"Reducing the excise tax moves us closer to price parity,\" said Jerred Kiloh, president of the United Cannabis Business Association (UCBA). \"That's essential if policymakers really want to bring consumers back into legal shops.\"\n\nSome social equity advocates have framed the move as only a partial step toward improving the legal market. Many equity applicants and operators work on thin margins and face steep local taxes and regulatory fees in addition to state-level tax obligations.\n\nAmber Senter, co-founder of Supernova Women, commented in MJBizDaily that \"lowering the excise tax is a step in the right direction for equity operators, but the state must also continue to address access to capital, permitting delays, and local license caps.\"\n\nVince Ning, CEO and founder of Nabis cannabis distribution company -- the state's largest -- also felt more needs to be done.\n\n\"This is a positive step forward, but it's just one piece of the puzzle,\" said Ning. \"In some jurisdictions, consumers face cumulative tax rates approaching 50% on legal cannabis -- conditions that fuel illicit sales and undermine licensed businesses.\"\n\nAs Ning indicates, local jurisdictions can place their own cannabis tax under Proposition 64. In some areas, that tax can be as high as 10% or more. This gets placed on top of the excise tax. Cannabis products are also subject to state sales tax which hovers near 10% in many jurisdictions across the state.\n\nFor example, if a joint of cannabis costs $10, a 15% excise tax takes that to $11.50 and another 10% of local taxes (as in Los Angeles) hikes it to $12.50. Add a 10% sales tax on top of that and now that joint costs $13.50. If a consumer decides to buy 10 of those joints, that consumer is now paying $35 in total taxes.\n\nIndustry players have complained for years that this cumulative taxation drives cannabis consumers to the underground market. The data suggests they may be correct. Even by the Department of Cannabis Controls (DCC) own estimates, the underground market still has about 60% market share in California.\n\nThe DCC and CDTFA are now responsible for implementing the new rate and will monitor its effects over a four-year period. DCC Director Nicole Elliott offered a measured view on the bill.\n\n\"This adjustment will not solve every challenge, but aligns with broader efforts to stabilize the legal market,\" said Elliot. \"We continue to prioritize enforcement, public health, and equitable access to resources within the regulated system.\"\n\nWhenever taxes are lowered in a high-tax state like California, it's a win for operators and consumers. The question remains, is it enough? AB 195 and AB 564 took years for advocates and industry lobbyists to get over the finish line.\n\nOther industries like alcohol, tobacco, and firearms have lower excise taxes than cannabis. Firearms are taxed at 11% and alcohol is taxed by volume not by gross sales. This makes the tax on a glass of wine about a penny. On a pure scientific basis, those products are more harmful to human health than cannabis, which may indicate something is out of balance with excise taxes for weed in California.\n\nMany retailers I know are already in debt to the CDTFA on their excise taxes. In many jurisdictions in California, a large amount is owed in local cannabis taxes that cannot be collected ($400 Million in the city of LA alone). The overall sales in the legal market continue to fall in California every year for the last several years. And only 20% of all cannabis companies in the United States are profitable, according to economist Beau Whitney.\n\nWhile AB 564 may be a win for the industry, many operators feel it's more symbolic than significant. Maybe AB 564 will bring customers back into the shops. Maybe this is all that needs to be done. As I've written before, only time will tell and the clock is ticking on the legal cannabis market in California.",

    "body": "The California governor also reacted to a comedian referring to him as a \"literal comic book villain.\"\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) doesn't appear to be a fan of social media users likening him to The Wall Street businessman-turned-serial killer, Patrick Bateman, from the 2000 film \"American Psycho.\"\n\nIn an awkward exchange during a Wednesday interview with ABC News' Jonathan Karl, the journalist suddenly brought up the comparison amid their wide-ranging conversation.\n\n\"What do you make of all the Patrick Bateman talk?\" Karl blurted out.\n\n\"I don't know, but -- \" Newsom began with a seemingly nervous laugh.\n\nKarl then held up printed pages of memes depicting Newsom as the fictitious character, who was played by Christian Bale, telling the politician, \"People say that you are like 'American Psycho.'\"\n\n\"Jesus, yeah, like I said, 'Newscum,' I mean -- \" a flustered Newsom responded, referring to President Donald Trump's nickname for him.\n\n\"But even your friends, like, say that,\" Karl added.\n\nVisibly caught off guard, the California governor then questioned, \"Oh, do they?\" before teasing, \"I'm gonna reevaluate my guest list.\"\n\nAdding fuel to the fire, Karl then read aloud a line from an unnamed comedian who apparently called Newsom \"a literal comic book villain from central casting\" who has \"Patrick Bateman vibes.\"\n\n\"He definitely had someone killed or may have killed someone himself,\" Karl added of the comedian's remarks about Newsom, prompting the politician to chuckle.\n\nQuipping that he's \"glad\" to \"still have some humor left,\" Newsom then took on a graver tone, telling Karl, \"This is a rough business. Particularly if you're willing to fight. And I just hope we have more fighters.\"\n\nHe added, \"I have no problem being out there with the arrows in my back, as long as it gives some space for people to run over me and move forward.\"\n\nElsewhere in the interview, the topic of Bateman arose again after Karl asked Newsom what the biggest misconception about him was.\n\n\"I don't know about the misconception. I think some of this, you know, some of the Bateman, the looks, you know, the whole thing, right?\" Newsom said, gesturing to the printed memes. \"The hair, all that, you know, and so I think people then see that [and] believe certain things.\"\n\nSeeking clarification, Karl asked if he was referring to people believing he's a \"lightweight.\"\n\n\"Is that what you're saying?\" he questioned.\n\n\"I think they think [I have] just a little more style versus the substance. I put the substance in terms of policy making up against ... and I mean that, that's not braggadocious ... I'm really proud of the policy work we've done.\"",

    "title": "Gov. Gavin Newsom Turns California Election Into Possible 2028 Platform",
    "body": "In Iowa, a retired math teacher clicked a link in a text message and donated $35. A school secretary in Las Vegas pitched in $50. An interior designer in Pennsylvania, an insurance agent in Chicago and a ski instructor in New Hampshire each gave $100.\n\nTheir small donations all went to California to help Gov. Gavin Newsom try to flip five congressional seats for Democrats.\n\n\"I'm so disenchanted with the direction of this country today that I have to support the people that are standing up for democracy,\" said Amy Kaufman, the ski instructor. \"And Gavin Newsom is one of them.\"\n\nResponding to email and text message appeals, small donors from across the country gave Mr. Newsom a combined $38 million for a ballot measure intended to stop President Trump and Republicans from retaining complete control of the federal government in 2026.\n\nNearly half of donors who cumulatively gave at least $100 came from outside of California. In multiple interviews, these donors said they gave to Mr. Newsom because they saw him as one of the few Democrats fighting Republicans on their own terms. After President Trump asked leaders in Texas and other red states to pursue rare, mid-decade gerrymandering to offset potential midterm losses for Republicans, California is the closest of any Democrat-led state to striking back so far.\n\nPolls suggest that California voters are very likely to pass Mr. Newsom's redistricting measure on Tuesday, a win that could serve as the ultimate foundation for a 2028 presidential run that he is considering. If he runs, he could tell voters that he directly fought back against Mr. Trump in the midterms.\n\nAnd he would emerge with a national list of donors and supporters that few other Democratic hopefuls have at the moment.\n\nThe list began more than 25 years ago, when Mr. Newsom was a wine entrepreneur just getting his footing as a politician. Mr. Newsom said in an interview that he started building an email list of donors when he was on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors and wanted to gather support for a bond measure to fund parks.\n\n\"I started going, 'Oh, emails, that's interesting and novel,\" he recalled. \"'I should use these.'\"\n\nFrom there, he took a methodical approach to building his list, gathering more names and emails every time he ran for another office or put an initiative on the ballot. The list includes names that Mr. Newsom has collected organically, as well as those in databases he has purchased.\n\nThe project accelerated in 2021 when Republicans tried to recall Mr. Newsom and he reached out to Democrats across the country for support. Then, in 2023, Mr. Newsom created a political action committee to support Democrats in Republican-controlled states -- giving him a reason to collect more names and emails from beyond California.\n\nBuilding the list had become a discipline. Mr. Newsom called the list \"huge\" but declined to say an exact number. He now calls the list \"the most valuable asset\" of his political career.\n\n\"It's a very deliberative investment,\" Mr. Newsom said. \"It's a lot of resources. It's a lot of time and a lot of iteration.\"\n\nAlong the way, Mr. Newsom picked up contact info for Steven Lamansky, a retired high school math teacher in Ankeny, Iowa, just north of Des Moines. Mr. Lamansky sent his first $35 donation to the Proposition 50 campaign on Aug. 10 after receiving a text message pitch from Mr. Newsom's campaign. Two weeks later, he sent another $35. The next month, $35 more.\n\nMr. Lamansky, 77, said he donated because he wanted to counter gerrymandering in Republican-led states and help Democrats to take back the House next year. But he also pitched in specifically to boost Mr. Newsom.\n\n\"I find him a very dynamic person,\" Mr. Lamansky said. \"Every time I've heard him on different shows, he's really got his ducks in a row. He knows his facts. I really like him, and I'd like to see him run for president.\"\n\nMr. Newsom has curated his national image, just as he has his supporter list. He has gone on Fox News to attack Republicans, including a face-off with Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida in 2023 that was billed as \"The Great Red vs. Blue State Debate.\" He started the podcast \"This Is Gavin Newsom\" this year, turning heads when he asked conservatives like Charlie Kirk and Steve Bannon why the Democrats failed in 2024.\n\nAfter Mr. Trump sent National Guard troops to Southern California in June during immigration raids and protests, Mr. Newsom returned to his place as a chief antagonist of the Republican president. One night, with troops in Los Angeles, he gave a speech on national television warning Americans that \"democracy is under assault right before our eyes.\"\n\nThis summer, Mr. Newsom used a more experimental communication strategy. With help from his young staff, Mr. Newsom adopted an aggressively satirical voice mocking Mr. Trump on social media. And he began appearing on platforms that cater to young, male audiences -- a cohort that Democrats lost ground with in last year's election.\n\nBetween banter about sports and video games, the governor has slipped in pleas for his redistricting measure into the \"All the Smoke\" podcast, which is hosted by two retired N.B.A. players, and a livestreamed game of Fortnite with a Twitch streamer known as ConnorEatsPants.\n\nRepublicans have struggled to counter Mr. Newsom on Proposition 50, in part because of the governor's fund-raising prowess, but also because he was so effective in making the race a referendum on Mr. Trump in a Democratic state. They lacked a central figure or message around which to build a groundswell of opposition.\n\nRepresentative Kevin Kiley, a California Republican who would become immediately vulnerable if Proposition 50 passes, has spent years challenging Mr. Newsom, including during the 2023 recall when he ran as a candidate for governor.\n\nMr. Kiley has been a lonely voice in Washington calling for a national prohibition on mid-decade redistricting. He said the ballot measure seemed to be serving as a \"launching pad\" for Mr. Newsom's 2028 aspirations.\n\n\"His entire governorship,\" Mr. Kiley said, \"he has treated as a warm-up to running for president.\"\n\nMr. Newsom's efforts have resonated with Democratic voters beyond California, as he has climbed to the top of several Democratic presidential primary polls in the months since he began the redistricting campaign.\n\nIt is, of course, too early to anoint any contender, let alone Mr. Newsom. The California governor could struggle in many states to overcome his reputation as a liberal coastal elite, an image that Democrats are desperately trying to shed at the moment.\n\nThough Mr. Newsom is getting a lot of traction with the Democratic activist base, it does not mean he will win a primary three years from now, said Mike Murphy, a former adviser to Republican presidential candidates who supported Joseph R. Biden Jr. in 2020 and Kamala Harris last year instead of Mr. Trump.\n\n\"He's got a flashy thing of the moment,\" Mr. Murphy said. \"In the 100 steps to the nomination, it doesn't hurt him. I just think you can overrate it.\"\n\nMatt Bennett, a Democratic strategist who worked on campaigns for former President Bill Clinton, said that Mr. Newsom may also have a hard time running a presidential campaign because of a perception nationally that California is a troubled state.\n\n\"What he can do is run on his aggressive efforts to take on Trump and MAGA in various ways,\" Mr. Bennett said, adding that the redistricting measure would be \"the most important and prominent of them.\"\n\nSteven Rich contributed data analysis, and Shane Goldmacher contributed reporting.",

    "title": "Republicans fight Newsom's $88M redistricting 'power grab' as Prop 50 battle heats up",
    "body": "Former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger said Gov. Gavin Newsom's claim that his redistricting plan would be temporary \"total fantasy\" during a CNN interview.\n\nThe Congressional Leadership Fund (CLF), a key fundraising arm of House Republican leadership, has spent $13 million to stop the California redistricting measure led by the state's Democrat governor, Gavin Newsom, falling well short of the waves of cash in support of the measure.\n\nThat doesn't mean Republicans have given up hope that voters may still reject Proposition 50.\n\nRep. Vince Fong, R-Calif., is one of the many Republicans who could face steeper election odds in 2026 if voters approve the new congressional maps up for consideration.\n\n\"I appreciate CLF stepping up to help us fight back against Newsom and his progressive puppets who have made it their mission to strip voter protections from our state constitution,\" Fong said when asked whether $13 million would be enough to persuade voters.\n\nOBAMA ENDORSES NEWSOM CALIFORNIA REDISTRICTING PROP 50\n\n\"Fair representation is on the ballot. We continue to do everything we can to get out the vote and stop Newsom's power grab that will silence the voice of Californians,\" he said.\n\nVoters will consider Proposition 50 on Nov. 4.\n\nThe California Secretary of State's reporting on campaign finance reveals that the CLF has made three transfers since Newsom approved proposition 50 on Aug 21.\n\nCLF paid out $5 million on Sept. 5 in opposition messaging. The committee made two more donations: $5 million on Oct. 3 and another $3 million on Oct. 14 -- both to the California Republican Party.\n\n\"Congressional Leadership Fund spent $13 million in California to protect our members from a corrupt, power-hungry Democrat supermajority,\" CLF spokeswoman Torunn Sinclair said of those transfers. \"Californians should vote NO on Prop 50 because the last thing corrupt California Democrats need is even more power.\"\n\nNORTHERN CALIFORNIA VOTERS WEIGH IN ON PROP 50 REDISTRICTING FIGHT\n\nDespite the CLF's support, supporters of Proposition 50 have vastly outspent its opposition. According to the California Secretary of State, Newsom's \"Yes on 50\" fundraising vehicle has accumulated over $88 million on its own.\n\nNewsom has repeatedly framed his efforts as a necessary rebuttal to similar Republican-led redistricting efforts in Texas.\n\nIf successful, Proposition 50 would temporarily amend the California constitution, circumvent state prohibitions on gerrymandering and implement a new set of constituency maps that draw a red line through several Republican-held congressional districts.\n\nBy selectively spreading their districts to areas that have historically voted for Democrats, Proposition 50 aims to dilute Republican electoral power. Because of razor-thin margins in the House of Representatives, even one or two more seats for either party could decide the balance of power in the lower chamber of Congress and, by extension, in Washington, D.C.\n\nVOTING UNDERWAY IN 2025 ELECTION THAT MAY DETERMINE IF REPUBLICANS HOLD HOUSE IN 2026 MIDTERMS\n\nFindings by the Public Policy Institute of California show that a majority of voters say they would vote yes on Nov 4. In research released on Wednesday, the institute's polling shows that 56% of respondents said they would likely vote to support it compared with just 43% of voters who said they would likely vote no.\n\nDespite the high-stakes contest and a lopsided funding picture, a strategist familiar with the thinking of California Republicans believes that some nuances at play reduce the proposition's likelihood. They pointed out the measure itself may not be an automatic yes for many voters.\n\n\"With mail-in ballots, 'no' has a built-in advantage,\" the source said, noting that a wide range of California's voters use mail to participate in elections.\n\nThey explained that voters reading a description of the measure with only superficial understanding of what it does may fill out the \"no\" option if they're unsure about what to put down.\n\nThe source also pointed out that California also approved a constitutional amendment in place in 2008 that prohibited gerrymandering, noting that Californians who have voted for that measure might find themselves reluctant to undo their own votes now.\n\nThat's the case that Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., believes Republicans can make to voters in the closing days of the campaign. Like Fong, Isaa's district could also change with the adoption of Proposition 50.\n\n\"We've made a strong, consistent and statewide case that Prop. 50 is an unprecedented power grab that shouldn't pass the test of millions of voters who already chose to prevent just this kind of gerrymandering,\" Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"Not a day goes by in the 48th District that I don't hear from a constituent opposed to being denied the representation they chose, and I'll fight as long as it takes for the people's right to choose their representatives -- not the other way around.\"\n\nAccording to findings by Political Data Inc., 4.4 million voters have already cast a vote through mail-in voting.\n\nNewsom's office did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.",

    "title": "This is candidate self-destruction season",
    "body": "For California politicians who fancy themselves as the state's next governor, this fall has become an unprecedented season of self-destruction.\n\nThe field aiming to succeed Gavin Newsom is the most crowded in modern memory. So far, the open seat with no obvious successor has drawn the likes of former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, former state Assemblyman Ian Calderon, former state Controller Betty Yee, former Orange County Congresswoman Katie Porter, former Fox News commentator Steve Hilton, former state Attorney General Xavior Becerra, state Schools Supt. Tony Thurmond and Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco.\n\nWaiting in the wings: Democratic U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla, who surveys indicate would become the favorite if he declares for the office.\n\nFor awhile, the polling leader was former Vice President Kamala Harris, the ex-U.S. Senator who dropped out after months of considering a run. She was the first candidate to self-destruct, when her September book belittled and griped about major national Democratic figures like Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, Newsom and even her vice presidential pick, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.\n\nHarris removed herself from the run for governor, but her book might take her out of the 2028 presidential campaign, too, having established her as a first-rate whiner.\n\nSoon after, Porter - the early leader in most gubernatorial polls - was videotaped snapping at a CBS News reporter who asked tough questions and threatening to end their interview. Another tape quickly emerged revealing her as a screaming boss reaming out an aide. Her behavior forced her to apologize, and will hurt her poll standing.\n\nThese episodes revealed two inept politicos harming themselves, but the episodes cannot match the incompetence demonstrated by current poll leader Hilton.\n\nHis campaign office sent out a press release one day after Newsom in late October shut down the I-5 freeway, the high-speed coastal road for 19 miles between San Onofre and Oceanside.\n\nThe reason was a celebration of the Marine Corps' upcoming 250th anniversary featuring Vice President JD Vance. It featured live artillery fire over the freeway. Despite assurances from the Marines that there could be no mishaps, Newsom feared firing artillery shells over the freeway might cause accidents and even deaths.\n\nThis drew derision from Hilton the day after the closure. Said Hilton, \"(The) I-5 scandal was the final straw. For months, it has been clear that the focus of Gavin Newsom's attention has been running for president. Instead of an actual governor, California for the last few months has had a social media manager focused on dopey posts ...\n\n\"This weekend was the final straw...Newsom caused real harm to Californians with his pathetic, divisive stunt: needlessly closing the I-5 so he could blame President Trump for the resulting chaos.\"\n\nIn fact, Newsom's action likely spared Californians a lot of grief. By the time Hilton's campaign sent his release, Newsom's worries had been proven valid.\n\nThis became clear after one chunk of shrapnel from an artillery shell fired over the I-5 landed on the hood of a Highway Patrol cruiser parked on an off-ramp and some more hit a police motorcycle in the Vance motorcade. Other shrapnel landed on the freeway.\n\nImagine the havoc had traffic been moving at its usual 75-80 mph pace along the same stretch of 10-lane highway. Consider the traffic jam that might have ensued. Imagine the rear enders and potential injuries averted because the road was closed. Yet Hilton blithely sent out his press release a day later, when the shrapnel shower had been widely documented. He led the entire field by one point in the latest Emerson College poll, but that doesn't figure to last once voters learn of his press release faux pas.\n\nHilton's office did not respond to requests for an explanation of why the press release went out when it did and has carried on as if nothing happened. No apology, with phone calls and emails not returned. When will rivals start advertising Hilton's blunder?\n\nIn the end, Hilton's main gripe about Newsom was proven false. It should be difficult for any candidate to survive this, let alone a California Republican hoping to make next year's runoff by unifying the GOP vote around himself.",

    "body": "Former Vice President Kamala Harris threw her support behind the effort to temporarily gerrymander California's congressional map in order to send more Democrats to fight President Donald Trump's agenda in Washington.\n\nThe ballot initiative, called Prop 50, was introduced by Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) to \"fight fire with fire\" -- and it has been gaining endorsements among the Democratic establishment as Election Day nears.\n\nSupporters argue that Republicans have not been playing fair by passing extremely gerrymandered state maps in places like Texas and North Carolina. A website explaining the proposal says those new maps amount to a \"power grab\" by Trump and his allies.\n\nProp 50 could flip five House seats blue in a very narrowly divided chamber.\n\n\"I voted yes for Prop 50 because Donald Trump and the Republicans are trying to rig the system,\" Harris said in a video posted to social media Thursday.\n\n\"And so we, as Californians, are standing up to level the playing field.\"\n\nFormer President Barack Obama endorsed the initiative last week, saying in a social media video of his own that \"Republicans want to steal enough seats in Congress to rig the next election and wield unchecked power for two more years.\"\n\nThe 2026 midterms will come with the highest stakes of any midterm election in memory, as a referendum on Trump's second administration.\n\nA new Public Institute of California poll shows a majority of residents are in favor of the proposal, while the Republican campaign against it appears to have stalled. Newsom told supporters to stop donating to the Prop 50 cause because it has received so much funding.\n\nThe California Democratic Party has already endorsed the initiative, along with Equality California, a progressive LGBTQ+ group.\n\nCritically, the new California map would expire in 2030, at which point the state would redraw the lines through an independent redistricting commission.\n\nSome Democrats are already mobilizing around the gerrymandered map, starting to figure out who will run for the new blue districts, The New York Times reported.\n\nAmong Prop 50's more vocal detractors is former Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Trump critic who also strongly opposes gerrymandering.",

It is so unbelievably important and if you need any help voting you can go to http://vote.ca.gov.\"\n\nCalifornia voters passed a constitutional amendment in 2008 to create an independent redistricting commission that would take the task of drawing districts out of the hands of politicians.\n\nDemocrats gamed the system anyway, stripping Republican seats by having political operatives pose as disinterested residents for the purpose of providing evidence to the commission.\n\nHowever, the resulting maps, in 2010 and 2020, at least left some conservative or competitive districts in the state. Republicans currently hold nine seats out of a total of 52 -- about 17% of the whole, which is roughly half the share of the actual Republican vote (about 40%) in the state.\n\nNewsom's map could eliminate four or five of those seats, knocking Republican representation below 10%. Effectively, Prop 50 disenfranchises hundreds of thousands of California voters -- at a cost of $251 million for running the special election.\n\nHis goal is to counteract the effect of Texas redrawing its districts to eliminate several \"majority-minority\" districts that the Department of Justice says were impermissibly drawn after the last Census by relying on race.\n\nThe 2020 Census also disadvantaged conservative states and helped liberal states, resulting in a lopsided map in favor of Democrats nationwide. Republicans hold the House by a narrow margin; Newsom hopes to help Democrats' prospects of retaking it, thereby staking a claim to national leadership in the party.",

    "title": "Newsom's redistricting campaign unlocks a new donor army ahead of 2028",
    "body": "The influx of new supporters, plus their email addresses, cell phone numbers and other coveted details, could give Newsom a significant leg up in what is widely expected to be a crowded Democratic primary.\n\n\"What stands out is just how large the online fundraising operation is. Newsom has been invested in this for a long time, his team does exceptional work, and now he's got the nation's attention in a way that he never did with this proposition,\" said Mike Nellis, a Democratic strategist who led Kamala Harris' digital fundraising operation for her 2020 presidential campaign.\n\n\"If he decides to run for president -- which I believe he will -- he's going to enter with ... one of the largest digital fundraising and Democratic databases of anybody else, which is a tremendous asset,\" added Nellis, who does not work for Newsom.\n\nNewsom's redistricting initiative has drawn donations from more than 107,000 identifiable individual donors, according to a POLITICO analysis of campaign finance data. That total, which only includes itemized donations from those who have given at least $100, accounts for more donors than Newsom's 2018 and 2022 campaigns and his 2021 recall committee had combined.\n\nMoreover, nearly half of the donors to Newsom's ballot measure committee -- more than 52,000 -- are from outside of California. That is in sharp contrast to the governor's previous fundraising efforts and reflects how the redistricting campaign has expanded Newsom's national profile.\n\nThe Yes on 50 campaign consciously nationalized the ballot measure, casting the California gerrymander as a check on Trump's overall presidential agenda and an essential step for Democrats to win control of the House in next year's midterm elections.\n\n\"Any success Governor Newsom enjoys with small-dollar donors and volunteers is purely a demonstration of support for his work and leadership on this issue and others,\" said Tim Tagaris, who leads the campaign's digital organizing, in a statement. \"That's the magic trick. Leadership gets rewarded.\"\n\nThe campaign has proven to be a fundraising juggernaut, raking in roughly $114 million in just 10 weeks. The bulk of that haul has come from seven- and eight-figure donations from House Majority PAC, the super PAC aligned with House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, progressive mega-donors such as George Soros and a constellation of California and national labor unions.\n\nBut a sizable amount has come from small and mid-size donors, a grassroots base that is almost unheard of for state ballot measure campaigns.\n\n\"I've worked on a number of ballot measures. Usually the number you have for grassroots fundraising is zero,\" said Andy Barr, a Democratic strategist based in Berkeley who runs a digital advertising and fundraising firm.\n\nFor Prop 50, more than 80 percent of identifiable first-time donors to Newsom gave $250 or less, the POLITICO analysis found, and that figure does not include smaller donors whose contributions are not itemized. The vast majority of new contributors -- 99.8 percent -- gave less than $3,500, which is the limit an individual can give to a federal candidate. In other words, this infusion of givers could be a potent funding stream in the next Democratic presidential primary.\n\nThere is no guarantee these donors would hop on the Newsom-for-2028 bandwagon. Democratic strategists outside the Newsom team said the measure's fundraising success reflects Democratic donors' thirst to do anything to combat Trump; Prop 50 just happened to be the first vehicle to channel that desire.\n\n\"You can come in with 5 million donors, and then it'll be a question of how many of them are sticking with you when you're running for president,\" said Nellis, who runs one of the party's biggest digital firms. \"There's a lot of people who I'm sure are really happy with Gavin Newsom because of the memes and Prop 50, and other things. But they might not be with him when he runs for president. So there's a question of conversion. There's a question of holding on to those people.\"\n\nStill, Nellis said, the toughest challenge in digital fundraising is to get someone to donate for the first time.\n\nOperatives credited Newsom not just for generating an impressive political list, but for building credibility with those donors.\n\nCase in point: a recent missive sent from the Yes on 50 committee with an unorthodox subject line that read: \"You can stop donating now. Thank you.\"\n\nThe email boasted the campaign had hit its budget goals and raised $38 million through online small-dollar donations, asserting it had enough money to win the ballot measure fight. Instead of seeking more dollars, the email encouraged readers to subscribe to Newsom's YouTube channel and sign up to receive text messages from his operation.\n\nIn a follow-up email, Newsom's committee raised money for Democrats in Indiana, where Republicans, under pressure from Trump, have taken steps to redraw a more GOP-friendly congressional map. Within a day, the campaign said it raised $150,000.\n\n\"They have done an incredible job -- and this sounds so basic but nobody follows it -- asking people for things that are real, and giving them a real reason to support something,\" Barr said. \"You don't see the Newsom email program hitting people up all the time, just because it's a day ending in 'y.'\"",

    "title": "Californians will soon vote on a ballot initiative that could boost Democratic midterm hopes - The Boston Globe",
    "body": "With Proposition 50, a ballot question that will be decided in a statewide Nov. 4 election, Governor Gavin Newsom and California Democrats are responding to President Trump's unprecedented and successful push for Texas and other Republican-led states to redraw their congressional districts in order to gain seats and block Democrats from recapturing control of the House of Representatives .\n\nBackers of Prop. 50 are asking Californians to temporarily overrule the state's independent redistricting commission -- one voters themselves created at the ballot box in 2010 -- and approve new maps that would carve up Republican districts, likely netting Democrats five House seats in the process. The redistricting is the only question on the statewide ballot before voters on Tuesday; if passed, the new maps would be in effect for the next three congressional elections.\n\nIf Democrats are successful, the thinking goes, they'll be on their way to neutralizing the redistricting that Texas Republicans did and preserving their chances to flip the House in 2026, their best chance to check Trump in his second term.\n\nUnderscoring the national stakes, Newsom's Ballot Measure Committee's closing ad featured some of the party's most prominent figures: from former President Barack Obama to Representative Alexandria Ocasio Cortez of New York to Senator Elizabeth Warren.\n\n\"You have the power to give America a fair midterm,\" Warren says in the ad.\n\nBut California Democrats also believe Prop. 50 has become their best chance yet to show the rest of the country that the resistance to Trump has, finally, gotten some teeth. The considerable energy and engagement around the ballot question, apparent across the state, speaks to how hungry many Californians are for a victory with national significance.\n\n\"The Democrats that we talk to and the volunteers that come to the door are engaged because it gives us an opportunity to do something,\" said Val Hinshaw, a coordinator at the Sonoma County Democratic Party overseeing local get-out-the-vote efforts for Prop. 50.\n\n\"We've been waiting for Democrats to stand up and fight back, alright, so this is a way for us to do that,\" she said. \"So they don't need convincing. It's, 'How can I help?' \"\n\nRepresentative Jared Huffman, a Democrat who represents parts of Sonoma County, said Prop. 50 is \"crushing it\" and while he would like a big, statement-making victory, \"the win is the most important thing.\"\n\n\"That's what's going to send the message, that the California Democrats, and anti-Trump independents, are so morally clear about this moment that they pass this extraordinary initiative, because this is extraordinary,\" he said.\n\nThat much is true on several levels: statewide, California voters have never before gone to the polls in an off-election year to decide the fate of just one ballot question. They also haven't had much chance in recent years to shape national politics in such a direct way.\n\nMost public polls of Prop. 50 show it passing; one released last week from Emerson College found it hitting 57 percent support. Given the state's blue hue, the measure would likely pass easily just with the support of anti-Trump independents and Democrats.\n\nCalifornia is in for major changes under Prop. 50, even if they're temporary. State Democratic lawmakers have already drawn new maps if Prop. 50 passes that would eliminate five GOP-held congressional seats -- likely reducing Republicans to just four seats total out of the state's massive 52-member delegation.\n\nFew places illustrate the on-the-ground changes better than Sonoma County, on the northern edge of the San Francisco Bay Area. The county would be split into three districts extending far into swaths of interior northern California, thus breaking up Republican districts by separating Republican voters and adding in Democratic ones.\n\nHuffman's district would be among the most transformed, taking in both blue coastal enclaves like Sonoma and ruby-red rural counties in the northeast of the state that are hundreds of miles apart and have little in common culturally or politically. He would have the distinction of representing both California's second-most Democratic county and its second-most Republican county.\n\n\"This moment is so much bigger than me or the contours of my little congressional district,\" Huffman said. \"This is about whether American democracy survives.\"\n\nThese are the types of misshapen, easy-to-ridicule districts Californians wished to avoid by creating a politically balanced, citizen-led redistricting commission in 2010. It's a different system than many states, including blue bastions such as New York and Illinois, where Democratic politicians have created favorable maps for themselves.\n\nHinshaw, the Sonoma County Democratic volunteer, said that emphasizing the temporary nature of Prop. 50 often helps persuade people who were concerned about overriding the independent commission process.\n\n\"Sometimes we feel that blue states are doing the right things while red states are doing what they want to overrule and override their own constituents,\" she said. \"So it was important for us to be able to understand the significant details of the ballot measure, which means that it's temporary, and the redistricting commission will be reinstated back in 2030 for the next census.\"\n\nWith chances of defeating the measure flagging, opponents of Prop. 50 are framing the fight in different terms.\n\nThe most prominent public face of the No on 50 effort is Carl DeMaio, a pugnacious Republican state lawmaker from San Diego. At a town hall rally in Santa Rosa on Friday, DeMaio avoided the argument that the measure should be defeated to preserve Republicans' chances of holding Congress.\n\n\"Prop. 50 is not about Trump or Texas,\" said DeMaio. Instead, he described the stakes as part of a broader \"war\" to \"take back our state,\" in which Prop. 50 was just one of several instances of what he called overreach by a power-hungry Newsom and a corrupt state Democratic establishment.\n\nThe most direct pitch to vote no on Prop. 50, underscored in TV ads run by DeMaio's group Reform California, is \"two wrongs don't make a right.\" In Santa Rosa, DeMaio asked attendees, many of whom were wearing pro-Trump and anti-Newsom hats and buttons, to appeal to Democrats' and independents' sense of fairness when they were out canvassing votes.\n\nHe offered a suggested pitch: \"I bet you acknowledge that it's wrong, but you think that Trump is so bad and Texas is doing it, so you think that the end justifies the means.\"\n\nRepublicans are not optimistic about success, however; even DeMaio conceded Prop. 50 is likely to pass. \"They all know it's not right, but they need to get back at Trump,\" said Peggy Maddock, of Healdsburg, a retired teacher, who was volunteering at the No on 50 event. \"If it passes, Republicans, their voices will not be heard. It silences us.\"\n\nBut the same arguments could be easily made against Republicans in other states who sparked the redistricting back-and-forth in the first place. Over the summer, Texas GOP legislators, urged on by Governor Greg Abbott and Trump, enacted new maps that eliminated five Democratic districts by slicing up Democratic voters in urban areas and parsing them out to GOP-majority districts.\n\nOther Republican-led states have attempted to follow suit, hoping to further pad Republicans' slim House majority. Moreover, if the Supreme Court overturns the principle of majority-minority districts in a case before it on the Voting Rights Act of 1965, Republicans could pick up even more seats, granting themselves a distinct advantage even with California's changes. With other Democratic-led states like Illinois waffling on drawing new lines, California could represent Democrats' only real chance to negate GOP efforts.\n\nAt the anti-Prop. 50 rally, some attendees did allow the consideration that California Democrats would not have struck back -- avoiding this contentious political fight in the first place -- had Republicans elsewhere not moved first. But they declined to criticize Republicans in Texas and instead eschewed the broader political context of the redistricting fight.",

    "title": "Poll: Newsom's Gerrymander Leads, 56% to 43%; CA Voters Say 'Threats to Democracy' Biggest Problem",
    "body": "A new poll by the Public Policy Institute of California (PPIC) indicates that 56% of likely voters support Gov. Gavin Newsom's Proposition 50, which would gerrymander the state's congressional map to help Democrats.\n\nThe map -- unseen by most voters -- would replace the one drawn by California' constitutionally-mandated independent redistricting commission, which voters put into place after passing a referendum in 2008.\n\nThe likely effect of the map, created behind closed doors by Democrats, will be to eliminate at least half of the nine seats held by Republicans, who are already underrepresented by half in the existing \"independent\" map.\n\nNewsom and other Democrats argue that Prop 50 is necessary to \"defend democracy,\" though effectively it ends the ability of the opposition party to compete fairly for congressional representation within the state.\n\nCalifornia's voters are willing to disenfranchise themselves because Newsom has successfully convinced them that gerrymandering is the best way to fight President Donald Trump, who is deeply unpopular in the state.\n\nNewsom claims that Prop 50 is a response to a move by Texas to redraw several \"majority-minority\" districts, which will remove five Democrat-held seats. Democrats hope to capture the U.S. House majority next year.\n\nAsked what the biggest problem is facing the country, California voters -- perhaps ironically -- cited threats to democracy, though arguably eliminating the opposition is a far more direct threat to democratic elections.\n\n\"Californians continue to choose political extremism or threats to democracy (40%) as the most important problem facing the United States today, while far fewer choose economic conditions (19%) and immigration (12%) as the top issue,\" the poll reported.\n\nThere was a sharp partisan split: self-identified Republicans oppose Proposition 50 by a whopping 89% to 10%, and Democrats support it 84% to 14%. Voters in Republican-held districts oppose it, 56% to 42% -- nearly the inverse of the state as a whole.\n\nThe poll also found that Newsom had a 55% approval rating -- far higher than that measured in other polls. It also suggested that Newsom had succeeded in moving the electorate off its initial opposition to Prop 50.\n\nNewsom's method in Prop 50, as in the 2021 recall election, has been to frame a state issue or election as a referendum on national politics, casting each vote as way of identifying as Democrats and opposing Trump.\n\nThe poll was conducted from October 7 to 14 among 1,707 adults and 943 likely voters, with a sampling error of 4% for the latter.",

It comes after Duffy, in July, \"put Mexico on notice for its blatant disregard of the 2015 U.S.-Mexico Air Transport Agreement and its ongoing anti-competitive behavior.\"\n\n\"Joe Biden and Pete Buttigieg were too weak to stand up to Mexico when they walked all over our bilateral aviation agreement. These deals are binding, and like our trade agreements, President Trump is going to put America First and enforce them,\" Duffy said in a statement. \"Until Mexico stops the games and honors its commitments, we will continue to hold them accountable.

By restricting slots and mandating that all-cargo operations move out of MEX, Mexico has broken its promise, disrupted the market, and left American businesses holding the bag for millions in increased costs.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum on Wednesday said she disagreed with the Trump administration's moves and will request a meeting between Mexico's foreign minister and Duffy to review the matter, according to Reuters, which added that she is hopeful a deal can be reached.",

    "title": "Poll: Voters in poll side with Newsom, Democrats on Prop. 50  --  a potential blow to Trump and GOP",
    "body": "Early voters strongly favor the proposition, but 70% of those who plan to vote on election day oppose it, reflecting a shift in how Americans cast ballots.\n\nA Nov. 4 statewide ballot measure pushed by California Democrats to help the party's efforts to win control of the U.S. House of Representatives and stifle President Trump's agenda has a substantial lead in a new poll released on Thursday.\n\nSix out of 10 likely voters support Proposition 50, the proposal by Gov. Gavin Newsom and his allies to redraw the state's congressional districts to try to increase the number of Democrats in Congress, according to a survey by UC Berkeley's Institute of Governmental Studies that was co-sponsored by The Times. About 38% of likely voters oppose the ballot measure.\n\nNotable in an off-year special election about the arcane and complicated process of redistricting, 71% of likely voters said they had heard a significant amount of information about the ballot measure, according to the poll.\n\n\"That's extraordinary,\" said Mark DiCamillo, director of the IGS poll. \"Even though it's kind of an esoteric topic that doesn't affect their daily lives, it's something voters are paying attention to.\"\n\nThat may be because roughly $158 million has been donated in less than three months to the main campaign committees supporting and opposing the measure, according to campaign fundraising reports filed with the state last week. Voters in the state have been flooded with political ads.\n\nCalifornians watching Tuesday night's World Series game between the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Toronto Blue Jays saw that firsthand.\n\nIn the first minutes of the game, former President Obama, Newsom, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and other prominent Democrats spoke in favor of Proposition 50 in an ad that probably cost at least $250,000 to air, according to a Democratic media buyer who is not associated with the campaign.\n\nAccording to the survey, the breakdown among voters was highly partisan, with more than 9 out of 10 Democrats supporting Proposition 50 and a similar proportion of Republicans opposing it. Among voters who belong to other parties, or identify as \"no party preference,\" 57% favored the ballot measure, while 39% opposed it.\n\nOnly 2% of the likely voters surveyed said they were undecided, which DiCamillo said was highly unusual.\n\nHistorically, undecided voters, particularly independents, often end up opposing ballot measures they are uncertain about, preferring to stick with the status quo, he said.\n\n\"Usually there was always a rule -- look at the undecideds in late-breaking polls, and assume most would vote no,\" he said. \"But this poll shows there are very few of them out there. Voters have a bead on this one.\"\n\nIn the voter-rich urban areas of Los Angeles County and the San Francisco Bay area, Proposition 50 led by wide margins, the poll found. Voters in Orange County, the Inland Empire and the Central Valley were pretty evenly divided.\n\nRedistricting battles are underway in states across the nation, but California's Proposition 50 has received a major share of national attention and donations. The Newsom committee supporting Proposition 50 has raised far more money than the two main committees opposing it, so much so that the governor this week told supporters to stop sending checks.\n\nThe U.S. House of Representatives is controlled by the GOP but is narrowly divided. The party that wins control of Congress in the 2026 midterm elections will determine whether Trump can continue enacting his agenda or whether he is the subject of investigations and possibly another impeachment effort.\n\nCalifornia's 52 congressional districts -- the most of any state -- currently are drawn by a voter-approved independent commission once every decade following the U.S. census.\n\nBut after Trump urged GOP leaders in Texas this summer to redraw their districts to bolster the number of Republicans in Congress, Newsom and other California Democrats decided in August to ask voters to allow a rare mid-decade partisan redrawing of the state's district boundaries. If passed, Proposition 50 could potentially add five more Democrats to the state's congressional delegation.\n\nSupporters of Proposition 50 have painted their effort as a proxy fight against Trump and his policies that have overwhelmingly affected Californians, such as immigration raids and the deployment of the National Guard on the streets of Los Angeles.\n\nOpponents of the proposition have focused on the mechanics of redistricting, arguing the ballot measure subverts the will of California voters who enacted the independent redistricting commission more than a decade ago.\n\n\"The results suggest that Democrats have succeeded in framing the debate surrounding the proposition around support or opposition to President Trump and national Republicans, rather than about voters' more general preference for nonpartisan redistricting,\" Eric Schickler, co-director of IGS, said in a statement.\n\nEarly voting data suggest the pro-Proposition 50 message has been successful.\n\nAs of Tuesday, nearly 5 million Californians -- about 21% of the state's 23 million registered voters -- had cast ballots, according to trackers run by Democratic and Republican strategists.\n\nDemocrats greatly outnumber Republicans among the state's registered voters, and they have outpaced them in returning ballots, 52% to 27%. Voters who do not have a party preference or who support other political parties have returned 21% of the ballots.\n\nThe Berkeley/L.A. Times poll findings mirrored recent surveys by the Public Policy Institute of California, CBS News/YouGov and Emerson College.\n\nAmong voters surveyed by the Berkeley/L.A. Times poll, 67% of Californians who had already voted supported Proposition 50, while 33% said they had weighed in against the ballot measure.\n\nThe proposition also had an edge among those who planned to vote but had not yet cast their ballots, with 57% saying they planned to support the effort and 40% saying they planned to oppose it.\n\nHowever, 70% of voters who plan to cast ballots in person on Nov. 4, election day, said they would vote against Proposition 50, according to the poll. Less than 3 in 10 who said they would vote at their local polling place said they would support the rare mid-decade redistricting.\n\nThese numbers highlight a recent shift in how Americans vote. Historically, Republicans voted by mail early, while Democrats cast ballots on election day. But this dynamic was upended in recent years after Trump questioned the security of early voting and mail voting, including just recently when he criticized Proposition 50.\n\n\"No mail-in or 'Early' Voting, Yes to Voter ID! Watch how totally dishonest the California Prop Vote is! Millions of Ballots being 'shipped,'\" Trump wrote on his social media platform, Truth Social. \"GET SMART REPUBLICANS, BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE!!!\"\n\nGOP leaders across the state have pushed back at such messaging without calling out the president. Urging Republicans to vote early, they argue that waiting to cast ballots only gives Democrats a greater advantage in California elections.\n\nAmong the arguments promoted by the campaigns, likely voters agreed with every one posited by the supporters of Proposition 50, notably that the ballot measure would help Democrats win control of the House, while standing up to Trump and his attempts to rig the 2026 election, according to the poll. But they also agreed that the ballot measure would further diminish the power of the GOP in California, and that they didn't trust partisan state lawmakers to draw congressional districts.\n\nThe Berkeley IGS/Times poll surveyed 8,141 California registered voters online in English and Spanish from Oct. 20 to 27. The results are estimated to have a margin of error of 2 percentage points in either direction in the overall sample, and larger numbers for subgroups.",

    "title": "Still unsure about Prop. 50? You might be the only one",
    "body": "The measure has coincided with, and fed, Gov. Gavin Newsom's his new turn as chief troll -- and an effective foil -- to Trump.\n\nHello and happy Thursday. It's me again, California columnist Anita Chabria, filling in for your usual host, Washington bureau chief Michael Wilner, who will be back next week.\n\nCalifornia's Proposition 50, the measure that would redraw election maps to favor Democrats, started out seeming controversial and likely to spark a huge battle.\n\nBut in recent days, it's become clear that the majority of Californians are pro-50. So much so that Gov. Gavin Newsom has offered up the ultimate taunt -- he's ended small-donor fundraising on the measure. Can you imagine President Trump telling MAGA, \"Keep your five bucks, it's better in your pocket than mine.\"\n\nSo it's sort of like Newsom is walking across the finish line flush with swagger and cash -- maybe not wise, but a statement.\n\nObviously, Newsom will soon be asking for more money for more things, including his was-never-not-happening presidential bid. But for now, the narrative he's crafted with Proposition 50 (win or lose, because truly you don't know until the last ballot is counted) is a consequential and important win for democracy and a ray of hope for the next election, merely a year away.\n\nHere's why.\n\nThe big secret you should know about Proposition 50 is that it was never unpopular with California's blue voters.\n\nSure, Republicans hate it. Especially those, such as Rep. Kevin Kiley (R-Rocklin), who will probably lose their jobs if it passes. I'll give Kiley credit on this -- he for a short bit tried to convince his party that all mid-decade redistricting was bad. He had no luck, mostly because House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) rolls like jelly when it comes to Trump.\n\nBut the majority of Republicans in California and across the country have offered nary a whisper in condemnation of red-tilting cheat maps.\n\nIn truth, Proposition 50 started out as a bluff -- nothing more than a way to push back on Texas Republicans who were working full speed to appease Trump by rejiggering their own maps to provide him with a safe margin of seats for the midterms.\n\nHoping to deter Texas appeasement GOPers from this scorched-earth pursuit, Texas Democratic congressional representatives started floating the rumor this year that if the Lone Star State went forward with its scheme to create five extra red seats, California would do the same for blue. It was nothing more than a bit of tit-for-tat blustering.\n\nThere was, however, no such plan by Newsom, and insiders say the feint took the governor by surprise. But kind of a happy surprise, because the idea caught on like wildfire and -- even more surprising -- turned out to be legally doable.\n\nNewsom's team did a couple of polls and guess what? Yep, voters wanted to fight back against Trump's takeover. Congressional Democrats, including Nancy Pelosi, agreed to back the measure and fundraise and here we are: A poll by UC Berkeley's Institute of Governmental Studies, co-sponsored by The Times, found that 6 in 10 likely voters support the measure, and of those who have already voted, 67% are in favor.\n\nThat backs up another new poll by the Public Policy Institute of California that found 56% of likely voters support the measure, mostly along party lines. Forty-three percent are against it.\n\nOnly 2% were undecided in The Times' poll, and that dropped to 1% in the PPIC poll.\n\nSo Californians have made up their minds -- now they just need to mail their ballots (I swear I will send mine very, very soon).\n\nSo let's say Proposition 50 does sail to victory. What then? Will it really save democracy, which is really in need of saving?\n\nProbably not. Maybe. Hopefully? Here's the truth. Our elections are in hugely big trouble, which I wrote about on Tuesday. For the vast majority of you who didn't read that, here's the recap: Donald Trump will probably try to cheat.\n\nThat suppression may take many forms. It could be new rules to make it harder to vote -- such as requiring multiple forms of IDs with matching names (which many married women lack). It could involve something as dire as military \"protection\" of our polls. It may look like another attempt to end mail-in ballots or early voting.\n\nIt could involve Mike \"Jelly\" Johnson refusing to seat elected Democrats, as he is currently doing with Arizona's newly elected, release-the-Epstein-files Arizona Rep. Adelita Grijalva.\n\nIt will almost certainly include charges of voter fraud, which Trump is already yapping about on social media. And it will almost certainly involve Republican gerrymandered maps in states besides Texas (though there are surprising holdouts in places including Nebraska).\n\nAll of that is to say that the midterms are going to be both a big, steaming mess and historically important.\n\nBut Proposition 50 shows that not only is there will to resist this breakdown of democracy, but there are also ways to fight. Whether or not it ultimately is the key to restoring the power check of an independent Congress, it's an important proof that the fight is not over.\n\nThere are a couple of other things that stand out in this moment of uncertainty. First, Newsom is the Comeback Kid. There was a time after Kamala Harris took the Democratic nomination when his chances of ever sitting behind the Resolute Desk seemed slim. But Proposition 50 coincided with, and fed, his new turn as chief troll -- and actually as an effective foil -- to Trump.\n\nHe has quickly become one of the most recognizable leaders nationwide in fighting authoritarianism, and to his credit, he is speaking truth at a difficult moment.\n\nYes, that benefits him, but I'll take pro-democracy pushback wherever I find it -- and so apparently will other Californians. The same PPIC poll that found the majority of likely voters support Proposition 50 also found that 55% approve of the way Newsom is doing his job, and about half think California is on the right track.\n\nNationally, he's gaining ground too. Another poll about the New Hampshire primary, often considered one of the first harbingers of Democratic things to come, found Newsom in second place after former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.\n\nIn a couple of other polls, Newsom is in the mix, along with Buttigieg and New York U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. So he's in the running, and not just in his own head -- making Proposition 50 a win for the governor.\n\nBut Congress, that's another story. Californians (and Americans in general) are not pleased with their congressional representatives. The PPIC poll found that only 14% of California adults are happy with the way Congress is doing its job. Honestly, judging from the way I feel about it, that seems high.\n\nSo keep your eye on California races, even after the maps are redrawn. The youngs are after the olds, and voters seem ready for change. Pelosi is facing two serious challengers, including state Sen. Scott Wiener. In Sacramento, Rep. Doris Matsui has a youthful contender.\n\nCalifornia voters may end up wanting even more change than Democrats anticipate. They're clearly in a mood to fight, and no telling with whom.\n\nThe must-read: We checked DHS's videos of chaos and protests. Here's what they leave out.\n\nThe what happened: The Republicans thwarting the White House's redistricting hopes\n\nThe L.A. Times special: ICE officials replaced with Border Patrol, cementing hard tactics that originated in California\n\nP.S. More from Homeland Security. This is deeply disturbing propaganda being produced and disseminated without much remark by an armed federal agency. For those who aren't J.R.R. Tolkien nerds, it's a reference to a great evil destroying society. Whether or not you support the removal of undocumented people, the portrayal of all undocumented folks as evil and dangerous is well ... dangerous. And wrong.",

    "title": "How Newsom has capitalized on anger with Trump in California ballot fight",
    "body": "California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) has made President Donald Trump the chief adversary in efforts to pass a redistricting plan in his state. (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)\n\nLOS ANGELES -- When a pair of Democratic door knockers asked Reid Pelsue on a recent Saturday whether he was familiar with an upcoming high-stakes special election, he told them he had no idea what they were talking about.\n\nBut when they said they were pushing a ballot measure to fight what they called President Donald Trump's \"power grab,\" by enabling Democrats to redraw the state's congressional map and add as many as five more seats to offset what Republicans were doing outside California, he was sold.\n\n\"It just hurts,\" Pelsue, 23, said of Trump's second term, citing the administration's immigration crackdown and voicing concern about the president's mid-decade redistricting push. Shooing his cats back inside, Pelsue went to grab his phone so the organizers could guide him to a website where he could request a ballot and find polling locations.\n\nAs California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) and his allies try to nudge their plan across the finish line in Tuesday's election, they are focusing squarely on Trump, running television commercials, digital ads and an aggressive canvassing operation that holds up the president as their chief adversary. Their bet, placed months ago before they had even launched the campaign, is that anger with Trump in a deep-blue state will motivate people to vote yes on Proposition 50 and simplify an appeal some initially worried could become muddled in the arcana of redistricting.\n\nThe strategy appears to be paying dividends as the campaign nears its conclusion, fueling a stark fundraising advantage and edge in the polls that Democrats hope will help deliver a concrete rebuttal to Trump's political agenda less than a year into his second term. Proponents of Prop 50, which include of a constellation of committees led by one Newsom is helming, outraised the opposing side by a wide margin through Oct. 18, campaign finance data show. At a critical juncture earlier this month when many voters had received their mailed ballots, two of the main committees urging Californians to vote no went dark on broadcast and satellite television, according to data from AdImpact, the latest indicator of an opposition campaign that has sputtered.\n\nThe fundraising imbalance had tipped so far in favor of advocates of the ballot measure this week that Newsom sent a fundraising message Monday telling supporters they could \"stop donating.\" \"We have hit our budget goals and raised what we need in order to pass Proposition 50,\" the Democratic governor wrote. \"Now it's about executing the plan. If we can do that, we're going to win.\" (On Tuesday, Newsom sent out a fundraising solicitation asking for $3 to fight GOP redistricting moves in Indiana).\n\nThe election in California, one of several states casting ballots on Nov. 4, will provide a measure of the potency of Democrats' frequently used anti-Trump message in a setting where it has not been tested: An off-year election in the country's most populous state, with no candidates on the ballot. While Newsom and his allies are sounding confident notes, observers cautioned that since the election is unlike most others in recent memory, a surprise outcome is possible.\n\nA Public Policy Institute of California poll showed that 56 percent of likely California voters said they will vote yes on Prop 50, while 43 percent said they will vote no. A CBS News survey showed a 62 percent to 38 percent spread.\n\nNewsom and his allies released a closing ad this week that tells viewers they can \"stand up to Donald Trump.\" It features former president Barack Obama and other prominent Democrats, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-New York).\n\nTrump has avoided getting directly or publicly involved in campaign activities involving the California ballot measure. But he recently sought, without evidence, to discredit the vote in a Truth Social post. Trump has also repeatedly insulted Newsom's competence as governor. Newsom has trolled the president with mocking posts on his own social media. The White House did not respond to a request for comment for this story.\n\nNewsom, who initially tried to collaborate with Trump after he was elected, pivoted to a sharply adversarial posture after Trump sent military troops into Los Angeles this summer in the midst of immigration protests -- before making Trump his chief foil in the redistricting campaign.\n\n\"Fear and anger are very powerful forces in politics -- and it's the Democrats that are fearful and angry,\" said California Republican strategist Kevin Spillane.\n\nCalifornia Democrats have pointed frequently to the outsize impact of Trump's tactics on their state -- from his administration's immigration raids, to his deployment of federal troops in Los Angeles, to the slashing of key education and research grants for California institutions. Underpinning those figures are the low approval ratings for Trump and his actions in California. The PPIC poll showed that just 26 percent of Californians approve of the way Trump is handling his job. Large majorities of Californians disapprove of the job that Immigration and Customs Enforcement is doing (71 percent) and the tariffs the U.S. has placed on imports (72 percent).\n\nOpponents of Newsom's plan have used an array of tactics aimed at different parts of the electorate, ranging from ads suggesting it would destroy the state's independent redistricting process to events where they have argued the new maps would break up Asian American communities and dilute the power of rural constituencies. In one ad, they also featured comments from former California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger (R) arguing for keeping the independent redistricting system he helped create and stating that Prop 50 would \"take us backwards.\" Privately, many Republicans in the state have been critical of what they viewed as a scattered unfocused message from the \"no\" side.\n\nJessica Millan Patterson, the chair of No on 50 -- Stop Sacramento's Power Grab, one of the committees opposing Newsom's ballot measure, said in a recent interview that her group believes the vote will be close and credited Trump's team for helping with turnout efforts. She argued that their message that \"the power is being taken away from the people\" with Newsom's ballot measure resonates with many independent voters. The committee is backed by former House speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-California).\n\n\"We always knew this was going to be an uphill battle for us,\" she said. \"We are making sure that we are targeting specific individuals that are persuadable in these last few days.\"\n\nThe Congressonal Leadership Fund, which is aligned with House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-Louisiana), gave money to the committee as well as the state GOP, while Charles Munger Jr. -- the Stanford physicist and Berkshire Hathaway heir who helped finance the original ballot measures creating the state's independent process -- funded a different committee opposing the measure with nearly $33 million.\n\nBut some of the money that opponents of the measure hoped would materialize has not arrived -- all while the opposition has raised money at a brisk pace. Newsom's ballot committee raised $114 million through the period ending on Oct. 18, while the McCarthy-aligned No on Prop 50 -- Stop Sacramento's Power Grab and the Munger-aligned No on Prop 50 -- Protect Voters First, raised $43.7 million over that same period.\n\n\"While we are being significantly outspent, there are still millions of votes to be submitted, and the campaign will focus on communicating to persuadable voters and turning out supporters,\" said Amy Thoma Tan, a spokeswoman for the Munger-aligned committee who declined to discuss the campaign's fundraising strategy.\n\nAbout a fifth of the 23 million ballots sent out had been returned as of Tuesday, according to Political Data Incorporated, which supplies data to Democratic groups and campaigns, and of those ballots, more than half were from Democrats.\n\n\"Nine days before the election, ballots are coming in at a faster pace than they were in the 2024 general election,\" said Paul Mitchell, vice president at PDI. He said that is in part because there is only one question on the ballot.\n\nNewsom worked with members of Congress and the California legislature to get the Democratic-leaning maps on the November ballot once it became clear that Texas lawmakers were going to approve maps creating five new GOP-leaning seats at Trump's behest. They pitched the measure as a direct response to Trump -- a temporary patch that would put the new maps in place for 2026, 2028 and 2030, before allowing the state's independent commission to resume its work drawing lines.\n\nNewsom's ballot measure offered donors and voters a chance to deliver a tangible blow to Trump's agenda. The money quickly started pouring in and the enormous war chest allowed Newsom's ballot committee to flood the airwaves and digital media with ads. \"Wake up America,\" Newsom said in one ad, accusing Trump of trying to \"rig the system\" and warning that democracy would disappear district by district.\n\nThe most widely circulated ad of the yes campaign featured Obama, a onetime critic of partisan gerrymandering. He accused the GOP of trying to \"steal enough seats in Congress to rig the next election\" and give Trump \"unchecked power for two more years.\" Prop 50, the former president argued, \"levels the playing field.\"\n\nIn these final days, Democrats have urged voters not to get complacent. At the doors she has knocked on in Cheviot Hills and Long Beach, including Pelsue's, Anissa Raja has repeatedly described the ballot question to voters as an \"emergency measure.\"\n\n\"This is for all the folks who want to get involved,\" said Raja, who heads the Los Angeles County Young Democrats, as she walked doors with her script. \"You want to figure out how to fight back? Yeah, it's by voting.\"",

    "title": "Trump ramps up involvement in this year's elections in possible preview of midterms pressure - The Boston Globe",
    "body": "Late last week, Trump's Department of Justice announced it was sending election monitors to observe voting in one county in New Jersey, which features a race for governor that Trump has become deeply invested in, and to five counties in California, where Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom is pushing a ballot measure to counter the president's own effort to rejigger the congressional map to elect more Republicans.\n\nThat announcement was followed with a pre-emptive attack by Trump on the legitimacy of California's elections. The post on his own social media platform echoed the baseless allegations he made about the 2020 presidential election before he and his allies tried to overturn his loss in a campaign that culminated in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.\n\n\"Watch how totally dishonest the California Prop Vote is!\" Trump wrote last weekend on Truth Social, referring to Proposition 50, the lone issue on the state's special election ballot. \"Millions of Ballots being 'shipped.'\"\n\nThe combination has prompted responses from several prominent Democrats, who were already bracing for Trump to use his presidential powers to tilt next year's midterms to his side.\n\n\"It's a bridge they're trying to build the scaffolding for, all across this country, in next November's elections,\" Newsom said in a video in which he also predicted the administration will send masked immigration agents to polling stations next week.\n\nDuring early voting so far, there has been no indication that troops or federal officers have shown up near polling sites or ballot drop boxes in any state. Despite the warnings from some Democrats, millions of voters already have cast ballots through early in-person or mail voting, a process that has produced no significant problems.\n\nTrump has long accused the Biden administration of trying to interfere in last year's presidential election after the Justice Department filed federal charges against him related to his attempts to overturn the 2020 results and his retention of classified documents after leaving office.\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson, using the president's favorite derogatory nickname for California's governor, said in a statement on Wednesday: \"Newscum ought to stop fearmongering to score political points with the radical left flank of the Democrat party that he is courting ahead of his doomed-to-fail presidential campaign.\"\n\nTuesday's elections are purely state-based, with no federal offices on the ballot. Trump has no ability to change the outcome in any way, experts said.\n\n\"Voters who go to vote in the 2025 election are going to find a very safe and secure process,\" said David Becker, a former Department of Justice voting rights attorney who now runs the Center for Election Innovation & Research. \"For example, I'm 100% confident that whoever wins the statewide elections in Virginia and New Jersey, regardless of what the president says, will take office.\"\n\nThe relatively low-profile off-year elections are headlined by the races for governor in New Jersey and Virginia, California's redistricting question and the mayor's race in New York City.\n\nTwo of the states where voting already is underway are considering measures that have major implications for next year's midterms.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, voters will decide whether three Democratic justices keep their seats on the state's supreme court. If they're removed, the court will have a 2-2 ideological split and potentially be unable to resolve disputes over voting and election procedures next year in the critical swing state.\n\nIn California, voters will decide whether to temporarily override an independent redistricting process and allow the Democratic-controlled Legislature to redraw the state's congressional districts. If voters pass the measure, it could create five new seats Democrats could win to counter Trump's push for Texas and other Republican-led states to redraw their districts and increase the number of winnable Republican House seats.\n\nThat's one reason the administration's decision to send monitors drew so much attention. It's not unusual for the federal government to send monitors to observe voting and ballot counting in certain areas, but it's typically done in consultation with local jurisdictions. That did not happen this time.\n\nInstead, the Trump administration announced the monitors solely in response to requests from local Republican parties.\n\nFederal monitors are only allowed to observe, are prohibited from talking to voters or even poll workers, and have no way to influence the counting of votes, said Becker, who has served as a monitor and also trained them.\n\n\"I don't think voters are ever going to notice or see any of these people,\" he said.\n\nStill, the Democratic attorneys general in California and New Jersey raised alarms, with New Jersey's Matt Platkin calling it \"highly inappropriate\" and California's Rob Bonta saying the move is especially concerning given Trump's record.\n\n\"These are not normal times,\" Bonta said in a call with reporters this week. \"We have to look at the broader context here about what the Trump administration is saying and what they are doing.\"\n\nThe action follows a monthslong campaign by Trump to use the powers of his office to boost his party's political prospects ahead of the midterms, where the incumbent party traditionally loses seats in Congress. The president has pushed states where Republicans control the redistricting process to redraw their boundaries to create more conservative-friendly seats. He also has directed his administration to investigate Democratic politicians, fundraisers and donors.\n\nNewsom and his Illinois counterpart, Gov. JB Pritzker, have warned that Trump's attempts to send the U.S. military into their states' most populous cities -- Los Angeles and Chicago -- are precursors to deploying the military or federal agents to polling places in Democratic-leaning cities next year.\n\nThey and other Democrats also have alluded to how some Trump allies in 2020 used manufactured claims of election fraud to propose using the military to seize voting machines.\n\nAt the same time, the Justice Department is demanding detailed voter data from the states and Trump issued an executive order trying to reshape how elections are run, which has been largely halted by the courts because the Constitution gives that power to the states, and, in some cases, Congress. It spells out no role for the president in setting election rules.\n\nUntil fairly recently, Trump had been relatively quiet about the 2025 elections, mostly taking steps that other presidents have made in election years, such as supporting his party's nominees in key races.\n\nHannah Fried, executive director of the voting rights group All Voting is Local, said the Nov. 4 election will provide \"an important set of data points\" about issues that could crop up in future elections, especially next year.",

    "body": "The governor said Trump will try to advance his agenda \"by any means necessary.\"\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom said the country is facing a \"five-alarm fire\" as President Donald Trump tries to \"win by any means necessary\" to advance his agenda.\n\n\"I really am scared to death about what's going on in this country. I really believe it is Code Red. It's five alarm fire,\" Newsom told ABC News' Jonathan Karl.\n\n\"We won't have a country. We won't have an election that's fair and free if we don't stand up. We won't. There will not be a fair and free election. It'll be a Putin election. Was it 87% or is it 87.3%? That's what Trump wants.\"\n\n\"All the pardoning, all the, this, this great grift -- the biggest, most corrupt administration in history. Not just the $400 million plane, but the billion dollars of your tax money, as we're cutting food stamps to pay for the damn plane so he can take that toy home with his foundation when he's 93 or whatever he's done with his fourth or fifth term.\"\n\n\"I'm deeply concerned about it. And guys like [former Trump adviser Steve] Bannon, they're not screwing around. They're not screwing around.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid we're going to lose our country. And where the hell is everybody? Why aren't we standing up to principle?\" Newsom asked.\n\n\"I'm disgusted what's happened in this country. I'm disgusted by the supine Congress. I'm disgusted by how the private sector is conducting themselves. I'm disgusted by universities selling their soul and law firms. I'm disgusted that people are not more outraged. Forgive me,\" Newsom continued.\n\nNews contrasted the \"childishness\" of Trump to former President Joe Biden, who he called \"one of the most successful presidents in the last century.\"\n\nNewsom told Karl that while he did have disagreements with the former president on issues such as the border, the governor celebrated Biden's long list of accomplishments that he said are being wiped out by Trump.\n\n\"I will defend that to my grave in terms of the CHIPS and Science Act. The infrastructure bill, the work he did on the IRA. The fact that he had a worker-centered industrial policy, and the fact that those are the right policies for this country,\" Newsom said in the interview that aired Wednesday on ABC News Live.\n\nThe governor slammed Trump for his policy actions but expressed more anger at the trolling Trump has done on social media and in interviews.\n\nThe two-term Democrat cited the president posting a photoshopped image of himself as the Pope and Superman and on Mount Rushmore as some of the wildest examples.\n\nNewsom said he's countering the president by putting \"a mirror up to Trump and his childishness\" through his own social media trolling over the last few months. The governor has posted images on his social media accounts belittling Trump's appearance on a Time magazine cover, and another that depicted the president as Marie Antoinette.\n\n\"To put a mirror up to this absurdity to call people out for their complicity. I mean, this is the president of the United States. These are mirroring what he has done, and people have allowed this to be normalized,\" he said.\n\nNewsom said he's not worried about retribution from the president, noting that Trump has already punished California by cutting back on federal funding for projects such as high-speed rail.\n\n\"He's gone after us like no other state, and that's when [his and Trump's] state of mind was collaborative,\" he noted.\n\nStill, the governor said that he and Trump get along \"extraordinarily well,\" particularly in past private conversations.\n\n\"He doesn't want interpersonal confrontation. Rare is that the case,\" Newsom said.\n\n\"But he'll attack in public when you're not there,\" Karl asked.\n\n\"Yeah, and then he'll lie about things,\" the governor responded. \"There's nothing except it's not. It's more the same.\"\n\nNewsom reflected on how the Democrats lost last year's election and some of their missteps, including handling the border. The governor noted there was a \"point of real friction\" between the Biden administration and himself and other governors who saw an influx of migrants.\n\n\"As I was working with the Biden administration, I said, 'You need to wake up to what's going on,'\" he said.\n\n\"Folks in Colorado, in Illinois and New York and elsewhere were expressing that frustration. I think we took the wrong lessons from the midterm where we overperformed, and that was a tactical mistake, but it's also wrong, period, on policy,\" he added.\n\nNewsom remained confident about the future of his party, saying that it is \"now appearing to be back on their toes, not their heels.\" He pushed other leaders to aggressively stand up to Trump as he continues to \"attack every single institution of independent thinking.\"\n\n\"[Trump is] succeeding because we're still playing by the old set of rules. And so my party needs to focus first and foremost on recognizing that. And then we'll reconcile, be more culturally normal, more reform-oriented, talk about service and patriotism,\" he said.",

    "title": "AP Decision Notes: What to expect in California's special election",
    "body": "WASHINGTON -- Led by Gov. Gavin Newsom, California Democrats are charging toward a new congressional map that could flip as many as five U.S. House seats from Republican to Democratic control. But first, they need voters to sign off.\n\nCalifornia voters head to the polls on Tuesday with just one yes-or-no question on the ballot. Passing Proposition 50 would implement a new congressional map, which passed the state legislature in August, for the next three election cycles. After the 2030 U.S. Census, the state's independent redistricting commission would resume drawing maps.\n\nPoliticians around the country are reshaping congressional voting districts -- a task typically done just once a decade, after each census -- in an effort to give their parties' candidates an edge in next year's elections. The national battle over partisan gerrymandering began in Texas, after a push from President Donald Trump. The Republican-controlled state adopted a new map in August that could flip five Democratic-leaning U.S. House seats. California was the second state to make moves. Between the California legislature passing the map and this election, Missouri and North Carolina both adopted new maps. Other states may soon follow.\n\nThe outcome of this ballot measure could help determine control of the U.S. House after the 2026 midterm elections, which will see Republicans try to buck a historical pattern of the president's party losing seats in midterm elections. The GOP's margin is slim: Heading into Tuesday's election, Republicans control 219 seats to Democrats' 213, with three vacancies.\n\nIf Prop 50 is approved, it's possible the Democrats could control as many as 48 of California's 52 congressional seats, up from the 43 seats the party now holds. In some cases, the recast districts would slice across California, with one uniting rural, conservative-leaning northern California with Marin County, a liberal coastal stronghold north of San Francisco. In others, district lines are left unchanged or have only minor adjustments.\n\nPartisans have lined up on both sides of the measure, which has seen well over $200 million in contributions.\n\nIf support for the ballot measure breaks along partisan lines -- which is not a guarantee -- the Democratic-backed \"Yes\" side would be favored to pass. The Democratic Party has a statewide voter registration advantage of more than 4.5 million voters, and Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris won California by around 20 percentage points last fall.\n\nOpponents of the measure, which include major Republican figures from the state ranging from former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy to potentially affected representatives, have reported raising more than $80 million. National Republicans are kicking in: The Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC dedicated to electing Republicans to the U.S. House of Representatives, has kicked in $5 million.\n\nThe \"No\" on 50 campaign also benefited from the high-profile involvement of former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, one of the last Republicans to win statewide office and a longtime opponent of gerrymandering. They're framing the initiative as a scheme by Democrats to boost their own influence and circumvent the voter-approved independent redistricting commission.\n\nBut the \"No\" campaign is shorter on cash than its opponents. The \"Yes\" side has raised around $138 million, according to data from the California secretary of state's office. And data from AdImpact, the nonpartisan advertising tracker, indicates the \"No\" side's ad spending has slowed to a trickle in the lead-up to the election.\n\nNewsom and both national and statewide Democrats have been very involved in advocating for the measure. Newsom contributed $2.6 million of his own campaign funds, while the House Majority PAC, an independent expenditure group backing Democratic House candidates, put in almost $15 million.\n\nThe Associated Press does not make projections and will declare a winner only when it's determined there is no scenario that would allow the trailing candidates to close the gap. If a race has not been called, the AP will continue to cover any newsworthy developments, such as candidate concessions or declarations of victory. In doing so, the AP will make clear that it has not yet declared a winner and explain why.\n\nThere are no automatic recounts in California. Any registered California voter may request a recount, but the voter or campaign committee represented by the voter requesting the recount must pay for it. The AP may declare a winner in a race that is eligible for a recount if it determines the lead is too large for a recount or legal challenge to change the outcome.\n\nHere's a look at what to expect:\n\nCalifornia's special election will be held Tuesday, though mail-in voting has been available for weeks. Polls close at 8 p.m. PT, or 11 p.m. ET.\n\nThe AP will provide vote results and declare the winner in the redistricting ballot measure.\n\nAny voter registered in California may participate in the special election.\n\nAs of Sept. 5, there were about 23.1 million registered voters in California. Of those, 45% were Democrats and 25% were Republicans. About 5.2 million voters were not registered with any party.\n\nTurnout in the 2021 gubernatorial recall, an off-year election in which that statewide vote was the only contest on the ballot, was about 58%.\n\nAs of Oct. 28, a total of 4.74 million ballots had been cast before Election Day. See the AP Early Vote Tracker for the latest update.\n\nIn the 2024 presidential election, the AP first reported results in California at 11:12 p.m. ET, or 12 minutes after polls closed. The vote tabulation ended for the night at 7:00 a.m. ET with about 54% of total votes counted.\n\nAs of Tuesday, there will be 364 days until the 2026 midterm elections and 1,099 days until the 2028 general election.",

    "body": "The total purchase price for the land was not immediately made public.\n\nIn the scrub-brush foothills between the long flat fields of the San Joaquin Valley and the mighty peaks and Sequoia forests of the Sierra Nevada, state leaders and elders from the Tule River Indian Tribe gathered Wednesday to mark the return of 17,000 acres of ancestral land to Tule River Indian tribe.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom's office called it \"the largest ancestral land return in the history of the region and a major step in addressing historical wrongs against California Native American tribes.\"\n\nThe former cattle ranches, one known as the \"Hershey Ranch\" and the other as the \"Carothers Ranch,\" include grasslands, oak woodlands and dark evergreen forests. They sit just south of the 55,000-acre Tule River reservation and abut the Giant Sequoia National Monument. They were purchased in 2024 and 2025 with support of the private funders, the Conservation Fund, and the California Natural Resources Agency's Tribal Nature-Based Solutions program, which uses state bond funds to return ancestral lands to tribes.\n\nThe program has awarded more than $107 million to support the return of tens of thousands of acres of land to California tribes, including 10,000 acres for the Hoopa Valley tribe to acquire the headwaters of Pine Creek, a tributary of the Klamath River. The initiative is part of a state plan to conserve 30% of lands and coastal waters by 2030 and are also part of what the governor's office calls a \"first-in-the-nation effort to address historical wrongs committed against California Native American tribes.\"\n\nThe Tule River acquisition restores some of the tribe's sacred homeland, and will enable a host of conservation projects, including protecting the Deer Creek watershed, protecting habitat for California condors and reintroducing tule elk. The tribe last year worked with state officials to reintroduce beavers to the south fork of the Tule River.\n\n\"This land return demonstrates the very essence of tribal land restoration, which expands access to essential food and medicinal resources,\" said Lester R. Nieto Jr. \"Shine\", Chairman, Tule River Tribal Council in a statement. Nieto added that the tribe \"envisions this land located in the Yowlumne Hills as a place to gather, heal, and simply be\" and that it is part of the tribe's \"long history of asserting and affirming its sovereignty.\"\n\nIn his own statement, Newsom said that \"the historical wrongs committed by the state against the Native people of this land echo through the natural worlds of California ecosystems that lost their first and best stewards.\" He added that the land return celebrated Wednesday \"marks a critical step in deepening the relationship between the state and the Tule River Indian Tribe.\"\n\nState officials said funds for the purchase included $7.75 million from the Tribal Nature Based Solutions program, $2.4 million from the Wildlife Conservation Board and a \"sizable amount\" from private philanthropy. The total purchase price was not immediately available.",

    "title": "Gavin Newsom is part of a disgusting new trend: Privileged people...",
    "body": "Gavin Newsom raised himself on the mean streets of Marin County, California.\n\n\"It was also about paying the bills, man,\" he recently told former NBA stars Stephen Jackson and Matt Barnes on their popular \"All the Smoke\" podcast.\n\n\"It was just, like, hustling. And and so I was out there kind of raising myself, turning on the TV, just getting obsessed. I was sitting there with the Wonder bread [and] macaroni and cheese.\"\n\nLike Steve Martin in \"The Jerk,\" Newsom apparentlystarted out as a poor black child.\n\nEven Jackson laughed, saying it sounded like his own biography.\n\nBut it's a fabricated \"poorigin\" story for the ages.\n\nNewsom left out a few key details in the portrayal of himself as a downtrodden latchkey kid who used sports to overcome his learning disability and go from stacks of Wonder bread to the French Laundry.\n\nThe 58-year-old comes from a prominent Bay Area family. His father was a judge and attorney. Sure, his parents were divorced, and he was mostly raised by his mother, Tessa. She, like many people in America, worked more than one job.\n\nBut unlike most kids, Newsom was close to the nexus of power. Early on, he was mentored by political kingmaker Willie Brown and both his professional and political ambitions were financed by the Getty oil dynasty -- his dad managed the billionaire family's trust.\n\nBut hey, he was just hustlin' and hooping his way out of trouble -- all while looking like the rich d-bag in every 1980s movie.\n\nNewsom is a shameless chameleon who will morph into whatever persona pleases his present company.\n\nWhen he interviewed Charlie Kirk for his \"This Is Gavin Newsom\" podcast in March, six months before the Turning Point founder's assassination, Newsom turned fawning: saying that his son was so pumped, he wanted to play hooky from school to meet Kirk.\n\nThis week, Newsom was asked on CNN how his son reacted to Kirk's death. The California governor back-pedaled, saying his son \"wasn't a fan of him as much as he was familiar with him.\"\n\nThe slick pretty boy is no fool. He's laying the groundwork for a presidential run in 2028 and reading the room.\n\nHe's also showcasing a major plot twist in America.\n\nSuddenly, there is this belief that to be somebody in the future, you had to have been a no one in the past. No access. No silver spoon in your mouth, and no advantages.\n\nIt's why the phrase \"nepo baby\" has become the most withering label. Even established, wealthy stars want to unburden themselves of their privilege.\n\nIt's why elites lean into victimhood, hoping it will absolve being born on third base.\n\nSometimes it's annoying but harmless. Meghan Markle, the daughter of a Daytime Emmy-winning lighting director, lamenting how she \"grew up on the $4.99 salad bar at Sizzler.\" Or Victoria Beckham claiming in the \"Beckham\" documentary that her childhood was \"very working class\" -- before her incredulous husband admonished her to \"be honest\" and admit her father drove a Rolls-Royce.\n\nBut things get murkier when it's politicians scrubbing their real lives in service of the idea that the only virtue is in struggle and getting your hands dirty. Or, in the case of Kamala Harris, getting french-fry grease on your shirt from working at McDonald's.\n\nTeam Harris thought that would be a clever way to dirty up her resume and make her more relatable to working folks.\n\nThe Democrats used to be the party of the working class before abandoning them. In a bid to rebuild an out-of-touch brand, party leaders are overcompensating by clinging to any shred of a blue-collar existence.\n\nLook at their next great hope, Graham Platner -- the self-professed \"working class\" man now running for a US Senate seat in Maine. (You know, the one who allegedly has a Nazi tattoo.) The Washington Post crowned him one of its \"rugged guys of the 2026 midterms\" while foodie mag Bon Appetit wrote about \"How Graham Platner Went From Working-Class Oysterman to Maine's Zohran Mamdani.\"\n\nPlease.\n\nPlatner's father was a prominent attorney in Maine. As a kid, the candidate briefly attended Hotchkiss prep academy -- a place so pricey the tuition could secure a down payment on a home.\n\nAnd, of course, there is Mamdani, the son of a Columbia professor and an Oscar-nominated director, who downplays his family's wealth and masquerades as a workingman's savior rather than the champagne socialist he is.\n\nThe great irony is that Donald Trump, a billionaire, has charmed the working class by flaunting his tax bracket. He knows how rich people act because he's one of them, and he's sharing the secrets.\n\nStuck in an identity crisis, the Dems are struggling to find authenticity and common sense.\n\nBut no one needs to be insulted by a guy like Newsom reimagining himself as a man of the people. Americans are smarter than that.",

    "body": "California's laws have made children its least protected class.\n\nAs a matter of fact, if an American state wanted to establish a formal means of separating children from parents and other loving caregivers to feed a profitable industry, it couldn't be done with much more effectiveness than in California.\n\nIn 2023, Gov. Gavin Newsom signed legislation requiring foster parents to \"affirm\" the LGBTQ identities of any children in their care.\n\nNaturally he hailed it as a giant leap forward for gay rights -- but it effectively kicked committed religious believers out of the foster-care system.\n\nLast month, the governor signed AB 495, aka the legal kidnapping bill, which allows an unrelated adult to claim a \"mentoring relationship\" and exercise parental authority over any child.\n\nNewsom's cronies in the Legislature touted it as a protection for the children of undocumented immigrants who might get whisked away by ICE in the middle of the day -- but it effectively put an end to parents' rights.\n\nThen there's SB 357, which bars police from profiling underage prostitutes.\n\nThis was designed to loosen the legal hassles surrounding \"sex work\" (as the progressives call it, because sex seems like a job to them) and supposedly spare some unfortunate young women an early criminal record.\n\nPerhaps you're beginning to see a pattern here.\n\nSo it should come as no surprise that in California, the trafficking of children is now booming.\n\nThis week, a New York Times report blew the lid off the Los Angeles child sex-trafficking corridor known as The Blade.\n\nPre-teen prostitutes have become so common, their numbers growing so quickly, that local law-enforcement officers have their own name for it: the \"Kiddie Stroll.\"\n\nThe Kiddie Stroll is no accident: It's not the sad but inevitable result of industrial progress; it's not even a function of poverty.\n\nThe Kiddie Stroll is California's opus, the logical result of its most effective social programming -- a disaster crafted over years and decades by politicians and others who understood that patience is a virtue, even for those with no virtue.\n\nEvery law supposedly meant to protect children in the state of California does the opposite. Every last one leads to this.\n\nLeave the border open for cartel coyotes to traffic humans without opposition.\n\nCreate a cultural distrust of parents, labeling them \"difficult\" or '\"abusive\" if they question gender or sexual confusion in their children.\n\nDrive caring, religious foster parents out of an already strained system, leaving more children vulnerable and alone.\n\nLower the age of consent. Lower it again.\n\nStop prosecuting violent crime. Stop prosecuting prostitution.\n\nLimit cops' and prosecutors' ability to identify criminal behavior and victims.\n\nStop labeling prostitution the heinous crime it is; start innocuously calling it \"sex work\" instead.\n\nMake it as easy as possible for any adult to wield legal control over a child.\n\nThen wait for the culture to accept the degradation as normal.\n\nWith this nearly perfect formula, the progressive left in California has done the impossible in a nation that nearly destroyed itself over slavery: They have brought it back.\n\nHow ironic, in a state where slavery was never legal -- yet where Democrats have waged an internal battle over reparations.\n\nMake no mistake about it, this is slavery.\n\nAnd just like in the days of the old South, it has government lurking behind every policy and every terrible consequence.\n\nThis is the calculated sale of vulnerable humans -- children, in this horrific case -- into the service of other humans, with the government's deliberate aid.\n\nIs it any wonder the leaders of the Democratic Party in California and across the country show no apparent concern that 300,000 children went missing when they crossed the border during the Biden administration?\n\nIf Gavin Newsom and his Legislature had deliberately set out to resurrect the slave trade in California, would they have done anything differently? Would Joe Biden?\n\nThe Kiddie Stroll is not the bug. It is the feature.\n\nIt is the hideous sculpture revealed to our unsuspecting eyes after years and years of progressive chipping and chiseling away at the edges of the law -- a monstrous tribute to the evil that has been boiling and bubbling underneath our amber waves of grain for 70 years or more.\n\nCalifornia's Kiddie Stroll is more than just a tragic tale of crime and poverty.\n\nIt is a 21st century slave trade, and the fact that it exists and thrives in California is nothing short of evil.\n\nShame on all of them.",

    "body": "WASHINGTON (AP) -- Led by Gov. Gavin Newsom, California Democrats are charging toward a new congressional map that could flip as many as five U.S. House seats from Republican to Democratic control. But first, they need voters to sign off.\n\nCalifornia voters head to the polls on Tuesday with just one yes-or-no question on the ballot. Passing Proposition 50 would implement a new congressional map, which passed the state legislature in August, for the next three election cycles. After the 2030 U.S. Census, the state's independent redistricting commission would resume drawing maps.\n\nPoliticians around the country are reshaping congressional voting districts -- a task typically done just once a decade, after each census -- in an effort to give their parties' candidates an edge in next year's elections. The national battle over partisan gerrymandering began in Texas, after a push from President Donald Trump. The Republican-controlled state adopted a new map in August that could flip five Democratic-leaning U.S. House seats. California was the second state to make moves. Between the California legislature passing the map and this election, Missouri and North Carolina both adopted new maps. Other states may soon follow.\n\nThe outcome of this ballot measure could help determine control of the U.S. House after the 2026 midterm elections, which will see Republicans try to buck a historical pattern of the president's party losing seats in midterm elections. The GOP's margin is slim: Heading into Tuesday's election, Republicans control 219 seats to Democrats' 213, with three vacancies.\n\nIf Prop 50 is approved, it's possible the Democrats could control as many as 48 of California's 52 congressional seats, up from the 43 seats the party now holds. In some cases, the recast districts would slice across California, with one uniting rural, conservative-leaning northern California with Marin County, a liberal coastal stronghold north of San Francisco. In others, district lines are left unchanged or have only minor adjustments.\n\nPartisans have lined up on both sides of the measure, which has seen well over $200 million in contributions.\n\nIf support for the ballot measure breaks along partisan lines -- which is not a guarantee -- the Democratic-backed \"Yes\" side would be favored to pass. The Democratic Party has a statewide voter registration advantage of more than 4.5 million voters, and Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris won California by around 20 percentage points last fall.\n\nOpponents of the measure, which include major Republican figures from the state ranging from former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy to potentially affected representatives, have reported raising more than $80 million. National Republicans are kicking in: The Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC dedicated to electing Republicans to the U.S. House of Representatives, has kicked in $5 million.\n\nThe \"No\" on 50 campaign also benefited from the high-profile involvement of former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, one of the last Republicans to win statewide office and a longtime opponent of gerrymandering. They're framing the initiative as a scheme by Democrats to boost their own influence and circumvent the voter-approved independent redistricting commission.\n\nBut the \"No\" campaign is shorter on cash than its opponents. The \"Yes\" side has raised around $138 million, according to data from the California secretary of state's office. And data from AdImpact, the nonpartisan advertising tracker, indicates the \"No\" side's ad spending has slowed to a trickle in the lead-up to the election.\n\nNewsom and both national and statewide Democrats have been very involved in advocating for the measure. Newsom contributed $2.6 million of his own campaign funds, while the House Majority PAC, an independent expenditure group backing Democratic House candidates, put in almost $15 million.\n\nThe Associated Press does not make projections and will declare a winner only when it's determined there is no scenario that would allow the trailing candidates to close the gap. If a race has not been called, the AP will continue to cover any newsworthy developments, such as candidate concessions or declarations of victory. In doing so, the AP will make clear that it has not yet declared a winner and explain why.\n\nThere are no automatic recounts in California. Any registered California voter may request a recount, but the voter or campaign committee represented by the voter requesting the recount must pay for it. The AP may declare a winner in a race that is eligible for a recount if it determines the lead is too large for a recount or legal challenge to change the outcome.\n\nHere's a look at what to expect:\n\nCalifornia's special election will be held Tuesday, though mail-in voting has been available for weeks. Polls close at 8 p.m. PT, or 11 p.m. ET.\n\nThe AP will provide vote results and declare the winner in the redistricting ballot measure.\n\nAny voter registered in California may participate in the special election.\n\nAs of Sept. 5, there were about 23.1 million registered voters in California. Of those, 45% were Democrats and 25% were Republicans. About 5.2 million voters were not registered with any party.\n\nTurnout in the 2021 gubernatorial recall, an off-year election in which that statewide vote was the only contest on the ballot, was about 58%.\n\nAs of Oct. 28, a total of 4.74 million ballots had been cast before Election Day. See the AP Early Vote Tracker for the latest update.\n\nIn the 2024 presidential election, the AP first reported results in California at 11:12 p.m. ET, or 12 minutes after polls closed. The vote tabulation ended for the night at 7 a.m. ET with about 54% of total votes counted.\n\nAs of Tuesday, there will be 364 days until the 2026 midterm elections and 1,099 days until the 2028 general election.",

    "body": "A highly contentious issue is in the hands of voters in California. Eligible residents are going to the polls in a special election Nov. 4 to decide whether to approve Proposition 50 -- a proposal to temporarily redraw the state's congressional district lines.\n\nThe Golden State hopes to offset a move by Texas that was designed to create more Republican seats in the House of Representatives in next year's midterm elections.\n\nIf passed, California Gov. Gavin Newsom hopes more Democratic seats will be gained in the 2026, 2028, and 2030 elections.\n\nCalifornia voters who mark their ballot \"yes\" are saying they want California to redraw its congressional districts to give Democrats a potential advantage in the US House of Representatives.\n\n\"No\" voters are saying they want California's congressional district lines to remain as they were drawn by the state's nonpartisan citizen redistricting commission.\n\nBut just like the division of politics, it's pitting neighborhood against neighborhood.\n\nA Berkshire Hathaway heir has poured millions of dollars to fight Newsom's redistricting plan. Charlie Munger Jr. has spent millions of his late father's money to stop the plan he says will \"gerrymander\" the state in favor of Democrats.\n\nIn an op-ed for The New York Times, Munger wrote, \"Gerrymanders are a cancer, and mid-decade gerrymanders are a metastasis.\"\n\nIn certain parts of California, concerns stem from district lines that would be redrawn affecting neighboring rural and urban areas.\n\nFor example, in San Diego County, the rural town of Lakeside has a population of nearly 22,000, according to Data USA, and is represented by longtime Republican Rep. Darrell Issa. The nearby city of El Cajon, with a population of 106,000, is represented by Democratic Rep. Sara Jacobs. The November ballot measure would temporarily draw new House maps that would join the rural and urban communities, according to CalMatters.\n\n\"I don't like that they're changing that and lumping us in the urban areas,\" Fredrich Bahrke, a 65-year-old former Naval officer who lives in Lakeside, told the publication. \"It's going to put us in a district with people with very different views in our area.\"\n\nJessica Vance, a San Diego real estate agent, says she has noticed buyers are quietly factoring in neighborhood governance and culture. \"While very few people buy a home because of district maps, they are more aware that representation and community identity can influence long term value,\" Vance tells Realtor.com®.\n\nShe explains that the redistricting debate isn't at the top of the list for her clients, but she recognizes how it can subtly impact a neighborhood's desirability.\n\n\"Redrawing district maps can change which communities feel well-represented, what public investments they expect, and how a neighborhood even feels,\" Vance explains.\n\nRealtor.com senior economist Jake Krimmel notes that \"usually, a discussion of home values and maps centers on school districts or municipal boundaries. And this is for good reason: Things like good schools, safer streets, well-maintained parks and public spaces, and lower property taxes can all increase home values.\n\n\"Families are willing to pay more to enjoy these local public goods and services, and typically you have to live within certain catchment areas (e.g., school districts or city boundaries) to do so.\"\n\nAs it stands, the September median list price for San Diego County is $948,500, with homes spending a median 49 days on the market. Buyers across the state are paying some of the most expensive home prices in the country.\n\n\"Cities that gain stronger representation or remain politically aligned with local priorities could see a small boost in home values. On the other hand, areas that feel politically marginalized may experience softer demand,\" Vance says.\n\nKrimmel says, \"If some representatives are able to bring back more federal dollars to their district, that could certainly improve quality of life and property values. Infrastructure projects and other forms of local economic development could be key here.\"\n\nCalifornia isn't alone in the redistricting debate.\n\nThe Lone Star State made national headlines in August when state lawmakers fled to avoid voting on a Republican redistricting plan. They eventually returned to Texas and, in the end, Gov. Greg Abbott signed a new congressional map into law that all but secures an additional five Republican-leaning House districts seats.\n\nRedistricting has been going on in other states as well ahead of next year's midterms, as both parties are looking for ways to gain or maintain control of the House. As it stands, it's a slim margin with Democrats needing three seats to take control.\n\nMonday, some New York voters filed a lawsuit against the state challenging its congressional map and claiming \"racial vote dilution.\" The lawsuit comes as New York City is in the final stretch of a highly contested race for mayor.\n\nDemocrat Zohran Mamdani leads independent Andrew Cuomo and Republican Curtis Sliwa with housing as one of the hottest topics.\n\nIn Missouri, lawmakers are pushing for a revised US House map that could potentially give Republicans a better advantage.\n\nNorth Carolina lawmakers approved a new district map that could potentially unseat a Democratic incumbent. Utah is also trying to redistrict its maps.\n\nIn Virginia and Colorado, Democratic leaders are pushing for new map lines to be drawn. Republicans in Indiana, Nebraska, and Kansas are also in favor of redistricting.\n\nOhio will have new congressional districts for next year's midterm elections because the current congressional map expires in 2026 and state lawmakers are required by law to redraw the districts this year.\n\nStates typically redraw their congressional districts following a US census every 10 years.",

    "body": "California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) has said he shares profound concern about the possibility of President Donald Trump clinging to power beyond the conclusion of his second term, even though the U.S. Constitution explicitly prohibits it.\n\nWhile the president told reporters Wednesday, \"it's pretty clear\" the 22nd Amendment does not allow him to pursue another White House bid in 2028, both Trump and his allies have previously seemed eager to explore the possibility.\n\nTrump has been selling 2028 merchandise, and as recently as Monday, he hasn't explicitly ruled out a third term.\n\n\"I haven't really thought about it. I have the best poll numbers I've ever had,\" he said at the time, but added, \"Am I not ruling it out? I mean, you'll have to tell me.\"\n\nIn an interview with ABC's Jonathan Karl set to be released in full on Wednesday, Newsom said there's a method behind Trump's third term talk.\n\n\"I don't think [Trump] takes himself seriously, but he iterates. He throws things out. And he plays with it, and he sees how people react, and it manifests. Meaning, once a mind is stretched, it never goes back to its original form. And that's my concern,\" Newsom told Karl.\n\nNewsom also singled out Steve Bannon, a longtime Trump insider who recently told The Economist, \"there's a plan\" for Trump to be president in 2028, as a potentially dangerous force fueling the president's ambitions for power.\n\n\"I'm deeply concerned about it, and guys like Bannon, they're not screwing around,\" Newsom told ABC News. \"They're not screwing around.\"\n\nNewsom, who has been relentlessly slamming the president and his policies on social media, has admitted that he is mulling a 2028 presidential bid, confirming his ambitions extend beyond California as he is set to leave the governor's mansion in Sacramento in January 2027 due to term limits.",

    "body": "Redistricting fervor is gripping our states' capitals, as red states and blue states one-up each other in a mid-decade battle to redraw congressional lines.\n\nWhen red Texas and Missouri unveiled redistricting plans in recent months, blue states retaliated.\n\nCalifornians are voting on Proposition 50, a measure pushed by Gov. Gavin Newsom to end-run the state's legally mandated nonpartisan mapping commission.\n\nThe redistricting plan threatened by New York Gov. Kathy Hochul faced steep constitutional challenges, so Democrats this week filed a lawsuit against the city's single Republican, declaring the improperly drawn lines.\n\nIn the coming months, an expected Supreme Court ruling on the Voting Rights Act could set off another scramble.\n\nAnd while some or all of these changes may affect the 2026 midterm elections, they've got nothing on the massive political shift just around the corner: the 2030 US Census reapportionment.\n\nAs millions of Americans flee big blue-state governments, the next reapportionment will force an unprecedented transformation of both presidential campaigning and the makeup of the House of Representatives.\n\nMajor budget, economic, and social consequences will follow.\n\nPopulation losses have cost Democrats electoral votes in their big states of New York and Illinois since World War II, but have been offset by California's postwar population surge.\n\nOnce it turned blue in 1992, California's electoral vote total peaked in 2000 and has declined since.\n\nMeanwhile, Texas has grown exponentially: It now has the nation's second-largest Electoral College delegation, while Florida's has skyrocketed to the third-largest today.\n\nThis substantial and ongoing migration means the 2030 reapportionment could shift six to 12 electoral votes from blue states to red ones, upending traditional strategies in presidential contests.\n\nFor Republicans, for example, it could end the importance of recent swing states of Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Nevada.\n\nNone of them will be needed for the GOP to secure an Electoral College win if just nine electoral votes shift to red states in 2030 and Republicans retain their traditional strongholds.\n\nMeanwhile, Democrats would need all these swing states, plus Iowa, to win the White House.\n\nIn the House, reapportionment could have a similar effect, but the shift is less certain.\n\nTexas, for example, redistricted this year because its last attempt after the 2020 reapportionment backfired.\n\nThe Lone Star State gained two seats, but its legislature approved a redistricting plan that protected incumbent Republicans' congressional seats rather than adding to the GOP's total.\n\nMeanwhile, states like Illinois gerrymandered so effectively after the 2020 reapportionment that in 2024, Republicans won only 18% of the Prairie State's House seats, even though the GOP won an incredible 47% of its House votes.\n\nWhen the 2030 reapportionment shifts the swing states in the presidential election, the nation's swing voters will shift along with them.\n\nAfter 2020's reapportionment, the swing states remained the Rust Belt, and their swing votes were industrial workers.\n\nThat goes a long way toward explaining President Donald Trump's focus on protecting and expanding manufacturing jobs.\n\nWhen Rust Belt states are no longer the squeaky wheel, new swing states will grab the political spotlight -- with Iowa at the top of the list.\n\nExpect agriculture issues to dominate politically once again, and look for Democrats to restore Iowa as the first-in-the-nation caucus.\n\nWith successful redistricting, growing states with no or low income taxes should control the federal levers.\n\nThat means the special-interest provisions subsidizing blue states, such as the SALT cap allowing federal deductions of state and local taxes, could be eliminated.\n\nTexas and Florida, which spend roughly $1,550 per Medicaid enrollee, won't abide federal subsidies for New York's $4,942 per enrollee.\n\nMeans-tested welfare spending, which has grown by 150% in real terms since 2000, will face tighter controls under the House's new Republican domination.\n\nThe Republicans' good fortunes in the House and White House would not extend to the Senate. Yet with reconciliation, Senate Republicans could cut taxes and spending.\n\nWith enhanced Republican influence on appropriations and on legislation regarding regulations, union rules and education bureaucracies, Democrats will soon become the Senate's most fervent supporters of the legislative filibuster.\n\nThe Founding Fathers deserve credit for this looming transformation -- along with Gresham's law, the economic principle that \"bad money drives out good.\"\n\nThe Constitution's 10th Amendment, declaring that all powers not specifically granted to the federal government are reserved for the states, made states the laboratories of American democracy.\n\nAmericans have been given a choice: between economic growth and opportunity in low-tax, low-spending states on the one hand, and expansive welfare benefits in high-tax, big-spending states on the other.",

    "body": "In a press event launching a lawsuit against the Trump administration over SNAP benefits Tuesday, Gov. Gavin Newsom cited Scripture as evidence the government should feed the hungry. (Credit: Handout)\n\nA coalition of 25 Democratic governors and attorneys general on Tuesday sued the Trump administration over its refusal to fund the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits during the ongoing government shutdown -- arguing that a suspension of the aid threatens to disproportionately harm millions of vulnerable and low-income Americans.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed in Massachusetts, asks a federal judge to force the U.S. Department of Agriculture to release a portion of the $9.2 billion in SNAP benefits allocated for the month of November.\n\nThe Trump administration said Friday that it would not use the Agriculture Department's roughly $5 billion contingency fund to cover the food stamp benefits provided by SNAP for the month of November. Instead, they said, the agency is planning to keep it on hand to respond to natural disasters.\n\nSENATE GOP DIVIDED AS MILLIONS RISK LOSING FOOD AID IN SHUTDOWN STANDOFF\n\nStates warned in the lawsuit Tuesday that halting the SNAP payments, even in the near-term, threatens disproportionate harm for the roughly 42 million Americans that currently receive SNAP aid beginning on Nov. 1, when the food assistance is slated to expire.\n\n\"Shutting off SNAP benefits will cause deterioration of public health and well-being,\" state leaders said in the lawsuit.\n\n\"Ultimately, states will bear costs associated with many of these harms,\" they added. \"The loss of SNAP benefits leads to food insecurity, hunger, and malnutrition, which are associated with numerous negative health outcomes in children, such as poor concentration, decreased cognitive function, fatigue, depression, and behavioral problems.\"\n\nNEW YORK ATTORNEY GENERAL LETITIA JAMES ENTERS PLEA IN FEDERAL MORTGAGE FRAUD CASE\n\nThe lawsuit was filed by a coalition of attorneys general and governors from Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, D.C., Hawaii, Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin.\n\nIn the near-term, the states asked U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani, the federal judge in Massachusetts assigned to the case, to order the Trump administration to release the USDA contingency funds to help ensure there is not a lapse in SNAP program benefits beginning Nov. 1.\n\nJudge Talwani will hear from both parties during an emergency status hearing Wednesday,during which she will weigh the states' request for an emergency order to force USDA to release a portion of its emergency funds to SNAP recipients.\n\nSCHUMER AGAIN BLOCKS GOP BID TO REOPEN GOVERNMENT AS AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS GO UNPAID\n\nThe USDA, for its part, has not yet shared details on the policy decision or decision not to funnel the contingency funds to SNAP beneficiaries.\n\nA note on its website states simply that, \"[T]he well has run dry.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"At this time, there will be no benefits issued November 01,\" the agency said.",

    "title": "The push for reparations continues to conflict with equality and legal reality",
    "body": "It appears that reparations advocates who fail to learn from history are doomed to a repeat veto. For the second session in a row, Governor Gavin Newsom vetoed several reparations bills that would have provided benefits to California descendants of enslaved persons. For instance, the bill would have offered descendants of enslaved persons college admission preferences, priority licensing, compensation for property taken through racially motivated eminent domain, and dedicated home-buying assistance.\n\nAccording to a 2023 poll by the University of California, Berkeley, reparations are widely unpopular in the state, with only 23 percent of residents supporting cash payments to minority individuals. In his recent veto message, Newson commended the reparations bill's authors for seeking to fix \"historic injustices\", but said the state could not expend the \"immense resources\" necessary to implement the bill.\n\nAlthough stymied once again, the advocates are keen on making another attempt at the next legislative session. But given how challenging the legal landscape is for them, it's best for reparations supporters -- and for all citizens of the free state of California -- to accept their modest wins and quit while they feel somewhat ahead.\n\nThat's because the defeat of these bills is a victory for equal treatment under the law and another setback for government-sponsored racial discrimination. This outcome would have occurred eventually, even without a veto, due to California's Proposition 209 and the United States Supreme Court's 2023 decision in Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard.\n\nProp. 209 prevents the state from both discriminating against and giving preferences on the basis of race in public employment, education, and contracting. Further, the Supreme Court's decision in Students for Fair Admissions restrained race-based affirmative action in college admissions and hastened limitations on the government's power to racially discriminate under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.\n\nThe court clarified that racial distinctions by the government only apply in the rare instances that government is remedying specific instances of its past discriminatory conduct. And even then, the discriminatory remedy must be tailored to that conduct. Moreover, the government may never use an individual's race as a negative against him, nor can it use race to stereotype individuals.\n\nThe California reparations bills breach these legal limitations. Their benefits were based on race, rather than personal harm suffered due to specific discriminatory government conduct. As such, they would stereotype individuals as victims of discrimination based on their race and ancestry. In addition, it would disadvantage individuals with the wrong racial identities.\n\nTo circumvent constitutional limitations, reparations advocates argued that the benefits were lawfully tied to lineage or ancestry, rather than race. But as the Supreme Court previously instructed in Rice v. Cayetano, ancestry can be a proxy for race. Here, the reparations bills intended ancestry to be a proxy for race to benefit black Californians.\n\nThe bills were among the Black Legislative Caucus' \"Road to Repair 2025 Priority Bill Package,\" which was \"grounded in the recommendations put forth by the California Reparations Task Force.\" California formed the Task Force to study and develop reparations proposals specifically for African Americans. Bill sponsors and supporters unequivocally sought to address disparities that black Californians specifically face in various industries. The notion that these reparations were intended to benefit all descendants of chattel slavery regardless of race ignores the undeniable evidence to the contrary. This evidence would not go unnoticed by the courts.\n\nAnd even if these reparations distinguished race from lineage, they would still offend liberty and justice. Reparations would primarily benefit individuals who did not suffer the crimes committed several generations ago at the expense of those who did not commit them. No one today is a slave or a slave-owner, but California would treat its diverse residents as such based on the identity of their ancestors.\n\nNo one can control who their ancestors are, so it is unjust to let that control one's destiny. That is why the government cannot use discrimination based on race or ancestry to remedy injuries \"that may be ageless in its reach into the past, and timeless in their ability to affect the future.\"\n\nBut reparations advocates gained some ground this year in making present-day Californians answer for (or benefit from) the past. Newsom signed legislation establishing a new state agency to create a process for confirming the ancestry of descendants. He also signed a bill giving $6 million to the California State University to essentially do the same thing. Ultimately, reparations advocates won a government-run 23andMe or Ancestry.com.\n\nReparations advocates shouldn't go any further, nor can they, given the limits of the Constitution. These limits exist because of the history of the government's awful record with race. Our nation correctly learned from this history that \"Distinctions between citizens solely because of their ancestry are by their very nature odious to a free people whose institutions are founded upon the doctrine of equality.\"\n\nA third time won't be a charm for reparations advocates because the Constitution will not doom us to repeating a history we have fought hard to avoid.",

    "title": "California and Newsom mad-dog Trump with Proposition 50",
    "body": "Californians are on edge. And I'm not talking about the distressing government shutdown or the roiling World Series. I'm referring to the other big deal on the near-horizon: next Tuesday's vote on Proposition 50.\n\nIf you live here, you surely have formed an opinion on the partisan gerrymander proposal that Gov. Gavin Newsom and his allies have put on the Nov. 4 ballot. In their world, Prop. 50 is as righteous as a Roki Sasaki fastball and as pure the alpine air on Mount Whitney.\n\nIn short, the Pro-50 argument goes: California is standing up to give Democrats a fair playing field nationally by temporarily rejiggering congressional election lines in America's most populous state. To which President Trump, his allies and even some moderates essentially counter: You're breaking the state's rules for drawing bipartisan political maps and it's all an unfair ego-play that benefits only nutty leftists, like the Golden State's ambitious governor.\n\nIt seems to me it takes an act of fairly advanced myopia to argue that Newsom and Co. are up to something underhanded, when their redistricting has been hiding in plain sight. The maps have been public. The nature of the challenge (or \"threat\" to many Californians) has become self-evident. Does the biggest state stand idly by while Team Trump draws Republican-friendly maps in right-leaning states, to assure a GOP majority in the House of Representatives? Does California vie for the Lady Byng trophy (given annually to the most \"gentlemanly\" player in roughneck pro hockey) while Trumpers jettison (Constitutional) principles like Cruella de Vil?\n\nThe state's Democrats and even many centrists who tilt left have seen enough of Trump's relentless immigration raids, his disregard for the healthcare benefits of millions and his disdain for all things California. They have taken to mad-dogging a mad-dog administration. And they pledge that this will be only a temporary corrective, with the return of the state's bipartisan redistricting commission following the 2030 census.\n\nCalifornia Republicans, understandably, feel like they're about to lose an already slippery toehold on representation in California. To them, Prop. 50 amounts to pummeling an already abused minority party and stealing away as many as five House seats. But, oddly, I haven't heard them voice much concern about similar manipulation in other states, where Democrats stand to get the short end.\n\nThe Dems could lose as many as 17 seats nationwide because of all the partisan map-making, analysts have told The Times's political whiz, Mark Z. Barabak. That number remains in flux, because of ongoing action in Indiana and other states and legal challenges that could upend everything. A flip of that many seats could be huge in a law-making body in which the GOP has held as few as 219 votes, just one more than needed to pass legislation and the smallest majority in 95 years. The GOP edge would be even smaller if Speaker Mike Johnson (R-Louisiana) would stop slow-walking the swearing in of one Democrat elected in a special election to represent Arizona.\n\nAll this already has Californians on both side of the political chasm on high alert. Yet the president somehow (as he often does) found a way to ratchet up the anxiety. He did it by ordering election \"monitors\" to California, ostensibly to make sure scads of undocumented immigrants don't find a way to cast illegal ballots.\n\nThe president's intervention feels more like another provocation to Newsom and Atty. Gen. Rob Bonta, who already watched Trump ignore their pleas not to deploy the National Guard to abet his aggressive immigration raids. Democrats fear the election monitors will act more like obstructionists, potentially rejecting valid ballots to steal the election for the GOP.\n\nNewsom called the deployment of the observers to five counties -- Fresno, Kern, Los Angeles, Orange and Riverside -- an \"intimidation tactic,\" while Bonta predicted that the president will try to find an excuse after the election to once again play the \"election fraud\" card.\n\nWhile some will read the Prop. 50 outcome as a proxy for Newsom's viability in a 2028 presidential run, the governor insists it stands for a lot more. Newsom warned last week that Trump might send masked ICE agents to try to intimidate voters, in preparation for more misdeeds, as he builds \"the scaffolding for all across this country [for] next November's [midterm] election.\"\n\nCalifornia's 40th governor sounded a more hopeful note Tuesday as he described the 1.2 million contributors across America who raised $38 million for Prop. 50. But he said voters should assume nothing; presumably including polls showing Prop. 50 ahead. \"Don't think for a second we can run the 90-yard dash,\" the governor cautioned. \"This election is not over. So let's do everything in our power to focus on getting out the vote.\"\n\nEmail us at essentialcalifornia@latimes.com, and your response might appear in the newsletter this week.\n\nToday's great photo is from L.A.

    "title": "GOP previews 2028 attacks in shutdown messaging",
    "body": "CAMPAIGN FORESHADOWING -- As the shutdown standoff over health care funding drags on, GOP leaders are trying to rope one of California's signature policies into the debate.\n\nFor weeks, the Republicans' messaging has targeted health care for undocumented immigrants -- accusing congressional Democrats of demanding federal dollars flow to people in the country illegally as a condition of reopening the government, while separately charging California with exploiting a federal loophole to pay for its in-state program.\n\nThe attacks offer a preview of what Gov. Gavin Newsom -- who in 2022 approved a major expansion of the state's Medicaid program -- might expect if he enters the presidential race in 2028. California was the first state to offer health insurance to unauthorized immigrants of all ages with low incomes, and GOP figures have used the program's very existence to make the case that Democrats prioritize immigrants over U.S. citizens.\n\n\"It was Gavin Newsom who made this an issue by doing something no other state has done,\" said Rep. Kevin Kiley, a California Republican and frequent Newsom antagonist. \"It is an interesting contrast when you have all of these national (Democratic) political figures who are saying 'no no no, that's not something we would ever do.'\"\n\nDemocrats have condemned the Republican attacks as misleading or outright false, accusing them of conflating state and federal programs and noting the law prohibits federal dollars from flowing to undocumented immigrants. Newsom has repeatedly called the GOP out for what he calls bald-faced lies about California's program, which runs entirely on state funding -- a point echoed by New York Democrats.\n\nMore broadly, Newsom and fellow Democrats argue the GOP is trying to distract from its own record, distorting facts to shift the shutdown conversation away from unpopular health care cuts -- including the looming expiration of popular Obamacare subsidies, a central sticking point for Washington Democrats. The governor denounced Republicans' strategy as \"pathetic.\"\n\n\"It also shows how wrong they are, and the overwhelming now bipartisan opposition to these massive increases in health care costs that are going in effect in January,\" Newsom said. \"That's why they're desperate to paint a different picture.\"\n\nBut the GOP has a penchant for pivoting to immigration. And if 2020 and 2024 are any indication, it's likely to be a focus again in 2028. If Newsom is in the race, California's program is likely to come into the spotlight.\n\n\"Republicans are returning to an issue that's a winner to them: Any time they're talking about benefits for undocumented or illegal immigrants, that's a winner for them,\" said David Gilliard, a California-based Republican consultant.\n\nCalifornia's program has continually courted controversy. Newsom has defended it as fiscally wise and morally righteous. But he pared the initiative back this summer as soaring costs helped fuel a massive budget deficit, angering liberal supporters and vindicating Republican foes who had long called the idea unsustainable.\n\nThe political dynamics in Republican-controlled Washington are starkly different than in Democratic-dominated states like California. While a national Pew poll late last year found Americans overwhelmingly opposed offering public benefits to immigrants, California voters broadly favor extending coverage to the state's huge undocumented population. That support rose this summer as Trump threw a deportation dragnet over cities like Los Angeles.\n\nThere's a history there: In the 1990s, Republican Gov. Pete Wilson's push to cut off state aid to undocumented immigrants drew a stark dividing line in California's politics, helping to enshrine a semi-permanent Democratic majority by activating a generation of Latino voters and politicians like Sen. Alex Padilla.\n\n\"There was a general feeling for many years, post-Pete Wilson, that the Pete Wilson immigration attacks backfired on the (Republican) party,\" said Anthony Wright, who heads the health care advocacy organization Families USA and spent years advocating for universal insurance coverage in California. \"The temperature was turned down partially because they didn't want to fall into the trap they felt Pete Wilson did.\"\n\nFast forward 30 years and California's program even drew bipartisan support as recently as last year, with Republican then-Assemblymember Devon Mathis arguing it reduced cost pressures on straining rural hospitals. But Mathis said in an interview that the White House believes it is channeling the will of voters.\n\n\"This is another one of those 80/20 issues,\" Mathis said, \"where the Trump administration has figured out that people are tired of paying for people who aren't here legally.\"\n\nGOOD MORNING.

Listen to the trailer and subscribe on Apple, Spotify or wherever you get your podcasts.\n\nESSAYLI RULING -- A federal judge ruled Tuesday that Bill Essayli, the top federal prosecutor in Los Angeles, has been illegally serving in the role since July, Kyle Cheney and Josh Gerstein report.\n\nThe former Republican Assembly member left the Legislature in April after President Donald Trump picked him to serve in the role. But Essayli should have departed the post by July 31 under a 120-day limit imposed by federal law, U.S. District Judge J. Michael Seabright concluded.\n\nAn unusual maneuver by Attorney General Pam Bondi to extend Essayli's tenure into 2026 violated federal appointment laws, the Hawaii-based George W. Bush appointee ruled.\n\n\"Simply stated: Essayli unlawfully assumed the role of Acting United States Attorney for the Central District of California,\" Seabright concluded. \"Essayli may not perform the functions and duties of the United States Attorney ... He is disqualified from serving in that role.\"\n\nEssayli emphasized in a post on X that the ruling permits him to continue serving as the highest-ranking official in the office he oversaw, even if he can't hold the title of U.S. attorney.\n\n\"Nothing is changing,\" he wrote.\n\nEssayli did not address another possibility: Under federal law, the judges of the Central District of California could appoint some other attorney to fill the U.S. attorney post until Trump can get a nominee confirmed to the post.\n\nThe Justice Department declined to comment, while Sen. Adam Schiff criticized the Trump administration for leaving Essayli in place.\n\n\"'Unlawfully serving' in his role. Acting illegally. But left in place? While this Administration continues to replace career professionals with illegitimate political allies eager to do Trump's bidding, Californians need better relief than this,\" Schiff said in a statement.\n\nWITH VOTES TO SPARE -- More than half of likely voters are planning to support California Democrats' redistricting ballot measure next week, a new poll shows.\n\nThe survey from the Public Policy Institute found that, of the 56 percent of likely voters who plan to support the Nov. 4 measure, 95 percent disapprove of how Trump is handling his job, while 86 percent approve of Newsom's performance as governor. As Juliann Ventura reports, 43 percent of voters say they will be voting no on Proposition 50, according to the poll, which was conducted by Ipsos.\n\nRegardless of political party, nearly 70 percent of likely voters say that the outcome of the special election is \"very important\" to them.\n\nFIRST IN PLAYBOOK: AD ALERT -- Reproductive Freedom for All will today debut a new ad in support of Proposition 50, Democrats' Nov. 4 redistricting measure. The group said it's making a \"five-figure\" digital buy to target voters in the battleground districts of Republican Reps. Young Kim and David Valadao.\n\nThe spot argues that supporting Prop 50 will help \"defend reproductive freedom right now,\" a familiar argument that Democrats have deployed as they seek to convince voters that passing the measure will help put a check on Trump's policies and grip on power in Washington.\n\nCLAIM GAME -- Newsom and Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara have declared victory over the state's wildfire insurance availability crisis. But it's still spiraling, according to new data from the state's insurer of last resort that shows customers are still unable to find private insurance. Read last night's California Climate for the latest on the shadows still stalking the state's insurance market.\n\nTAKING A PASS -- The GOP's efforts to redraw congressional maps in red states before the midterm elections are hitting roadblocks from state-level Republicans. As Andrew Howard writes, Trump's team is finding there are some Republicans who simply won't budge -- despite threats and force -- on a legally questionable strategy that would grow the GOP's advantage in next year's fight to keep the House.\n\n\"Trump absolutely controls the national narrative on a day to day basis ... but politics continues to be local,\" said GOP operative Matthew Bartlett, a New Hampshire native. \"It's hard enough to run the show on the national level; good luck to you getting way into the details and weeds on a state level.\"\n\nBLAME GAME -- Several Democratic states are blaming Trump and Republicans in Congress for the government shutdown on government websites, as the funding cliff for the millions who rely on federally funded food aid -- which is known as SNAP -- rapidly approaches, write Jacob Wendler and Cheyanne M. Daniels.\n\nA POLITICO review of all 50 states and D.C.'s SNAP websites found that most have added notices to state webpages about federal benefits. But a handful of Democratic-controlled states -- Illinois, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania -- are using the sites to draw attention to their political opponents. California calls out the \"failures of Trump and Congress,\" which is under GOP control.\n\nSEE YOU IN COURT -- Florida's Attorney General James Uthmeier is once again taking California to court. On Tuesday, Uthmeier announced that he is asking the U.S. Supreme Court to take up a complaint that alleges California's tax system is unconstitutional and is calculated in a way that penalizes multi-state corporations that relocate. He also criticized Newsom in the announcement.\n\nAs Gary Fineout reports for subscribers, Uthmeier argues Florida has no other alternative way to challenge the tax rules being used by California than to file directly with the Supreme Court. Earlier this month, Uthmeier asked the Supreme Court to force California and Washington to stop issuing commercial driver's licenses to people who are not U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents.\n\nFIRED TO HIRED -- Newsom has hired Michele Beckwith, the former acting U.S. attorney in Sacramento who was fired by Trump, as a deputy legal affairs secretary, The New York Times reports. \"Michele brings to our office more than 20 years of legal experience and invaluable knowledge of the law,\" Tara Gallegos, a spokesperson for Newsom, told the Times. \"Trump's loss is California's gain.\"\n\nBOVINO BACKSTORY -- Gregory Bovino, Trump's top immigration enforcer charged with handpicking new leaders at ICE, first engaged his controversial tactics in California, the San Francisco Chronicle reports. His El Centro sector carried out \"Operation Return to Sender,\" a surprise January raid in Bakersfield that ensnared U.S. citizens, and he has been on the ground for several immigration raids in California and elsewhere.\n\n-- Trump's policy to slap a $100,000 fee on new H-1B visa applicants is punishing California and India at the same time, write Hoover Institution fellows Markos Kounalakis and Dinsha Mistree (San Francisco Examiner)\n\n-- Republican voters in Northern California are preparing to be represented by Democrats in Congress if Prop 50 passes.

The outlet noted that within days of Beckwith's firing, Bovino led a raid on a Home Depot parking lot during which at least eight were arrested for being in the U.S. illegally.\n\nAfter Beckwith's firing, Newsom's press office wrote on X, \"Trump has fired the top federal prosecutor in Sacramento because she insisted on following the law.

    "title": "Newsom thinks he can be president, but California's policies are killing people | Opinion",
    "body": "Former Vice President Kamala Harris and California Governor Gavin Newsom said they are considering 2028 presidential runs.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom finally admitted to what has been extremely obvious for some time: The Democrat wants to be president and is giving \"serious thought\" to a run for the White House in 2028.\n\n\"I'd be lying otherwise,\" Newsom said Oct. 26 on \"CBS News Sunday Morning.\" \"I'd just be lying. And I'm not - I can't do that.\"\n\nNewsom has made pushing back against President Donald Trump a top priority, and he's even taken to mimicking Trump's brash social media style.\n\nNewsom wants to be noticed.\n\nWhile the blue-state governor may have the looks and the charm, his record speaks loudly to why he shouldn't get America's top political job.\n\nCalifornia is indeed the poster child for liberal policies that do not work, and Newsom has been their biggest backer. From a $20 minimum wage for fast-food workers to costly government programs that are bankrupting the state, the list is long as to why California-style governing is the last thing this country needs.\n\nI want to focus on just one of the glaring problems.\n\nCalifornia keeps allowing illegal immigrants to get driver's licenses\n\nTwo recent deadly vehicle accidents make a strong case for why California's lax policies on illegal immigration are very wrong for the state - and would be for the country.\n\nCalifornia is already well-known for its \"sanctuary\" status, meaning it actively works against federal immigration laws. The state offers driver's licenses to illegal immigrants, too, among other benefits typically reserved for citizens and other legal residents.\n\nOn Oct. 21, three innocent people were killed - and several others were injured - by 21-year-old Jashanpreet Singh, who was driving a semi-truck on a California highway.\n\nHarrowing dash-cam footage of the accident makes it appear that Singh never even hit the brakes before obliterating the vehicles in front of him.\n\nSingh, who is from India, has been charged with vehicular manslaughter with gross negligence for driving under the influence and causing injury.\n\nHe was also in the country illegally, released at the southern border in 2022 under former President Joe Biden's watch. Shortly following the accident, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement lodged an arrest detainer for Singh.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed in a briefing on Oct. 23 that California issued Singh the commercial driver's license. Newsom has countered that the federal government had previously issued and renewed Singh's employment authorization needed to obtain a commercial license. But it was still California's decision to give him the license.\n\n\"This is a heinous tragedy that took three lives and severely injured others,\" said San Bernardino County District Attorney Jason Anderson in a statement. \"Frankly, it was easily avoidable if the defendant was not driving in a grossly negligent manner and impaired. Had the rule of law been followed by State and Federal officials the defendant should have never been in California at all.\"\n\nIndeed.\n\nTrump is fighting against open borders and failed policies\n\nIt's not the first time California policies that grant illegal immigrants driver's licenses have been linked to a fatal accident.\n\nIn August, another foreign truck driver caused a deadly collision in Florida that killed three people. The driver, also from India, was charged with three counts of vehicular homicide and had entered the country illegally via Mexico in 2018, according to the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles.\n\nThe driver allegedly did not speak English and had been issued a non-domiciled commercial driver's license by California in 2024. He'd previously been issued a CDL by Washington state, even though he'd failed the test 10 times prior to receiving it, according to Fox News.\n\nIn light of the August accident, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy had already taken action to tighten rules for who can get commercial licenses. On Oct. 15, he said the Transportation Department would withhold $40 million from California after an investigation found it was the only state not enforcing English language requirements for truckers.\n\nDuffy was clearly upset by the latest deadly crash in California.\n\n\"This is exactly why I set new restrictions that prohibit ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS from operating trucks,\" he said via social media on Oct 23.\n\nUnder the Trump administration, Biden's open border has effectively been closed and many of these other dangerous policies are being quashed.\n\nThe last thing we need is for Newsom to make the rest of the country look more like California.\n\nIngrid Jacques is a columnist at USA TODAY.

    "body": "REDDING, Calif. -- In a stretch of Northern California known for farming, ranching and a rural way of life, residents worry a ballot measure to redraw U.S. House maps is all but certain to dilute what little political power they possess in the heavily Democratic state.\n\nIf Proposition 50 passes, voters in three northern counties that went strongly for President Donald Trump in the last three elections would share a representative with some of the state's wealthiest and most liberal coastal communities. Rural voters would be outnumbered, making it unlikely for a Republican candidate to prevail.\n\n\"Most of us see it as, you know, just massive gerrymandering, taking what little representation that we had away and now we'll have absolutely nothing,\" Patrick Jones, a former Shasta County supervisor, said in a recent interview in his family's gun shop.\n\nVoting concludes Nov. 4 on the measure, which would create partisan U.S. House maps outside of normal once-a-decade redistricting handled by an independent commission. It's an effort by Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom to counter a Trump-backed plan in Texas to gain five more Republican seats. He says it's necessary to defend democracy, but California Republicans call it a power grab that will disenfranchise voters. Republicans currently hold nine of the state's 52 congressional seats.\n\nIn Redding, one of the largest cities north of Sacramento, bright yellow signs urging residents to defend fair elections and rural representation dot the highway. A local man recently led a one-person protest in front of City Hall, while more than 150 others showed up at a rally to reject what they see as a scheme by Democrats to take away their voices.\n\nBut they face an uphill battle in the state where registered Democrats outnumber Republicans by nearly 2-to-1. Democrats have returned nearly twice as many ballots. Labor unions and other Democratic allies have mobilized hundreds of volunteers to reach voters in solidly blue areas like Los Angeles with millions of voters. Two weeks before Election Day, just about 7,000 ballots had been returned in Shasta County, county clerk Clint Curtis said. He expects lower turnout than normal.\n\nTV advertising opposing the measure -- a key investment in the sprawling state -- has largely dried up. Some residents in Redding say they've heard little from Republican Rep. Doug LaMalfa about a plan to fight the measure, though he's scheduled an event Wednesday in another city in his district.\n\nUnder the new maps, voters in Shasta, Siskiyou and Modoc counties -- all conservative strongholds in the rural north -- would be in the same congressional district with Marin County, which sits just across the Golden Gate Bridge from San Francisco.\n\nLaMalfa's current district includes farms that grow rice, olive and other tree nuts, and ranching is prevalent in the farthest northern reaches. Lassen National Volcanic Park, historic Shasta Dam and snow-capped Mt. Shasta are defining features. Redding has a population under 100,000. Distrust of government and belief in election conspiracies are common. In 2024, 67% of voters in Shasta County supported Trump.\n\nMarin County, meanwhile, went 80% for Democrat Kamala Harris. The median household income tops $140,000 -- roughly double that of Shasta County. It's part of a district that runs north up the Pacific coastline to Oregon and is known for redwood forests, wine production and cannabis farms. It's represented by Democratic Rep. Jared Huffman.\n\nLaMalfa, a rice farmer, opposes the proposition and has spent at least $63,000 from his campaign fund to reach voters through text messages and yard signs. He also gave $50,000 to a statewide \"no\" campaign. Brenda Haynes, who works in LaMalfa's district office, said the congressman has joined residents waving flags on highway overpasses. His campaign declined a request for a reporter to shadow him on the trail.\n\n\"I think he's done phone calls and stuff, but I haven't really heard from him,\" said Toby Ruiz, a retired state worker who's lived in the area for most of his life.\n\nLaMalfa's supporters say they appreciate his conservative stances and push for an important new water storage project.\n\n\"I pretty much love the guy,\" said Bob Braz, a Redding area native who owns a bait shop. \"I stand for almost all the things that he's done.\"\n\nThose who don't know much about LaMalfa's record said they trust him because of his background.\n\n\"I don't hear much about him but he's a farmer,\" said Liz Jacobs, who moved from the Bay Area to Redding 20 years ago. She added: \"I don't know about somebody from the Bay Area with their progressive ideas.\"\n\nNewsom and other Democrats say the measure is a tool to fight Trump's agenda and counter Republican efforts to pickup seats elsewhere. Even if it passes and Democrats win five more seats, it may not help the party retain the House. Republicans in Missouri, North Carolina and Indiana are joining Texas in trying to draw more winnable seats in the 2026 midterms. Lawmakers in Virginia, meanwhile, are back in session to work on a map more friendly to Democrats. All of the efforts are sure to face legal challenges.\n\n\"This is not the fight we want to fight. This was not our battle,\" Newsom said in a recent virtual campaign event. \"This is in reaction to something unprecedented that happened.\"\n\nBut voters in Redding see it as another way to silence their voices.\n\nThey have long felt neglected by the Democratic-controlled Legislature in Sacramento, which they blame for raising the cost of living and infringing on local control. Lawmakers, for example, banned counties from hand-counting ballots in most cases after Shasta County leaders voted to get rid of their vote-counting machines in 2023.\n\nSome said they worry that national Republicans won't put up a fight to hold the seats if the measure passes.\n\n\"You would have to spend a huge amount of money to reach your base,\" said Jones, the former county supervisor. \"And they're just simply not going to want to waste that amount of money because it would be better spent throughout the country elsewhere.\"\n\nNot all voters are dreading a change.\n\nWarren Swanson, a Redding resident of more than 40 years, called LaMalfa \"Do Nothing Doug.\" His wife, Tara Swanson, also voted \"yes\" on the measure, partly because it promises to give map-drawing power back to the independent commission after the 2030 Census.\n\n\"Do two wrongs make a right? It's a tough one for those of us who think along those lines,\" Tara Swanson said.\n\nSome liberal voters in Mt. Shasta in Siskiyou County are hoping to oust LaMalfa over his vote for Trump's sweeping tax and spending bill that will overhaul health care and food assistance programs. Mothers, families and older adults in town could go hungry because of changes to food assistance programs, said Colleen Shelly, a Mt. Shasta resident who works with the state food assistance program.\n\nBut the fight is far from over for Republican voters in California, said Walter Stephen Rubke, a 38-year-old who moved to Redding last year. Many young people are supporting conservatives, he said, and he expects continual resistance from GOP voters even if the measure passes.\n\n\"I see a hard path ahead,\" he said. \"But I feel confident. I feel hopeful.\"",

    "body": "WASHINGTON (AP) -- Led by Gov. Gavin Newsom, California Democrats are charging toward a new congressional map that could flip as many as five U.S. House seats from Republican to Democratic control. But first, they need voters to sign off.\n\nCalifornia voters head to the polls on Tuesday with just one yes-or-no question on the ballot. Passing Proposition 50 would implement a new congressional map, which passed the state legislature in August, for the next three election cycles. After the 2030 U.S. Census, the state's independent redistricting commission would resume drawing maps.\n\nPoliticians around the country are reshaping congressional voting districts -- a task typically done just once a decade, after each census -- in an effort to give their parties' candidates an edge in next year's elections. The national battle over partisan gerrymandering began in Texas, after a push from President Donald Trump. The Republican-controlled state adopted a new map in August that could flip five Democratic-leaning U.S. House seats. California was the second state to make moves. Between the California legislature passing the map and this election, Missouri and North Carolina both adopted new maps. Other states may soon follow.\n\nThe outcome of this ballot measure could help determine control of the U.S. House after the 2026 midterm elections, which will see Republicans try to buck a historical pattern of the president's party losing seats in midterm elections. The GOP's margin is slim: Heading into Tuesday's election, Republicans control 219 seats to Democrats' 213, with three vacancies.\n\nIf Prop 50 is approved, it's possible the Democrats could control as many as 48 of California's 52 congressional seats, up from the 43 seats the party now holds. In some cases, the recast districts would slice across California, with one uniting rural, conservative-leaning northern California with Marin County, a liberal coastal stronghold north of San Francisco. In others, district lines are left unchanged or have only minor adjustments.\n\nPartisans have lined up on both sides of the measure, which has seen well over $200 million in contributions.\n\nIf support for the ballot measure breaks along partisan lines -- which is not a guarantee -- the Democratic-backed \"Yes\" side would be favored to pass. The Democratic Party has a statewide voter registration advantage of more than 4.5 million voters, and Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris won California by around 20 percentage points last fall.\n\nOpponents of the measure, which include major Republican figures from the state ranging from former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy to potentially affected representatives, have reported raising more than $80 million. National Republicans are kicking in: The Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC dedicated to electing Republicans to the U.S. House of Representatives, has kicked in $5 million.\n\nThe \"No\" on 50 campaign also benefited from the high-profile involvement of former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, one of the last Republicans to win statewide office and a longtime opponent of gerrymandering. They're framing the initiative as a scheme by Democrats to boost their own influence and circumvent the voter-approved independent redistricting commission.\n\nBut the \"No\" campaign is shorter on cash than its opponents. The \"Yes\" side has raised around $138 million, according to data from the California secretary of state's office. And data from AdImpact, the nonpartisan advertising tracker, indicates the \"No\" side's ad spending has slowed to a trickle in the lead-up to the election.\n\nNewsom and both national and statewide Democrats have been very involved in advocating for the measure. Newsom contributed $2.6 million of his own campaign funds, while the House Majority PAC, an independent expenditure group backing Democratic House candidates, put in almost $15 million.\n\nThe Associated Press does not make projections and will declare a winner only when it's determined there is no scenario that would allow the trailing candidates to close the gap. If a race has not been called, the AP will continue to cover any newsworthy developments, such as candidate concessions or declarations of victory. In doing so, the AP will make clear that it has not yet declared a winner and explain why.\n\nThere are no automatic recounts in California. Any registered California voter may request a recount, but the voter or campaign committee represented by the voter requesting the recount must pay for it. The AP may declare a winner in a race that is eligible for a recount if it determines the lead is too large for a recount or legal challenge to change the outcome.\n\nHere's a look at what to expect:\n\nElection Day\n\nCalifornia's special election will be held Tuesday, though mail-in voting has been available for weeks. Polls close at 8 p.m. PT, or 11 p.m. ET.\n\nWhat's on the ballot?\n\nThe AP will provide vote results and declare the winner in the redistricting ballot measure.\n\nWho gets to vote?\n\nAny voter registered in California may participate in the special election.\n\nWhat do turnout and advance vote look like?\n\nAs of Sept. 5, there were about 23.1 million registered voters in California. Of those, 45% were Democrats and 25% were Republicans. About 5.2 million voters were not registered with any party.\n\nTurnout in the 2021 gubernatorial recall, an off-year election in which that statewide vote was the only contest on the ballot, was about 58%.\n\nAs of Oct. 28, a total of 4.74 million ballots had been cast before Election Day. See the AP Early Vote Tracker for the latest update.\n\nHow long does vote counting usually take?\n\nIn the 2024 presidential election, the AP first reported results in California at 11:12 p.m. ET, or 12 minutes after polls closed. The vote tabulation ended for the night at 7:00 a.m. ET with about 54% of total votes counted.\n\nAre we there yet?\n\nAs of Tuesday, there will be 364 days until the 2026 midterm elections and 1,099 days until the 2028 general election.\n\n___\n\nFollow the AP's coverage of the 2025 election at https://apnews.com/projects/election-results-2025/.",

    "body": "In a press event launching a lawsuit against the Trump administration over SNAP benefits Tuesday, Gov. Gavin Newsom cited Scripture as evidence the government should feed the hungry. (Credit: Handout)\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom invoked biblical teachings while criticizing Republican leadership and the Trump administration for the federal government shutdown's impact on food assistance, arguing that Scripture commands care for the hungry and that Washington is failing that moral test.\n\nSpeaking Tuesday in Sacramento alongside state Attorney General Rob Bonta and Health and Human Services Secretary Kim Johnson, Newsom cited teachings from Matthew, Isaiah, Luke and Proverbs as evidence that feeding the poor is \"core and central to what it is to align to God's will.\"\n\n\"It's not a suggestion in the Old [and] the New Testament,\" Newsom said. \"These guys need to stop the B.S. in Washington. They're sitting there in their prayer breakfasts. Maybe they got an edited version of [President] Donald Trump's Bible, and they edited all of that out. Cruelty is the policy.\"\n\nNEWSOM REBUKES WHITE HOUSE DEFENSE OF PRAYER AFTER SHOOTING: KIDS WERE 'LITERALLY PRAYING AS THEY GOT SHOT AT'\n\nNewsom, who was raised Catholic and graduated from Santa Clara University, a Jesuit institution, has occasionally cited his faith background and Jesuit education when discussing social issues.\n\nIn his remarks Tuesday, he referenced \"a wonderful Jesuit university\" and said lessons from the New Testament emphasize feeding the hungry and caring for the poor.\n\nNewsom's comments came as California and two dozen other states sued the Trump administration's U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) over its decision to suspend November Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits during the government shutdown.\n\nBonta said the agency has contingency funds and is allegedly \"unlawfully withholding payments.\"\n\nWhile Newsom tied the issue to Scripture, he recently came under fire for pushing against White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt's assertion of the power of prayer in the wake of the Annunciation Catholic Church shooting in August.\n\nUSDA CHIEF WARNS 'WE'RE RIGHT AT THE CLIFF' AS 40 MILLION AMERICANS BRACE FOR FOOD STAMP CUTOFF\n\n\"These children were literally praying as they got shot at,\" Newsom wrote above a clip of Leavitt promoting prayer.\n\nNewsom pressed the point repeatedly in his Tuesday remarks, saying leaders who cite religion should reflect those values in policy.\n\n\"We're going to win this lawsuit,\" he said. \"It's about serving those that are hungry.\"\n\nCalifornia officials said the state has accelerated $80 million to food banks and deployed volunteers and National Guard members to move supplies. Johnson said CalFresh serves 5.5 million residents monthly and warned that a lapse in SNAP benefits would increase poverty.\n\nNewsom closed his remarks by again linking government action to biblical duty. \"It's around food. It's about serving those that are hungry,\" he said.\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson pushed back sharply, accusing the governor of hypocrisy.\n\n\"It's preposterous that Newsom, who shuttered churches during COVID and recently derided the power of prayer, is now attempting to manipulate religion to fit his own political agenda,\" Jackson said in a statement to Fox News Digital.\n\n\"President Trump wants the government open -- the Democrats' insistence on keeping it shut down is hurting the American people, but they could prevent these harms by simply reopening the government. Instead of distorting religion for political means, Newsom should urge his fellow Democrats to reopen the government.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nOn Fox News' \"America Reports\" Tuesday, USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins blamed Democrats for refusing to vote on measures to reopen the government and restore SNAP funding.\n\n\"We are right at the cliff. And I've been warning about this for almost a month now, that we have enough money to get us through the end of October. But after that, the government has to reopen,\" Rollins said.\n\nThe USDA and Newsom's office did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's requests for comment.",

    "body": "Just one week out from California's Nov. 4 special election, Gov. Gavin Newsom is putting the brakes on some fundraising for Proposition 50, the Democrat-backed congressional redistricting measure.\n\nNewsom's unusual request to small donors of his Yes on 50 campaign comes after the governor said he's reached his fundraising goal for the measure. Newsom made the announcement during a press conference on Tuesday.\n\n\"It's the first time, I don't know, likely to be the last time I've ever said, 'stop, please don't send any more money,' \" Newsom said. \"I don't know many elected officials who've ever been able to lay claim to that.\"\n\nNewsom's Yes on 50 Ballot Measure Committee has already recieved contributions of $119 million as of October 28, according to the California Secretary of State website, which was updated on Tuesday.\n\nThat compares to a group of No on 50 campaign committees -- the Congressional Leadership Fund, Protect Voters First, Stop Sacramento's Power Grab, Voters Deserve Better -- that have amassed a combined $89 million in contributions as of the same date.\n\nThe Yes on 50 campaign has turned its money into ads framing the election as a President Trump versus California debate, while the No on 50 side has focused on the ideas of protecting the principle of independent redistricting.\n\nSteve Maviglio is a democratic strategist and frequent Newsom critic who says the yes campaign messaging is making a difference.\n\n\"Well, the yes side is all over the airwaves and social media,\" Maviglio said. \"And if you look at the early returns, more ballots are coming from Democrats than there are from Republicans, even by registration. So the yes side has done a very good job appealing to Democrats and making this a very partisan issue, which of course they can't lose in a state with so many Democrats.\"\n\nA recent CBS News poll shows 62% of likely voters will vote yes on Proposition 50.\n\nAccording to Political Data, Inc., so far, 21% of registered voters have cast their ballots in early voting, and twice the number of registered Democrats as Republicans have returned their ballots.",

    "title": "Newsom Hires US Attorney Fired by Trump",
    "body": "After President Trump fired the acting U.S. attorney in Sacramento, his California nemesis, Gov. Gavin Newsom, took notice.\n\nFirst, Mr. Newsom stuck up for the ousted prosecutor, Michele Beckwith, on X. \"WAKE UP, AMERICA,\" the governor's press office posted. \"DEMOCRACY IS ON THE BRINK!\" The post was accompanied by photos of Ms. Beckwith and Mr. Trump, his face half-hidden in shadows.\n\nNow, Mr. Newsom has hired Ms. Beckwith as a deputy legal affairs secretary. In government-speak, that means she is an attorney providing legal counsel to the governor and state agencies.\n\n\"Michele brings to our office more than 20 years of legal experience and invaluable knowledge of the law,\" said Tara Gallegos, a spokeswoman for Mr. Newsom. \"Trump's loss is California's gain.\"\n\nThe White House referred a request for comment on Ms. Beckwith's new role to the Department of Justice, which declined to comment on the matter.\n\nThe New York Times first reported last month that Ms. Beckwith had been quietly fired less than six hours after emailing Gregory Bovino, the Border Patrol chief based in Southern California, that he would have to abide by court orders and the Constitution while conducting a planned operation in her district.\n\nShe sent the email to Mr. Bovino on July 15 after he had notified her that he was headed to Sacramento for an immigration operation. She said she wanted to ensure he knew about court orders in her district requiring that Border Patrol agents could only detain people if they had a reasonable suspicion that those people were violating federal immigration law.\n\nThat afternoon, Ms. Beckwith received an email from the White House stating that her employment with the Department of Justice was terminated \"on behalf of President Donald J. Trump.\" Her phone and computer went dark, and she was marched out of the office.\n\nTwo days later, Mr. Bovino and his agents raided a Home Depot parking lot in Sacramento. He posted a video on X in which he said: \"Folks, there is no such thing as a sanctuary city. There is no such thing as a sanctuary state.\"\n\nMr. Bovino said in an emailed statement last month to The New York Times, \"The former Acting US Attorney's email suggesting that the United States Border Patrol does not ALWAYS abide by the Constitution revealed a bias against law enforcement.\"\n\nMr. Bovino's tactics have come under scrutiny in Chicago, where a federal judge admonished him on Tuesday after the agency apparently violated her orders restricting the use of force and tear gas.\n\nMs. Beckwith's firing was an early example of the president's ousting of top federal prosecutors who did not carry out his agenda. After firing her, he fired a U.S. attorney in Virginia who had determined there was not enough evidence to indict James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director, and Letitia James, the New York State attorney general, both of whom are political targets of the president. The replacement U.S. attorney later indicted both of them.\n\nThere are 93 U.S. attorneys who oversee federal prosecutions in districts around the country. Ms. Beckwith, a career prosecutor, had been working as the No. 2 attorney in the office when her boss, who had been appointed by the Biden administration, resigned shortly before Mr. Trump was inaugurated. She then kept doing her old job while filling in as acting U.S. attorney.\n\nMr. Trump not only removed her as acting U.S. attorney but also ended her career as a federal prosecutor, a move experts said was unusual.\n\nMs. Beckwith, who started her new job last week, said in an interview that she was still getting acclimated and was looking forward to \"a very interesting year.\"\n\n\"To me, it's not political -- it's existential for our country,\" she said. \"So if there's something I can do to assist in keeping our democracy and Constitution alive, that is what I am happy to do.\"",

    "title": "In a California GOP stronghold, voters are not happy with Newsom's plan to help Democrats",
    "body": "REDDING, Calif. -- In a stretch of Northern California known for farming, ranching and a rural way of life, residents worry a ballot measure to redraw U.S. House maps is all but certain to dilute what little political power they possess in the heavily Democratic state.\n\nIf Proposition 50 passes, voters in three northern counties that went strongly for President Donald Trump in the last three elections would share a representative with some of the state's wealthiest and most liberal coastal communities. Rural voters would be outnumbered, making it unlikely for a Republican candidate to prevail.\n\n\"Most of us see it as, you know, just massive gerrymandering, taking what little representation that we had away and now we'll have absolutely nothing,\" Patrick Jones, a former Shasta County supervisor, said in a recent interview in his family's gun shop.\n\nVoting concludes Nov. 4 on the measure, which would create partisan U.S. House maps outside of normal once-a-decade redistricting handled by an independent commission. It's an effort by Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom to counter a Trump-backed plan in Texas to gain five more Republican seats. He says it's necessary to defend democracy, but California Republicans call it a power grab that will disenfranchise voters. Republicans currently hold nine of the state's 52 congressional seats.\n\nIn Redding, one of the largest cities north of Sacramento, bright yellow signs urging residents to defend fair elections and rural representation dot the highway. A local man recently led a one-person protest in front of City Hall, while more than 150 others showed up at a rally to reject what they see as a scheme by Democrats to take away their voices.\n\nBut they face an uphill battle in the state where registered Democrats outnumber Republicans by nearly 2-to-1. Democrats have returned nearly twice as many ballots. Labor unions and other Democratic allies have mobilized hundreds of volunteers to reach voters in solidly blue areas like Los Angeles with millions of voters. Two weeks before Election Day, just about 7,000 ballots had been returned in Shasta County, county clerk Clint Curtis said. He expects lower turnout than normal.\n\nTV advertising opposing the measure -- a key investment in the sprawling state -- has largely dried up. Some residents in Redding say they've heard little from Republican Rep. Doug LaMalfa about a plan to fight the measure, though he's scheduled an event Wednesday in another city in his district.\n\nUnder the new maps, voters in Shasta, Siskiyou and Modoc counties -- all conservative strongholds in the rural north -- would be in the same congressional district with Marin County, which sits just across the Golden Gate Bridge from San Francisco.\n\nLaMalfa's current district includes farms that grow rice, olive and other tree nuts, and ranching is prevalent in the farthest northern reaches. Lassen National Volcanic Park, historic Shasta Dam and snow-capped Mt. Shasta are defining features. Redding has a population under 100,000. Distrust of government and belief in election conspiracies are common. In 2024, 67% of voters in Shasta County supported Trump.\n\nMarin County, meanwhile, went 80% for Democrat Kamala Harris. The median household income tops $140,000 -- roughly double that of Shasta County. It's part of a district that runs north up the Pacific coastline to Oregon and is known for redwood forests, wine production and cannabis farms. It's represented by Democratic Rep. Jared Huffman.\n\nLaMalfa, a rice farmer, opposes the proposition and has spent at least $63,000 from his campaign fund to reach voters through text messages and yard signs. He also gave $50,000 to a statewide \"no\" campaign. Brenda Haynes, who works in LaMalfa's district office, said the congressman has joined residents waving flags on highway overpasses. His campaign declined a request for a reporter to shadow him on the trail.\n\n\"I think he's done phone calls and stuff, but I haven't really heard from him,\" said Toby Ruiz, a retired state worker who's lived in the area for most of his life.\n\nLaMalfa's supporters say they appreciate his conservative stances and push for an important new water storage project.\n\n\"I pretty much love the guy,\" said Bob Braz, a Redding area native who owns a bait shop. \"I stand for almost all the things that he's done.\"\n\nThose who don't know much about LaMalfa's record said they trust him because of his background.\n\n\"I don't hear much about him but he's a farmer,\" said Liz Jacobs, who moved from the Bay Area to Redding 20 years ago. She added: \"I don't know about somebody from the Bay Area with their progressive ideas.\"\n\nNewsom and other Democrats say the measure is a tool to fight Trump's agenda and counter Republican efforts to pickup seats elsewhere. Even if it passes and Democrats win five more seats, it may not help the party retain the House. Republicans in Missouri, North Carolina and Indiana are joining Texas in trying to draw more winnable seats in the 2026 midterms. Lawmakers in Virginia, meanwhile, are back in session to work on a map more friendly to Democrats. All of the efforts are sure to face legal challenges.\n\n\"This is not the fight we want to fight. This was not our battle,\" Newsom said in a recent virtual campaign event. \"This is in reaction to something unprecedented that happened.\"\n\nBut voters in Redding see it as another way to silence their voices.\n\nThey have long felt neglected by the Democratic-controlled Legislature in Sacramento, which they blame for raising the cost of living and infringing on local control. Lawmakers, for example, banned counties from hand-counting ballots in most cases after Shasta County leaders voted to get rid of their vote-counting machines in 2023.\n\nSome said they worry that national Republicans won't put up a fight to hold the seats if the measure passes.\n\n\"You would have to spend a huge amount of money to reach your base,\" said Jones, the former county supervisor. \"And they're just simply not going to want to waste that amount of money because it would be better spent throughout the country elsewhere.\"\n\nNot all voters are dreading a change.\n\nWarren Swanson, a Redding resident of more than 40 years, called LaMalfa \"Do Nothing Doug.\" His wife, Tara Swanson, also voted \"yes\" on the measure, partly because it promises to give map-drawing power back to the independent commission after the 2030 Census.\n\n\"Do two wrongs make a right? It's a tough one for those of us who think along those lines,\" Tara Swanson said.\n\nSome liberal voters in Mt. Shasta in Siskiyou County are hoping to oust LaMalfa over his vote for Trump's sweeping tax and spending bill that will overhaul health care and food assistance programs. Mothers, families and older adults in town could go hungry because of changes to food assistance programs, said Colleen Shelly, a Mt. Shasta resident who works with the state food assistance program.\n\nBut the fight is far from over for Republican voters in California, said Walter Stephen Rubke, a 38-year-old who moved to Redding last year. Many young people are supporting conservatives, he said, and he expects continual resistance from GOP voters even if the measure passes.\n\n\"I see a hard path ahead,\" he said. \"But I feel confident. I feel hopeful.\"",

    "body": "Florida Governor Ron DeSantis weighs in on the petition in support of the illegal alien trucker accused of killing three and California Governor Gavin Newsom's 'tough guy' act on 'Hannity.'\n\nFlorida on Tuesday carried out its 15th execution of the year -- a record under Gov. Ron DeSantis -- putting to death Norman Mearle Grim Jr., who was convicted of raping and murdering his neighbor more than two decades ago.\n\nA spokesperson for Desantis confirmed 65-year-old Grim was pronounced dead at 6:14 p.m. after receiving a three-drug injection at the Florida State Prison near Starke, according to The Associated Press.\n\nThe spokesperson, Alex Lanfranconi, noted that Grim was asked if he had a final statement before receiving the injection, and he replied, \"No sir.\"\n\nLanfranconi also said there were no complications during the execution.\n\nFLORIDA CONTINUES TO EXTEND RECORD EXECUTION YEAR WITH MAN PUT TO DEATH FOR KILLING WIFE'S FAMILY\n\nGrim was sentenced to death after being convicted of sexual battery and first-degree murder in the death of Cynthia Campbell. The victim was reported missing in July 1998 and her body, which was battered, was found by a fisherman in the water near the Pensacola Bay Bridge.\n\nProsecutors made the case that Campbell suffered multiple blunt-force injuries to her face and head, consistent with those of being struck by a hammer. She also had 11 stab wounds in the chest.\n\nWhen an autopsy was conducted on Campbell, it was discovered that seven of the 11 stab wounds penetrated her heart. Physical evidence, including DNA, tied Grim to Campbell's murder.\n\nFLORIDA BREAKS 50-YEAR EXECUTION RECORD WITH NINTH DEATH SENTENCE CARRIED OUT THIS YEAR\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in 1976, and since then, the highest previous annual total of executions in Florida was set at eight in 2014.\n\nThis year, though, Florida has executed more people than any other state, followed by Texas and Alabama with five each.\n\nGrim waived any appeal to his conviction earlier this month, despite being given a last chance to make an appeal to the Florida Supreme Court and U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nFLORIDA EXTENDS RECORD EXECUTIONS WITH DATE SET FOR MAN WHO FATALLY STABBED COUPLE DURING ROBBERY\n\nWhen he woke up at 6 a.m. on Tuesday, Grim had fried pork chops and mashed potatoes with a chocolate milkshake, the Department of Corrections told The AP. The spokesperson said Grim did not have any visitors, nor did he meet with a spiritual advisor before the execution.\n\nTwo more executions are planned next month in Florida.\n\nBryan Fredrick Jennings, 66, is scheduled for the state's 16th execution on Nov. 13. He was convicted of raping and killing a 6-year-old girl in 1979 after entering through a window and abducting her from her central Florida home.\n\nRichard Barry Randolph, 63, is set for Florida's 17th execution on Nov. 20. He was convicted of the 1988 rape and fatal beating of his former manager at a Florida convenience store.\n\nCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nFlorida's lethal injections are carried out with a sedative, a paralytic and a drug that stops the heart, according to the state Department of Corrections.",

    "title": "Gov. Gavin Newsom tells Prop. 50 backers to stop donating: 'We've raised enough'",
    "body": "During any campaign season, voters and nonvoters alike are inundated with ads and text messages and emails begging for money for a political cause or candidate.\n\nThat's been true for California's special election on redistricting, only called a couple of months ago.\n\nBut in a fairly unusual turn of events, Gov. Gavin Newsom, who has spearheaded the campaign in favor of mid-cycle redistricting, had a different message for donors on Tuesday, a week before Election Day: Keep your money.\n\n\"We've raised enough money to win this campaign,\" Newsom said in a video posted on social media on Oct. 28.\n\n\"That doesn't mean we've won the campaign, quite the contrary, but we reached our goals, we've reached our budget,\" Newsom said.\n\n\"So please, don't send any more money to the Yes on 50 campaign,\" he said, encouraging supporters to instead focus on getting people to vote who have not yet cast their ballot.\n\nCalifornia voters have been asked whether to implement new, partisan congressional maps for the 2026, 2028 and 2030 elections. That would mean forgoing the current maps drawn by a 14-member group comprising five Republicans, five Democrats and four commissioners not affiliated with the two major parties.\n\nThe idea is a partisan one, an effort to favor Democrats in California's congressional elections as a way to counter similar, Republican-led plans elsewhere in the country to boost the GOP at the behest of President Donald Trump.\n\nRecent polling has shown Proposition 50, the redistricting measure, on track to pass.\n\nA recent Emerson College poll found 57% of likely California voters surveyed said they support Prop. 50, while 37% opposed it. Spencer Kimball, executive director of Emerson College Polling, noted some demographic groups that were hesitant to support Prop. 50 a month prior had increased their support for it when asked for the survey conducted Oct. 20-21.\n\nMeanwhile, another recent survey of likely voters by CBS News/YouGov, found 62% supported the measure and 38% opposed it. (This survey was conducted from Oct. 16-21.)\n\nVoting in the special election is already underway, with ballots mailed to all registered California voters earlier in October. Those can be returned through the mail, at drop boxes or early voting sites and vote centers, many of which opened over the weekend.\n\nStill, the strategy of telling potential donors to keep their wallets closed is \"entirely unprecedented,\" said Matt Lesenyie, an expert in political psychology who teaches at Cal State Long Beach.\n\n\"It seems like something your opponent would do,\" Lesenyie said, \"to get people to stop supporting that campaign.\"\n\nCampaigns generally raise money right up until the election -- and even after -- because of how much money they've spent and debt they've incurred, said Lesenyie.\n\nBut with this type of election -- there's only one thing on the ballot for voters to decide -- people who are going to participate most likely already cast their ballot or have a plan to do so. Extra money for extra advertising probably won't convince anyone now in these final days of the campaign, said Lesenyie, especially when many people are tired of how much money is in politics these days.\n\nBut Lesenyie said it's also \"excellent branding\" for Newsom, who over the weekend finally openly admitted he's considering a run for president.\n\n\"It suggests a management and foresight about not just this political fight but coming fights,\" said Lesenyie.\n\nEven Jessica Millan Patterson, the former California GOP chairperson who is leading the No on 50 campaign, said having more than enough money is \"a great problem to have.\"\n\n\"It's not one I've ever had. We're very familiar with being outspent,\" said Patterson, adding the anti-Prop. 50 side had acknowledged the campaign would be an uphill battle from the onset. \"I'd love to be in the situation where I could tell people we have everything we ever need.\"\n\nThe Yes on 50 campaign has raised more than $114 million this year, according to filings with the secretary of state's office. It also has some $37 million on hand left to spend.\n\nNewsom, in his Tuesday video, said $38 million in small donations came from some 1.2 million contributions.\n\nMeanwhile, the anti-Prop. 50 Stop Sacramento's Power Grab campaign raised nearly $11 million this year and has about $2 million left to spend. Another effort opposing the redistricting measure, called Protect Voters First, raised nearly $33 million and has about $336,000 still on hand.",

    "title": "Drake, Adin Ross And Stake Online Casino Sued For 'Deceptive' Online Gambling Practices",
    "body": "Forbes has reached out to Stake, representatives for Drake and Ross for comment.\n\nThe \"dual-currency\" format that some online casinos in the United States use, like Stake's bundling of gold coins with Stake Cash, has come under increasing scrutiny in recent weeks. Earlier this month, California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill outlawing online sweepstakes casinos that use this dual-currency model and making online games that simulate gambling and may make players eligible for prizes, cash or cash equivalents unlawful. In August, Los Angeles City Attorney Hydee Feldstein Soto filed a lawsuit against Stake.us, making similar allegations to Killham's Missouri suit. Feldstein Soto accused Stake of creating Stake.us as a \"carbon copy of Stake.com\" with \"virtually the same layout, games, graphics, colors and user interfaces,\" while rebranding it as a social casino, to bypass state gambling laws. Feldstein Soto's lawsuit says the online platform \"provides players with the opportunity to exchange their real money for virtual casino chips, gamble those chips, and then convert the winnings back into cash,\" adding the platform \"looks like gambling, sounds like gambling, and feels like gambling because it is gambling.\" Feldstein Soto's lawsuit named Stake's billionaire founders, Craven and Tehrani, as co-defendants.\n\nStake garnered attention earlier this year for an apparent advertising push that involved X accounts posting memes and other content with a small Stake logo at the bottom, though it's unclear whether Stake was behind these posts or paid creators to add the Stake logo to their content. In response to one of a viral post of an adult film actress that included the Stake logo, the United Kingdom's Gambling Commission launched an investigation into the platform. In February, the commission said gambling company TGP Europe Limited, which partnered with Stake for its United Kingdom operations, would shut down the Stake platform in the country.\n\nEd Craven and Bijan Tehrani are both worth $2.8 billion, according to Forbes estimates. Stake.com generated $4.7 billion in revenue in 2024, Forbes previously reported. Craven and Tehrani are also founders of Kick, a livestreaming platform they launched as a rival to Twitch.",

    "body": "California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom said he is \"deeply concerned\" about remarks from President Donald Trump and his close allies about possibly seeking a third term in 2028.\n\nNewsom, who is considered a potential 2028 presidential contender himself, was asked by ABC News Chief Washington Correspondent Jonathan Karl if he takes such talk seriously.\n\n\"They're not screwing around,\" Newsom said.\n\nWatch ABC News Chief Washington Correspondent Jonathan Karl's interview with California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Wednesday at 8:30 p.m. ET on ABC News Live and streaming on Disney+ and Hulu.\n\nTrump has mused several times about running for president again, including as recently as Monday, when he told reporters on Air Force One that he would \"love to do it\" despite it being barred by the Constitution.\n\nThe 22nd Amendment expressly forbids a president from being elected to office more than twice.\n\nLast week, Steve Bannon, the former Trump White House adviser and conservative media provocateur, said in an interview with The Economist that \"there's a plan\" and Trump \"is going to get a third term\" though he didn't share any details.\n\nHere's a transcript of the exchange between Newsom and Karl in the interview that will air on Wednesday in which Newsom talks about his meeting with Trump in the Oval Office in February.\n\nKARL: \"Bannon is talking Trump running again 2028 and you said Trump was talking about his fourth term?\"\n\nNEWSOM: \"He was showing me a photo of -- I turned around, he was at the Resolute [Desk], and he goes, 'Look over there.' I'm like, and I literally looked and I looked him. I'm like, 'OK.' I said, 'Third term?' He goes, 'No, fourth.' And it was FDR's painting up on the wall. I'm like, here we go. I said, 'We're perfect little sheep, aren't we?' He's laughing because we are. He knows exactly what we're going to do. There's a French, I don't know what the, I can't say it in French -- poem that loosely says, 'He pisses on the grasshoppers to hear them sing.' And that's Donald Trump.\"\n\nKARL: \"So do you take that seriously? Do you think he is going to try to stay in office?\"\n\nNEWSOM: \"What I've noticed, what we all have experienced, I hope we're absorbing in our souls, because we're talking about the soul of America, is, I don't think he takes himself seriously, but he iterates. He throws things out. And he plays with it, and he sees how people react, and it manifests. Meaning, once a mind is stretched, it never goes back to its original form. And that's my concern. The more we're talking about this -- and we need to be. Look at what he's doing with masked agents. Look what he's doing federalizing the Guard. Look what he's doing to intimidate and voter suppression. Look what he's going to do with the DOJ. Look what he's trying to do to rig the elections: North Carolina, Missouri, down there, next Florida, not just in Texas. Look what he's doing in terms of the $230 million that is, apparently, his from his DOJ. All the pardoning, all the this -- this great grift, the biggest, most corrupt administration in history. Not just the $400 million plane, but the billion dollars of your tax money as we're cutting food stamps to pay for the damn plane so he can take that toy home with his foundation when he's 93 or whatever he's done with his fourth or fifth term. I'm deeply concerned about it. And guys like Bannon, they're not screwing around. They're not screwing around.\"",

    "body": "Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) bashed President Donald Trump for focusing on his White House ballroom while millions of Americans are on the brink of losing food assistance.\n\nStamping the project with a scathing nickname on Monday, the governor wrote on social media, \"While Donald Trump builds his knock-off Versailles on White House grounds, his government shutdown is depriving millions of Californians of federal food assistance.\"\n\n\"Trump and his lapdog Congress just don't care, period,\" he added.\n\nNewsom was of course referring to the lavish 2,000-acre estate where French kings lived during the 17th and 18th centuries. It became an emblem of royal excess before the monarchy was deposed in the wake of the 1789 revolution.\n\nMockups of Trump's new ballroom feature heavy gilding and details that seem strikingly similar to the French palace. It is expected to span over 90,000-square-feet and cost an estimated $300 million.\n\nConstruction on the project is ramping up at the same time billions of dollars in Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) funding are in threat of running out if the government shutdown continues into November.\n\nCalifornia is one of 23 Democrat-led states suing the Trump administration for refusing to release emergency funds, which have already been approved and allocated by Congress, for food benefits.\n\nIn a press release about the lawsuit, Newsom wrote, \"While Donald Trump parades around the world trying to repair the economic damage he's done with his incompetence, he's denying food to millions of Americans who will go hungry next month. It's cruel and speaks to his basic lack of humanity. He doesn't care about the people of this country, only himself.\"",

    "title": "Friends or enemies? Newsom and Harris could face off for president in 2028",
    "body": "Well, sports fans, how about this scenario -- long-time frenemies Gavin Newsom and Kamala Harris facing off for the Democratic Party's presidential nomination three years hence?\n\nThe two Californians' parallel careers launched in San Francisco nearly three decades ago with the city's storied political kingpin, Willie Brown, mentoring both. Since then, they have carefully avoided direct conflicts while maintaining at least a veneer of mutual support.\n\nHowever, on Sunday both strongly hinted at presidential campaigns in 2028 -- Harris for the third time after falling short in 2020 and losing to Donald Trump in 2024, and Newsom for the first time after repeatedly disavowing interest in the White House during seven years as governor.\n\nNewsom escalated his status as a potential candidate in a pre-recorded interview with CBS News that aired Sunday, while Harris dropped her hint in a pre-recorded interview with BBC in London, which also broadcast Sunday.\n\nAsked whether he would give \"serious thought\" to running for president after next year's midterm elections, Newsom responded, \"Yeah, I'd be lying otherwise. I'd just be lying. And I'm not ... I can't do that.\"\n\nWhen asked if he is moving closer to finding a reason to run he answered, \"Fate will determine that.\"\n\nHis coy response notwithstanding, Newsom has been developing a national image with a possible presidential run in mind, soliciting national media attention and making appearances in other states.\n\nWith Trump back in the White House, Newsom has appointed himself resistor-in-chief and has taken to mocking Trump in social media posts. Polls indicate he has gained traction as a potential candidate.\n\nHarris, meanwhile, has been touring to tout her memoir about her brief campaign against Trump last year after Biden, who had chosen her as his vice presidential running mate in 2020, declared he would not seek re-election. After months of uncertainty Harris announced she would not run for governor in 2026, fueling media speculation she would try for the presidency again in 2028. Her interview with the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg keeps that possibility bubbling.\n\n\"I am not done,\" Harris told the interviewer. \"I have lived my entire career as a life of service and it's in my bones.\"\n\nAsked about polls indicating only lukewarm support for another White House run, Harris responded, \"If I listened to polls I would have not run for my first office, or my second office -- and I certainly wouldn't be sitting here.\"\n\nKuenssberg wrote that Harris has been reticent about plans to run for president, but \"her candor in our conversation was more striking. She was quick, eager even, to put herself in the frame for another tilt at power. But she stopped short of making any concrete commitment.\"\n\nIf Harris is \"not done\" with politics and the governorship is off the table, what else could be on her political horizon other than another presidential bid?",

    "title": "Report: Gavin Newsom's Prostitution Shield Law Creates Sex Market Full of 12, 13-Year-Old Girls in Downtown L.A.",
    "body": "The New York Times has shone a spotlight on the Democrats' long-ignored \"kiddie stroll\" sex market on Los Angeles' Figueroa Street, yet the newspaper downplayed the pimp shield law pushed by a libertarian Democratic legislator, Rep Scott Wiener, and signed by California Gov. Gavin Newsom.\n\n\"For the 77th Street Division, which covers the northern half of the Figueroa Corridor, prostitution had always been a problem. But in recent years, the officers had seen the magnitude of child sex trafficking explode,\" says the article, written by reporter Emily Baumgaertner Nunn.\n\nGangs that had long sold drugs began to take advantage of Figueroa's lucrative opportunity. With a dozen girls, one trafficker could easily make $12,000 a night. \"Drugs are sold once and gone forever, but girls can be resold indefinitely,\" said [police sergeant Alvaro] Navarro, who had been in the division for two decades. Motel owners who noticed the parades of customers but feared the gangs' retribution kept quiet.\n\nBut the Democratic-run state has cut funding for cops and handcuffed their efforts to pull young girls -- some aged 12 -- from the sex-trafficking street, the newspaper noted:\n\nAs trafficking grew, the means to deal with it shrank. In 2021, the Police Department's central human-trafficking unit was disbanded following budget cuts, leaving each division fewer resources to tackle the problem. According to Navarro, the 77th Street Division was supposed to have six investigators at Armendariz's rank in its vice unit. Instead, she was the only one.\n\nTheir jobs grew even more challenging when California repealed the law allowing the police to arrest women who loitered with the intent to engage in prostitution. The repeal, known as SB 357, was intended to prevent profiling of Black, brown, and trans women based on how they dressed. But when it was implemented in January 2023, the effect was that uniformed officers could no longer apprehend groups of girls in lingerie on Figueroa, hoping to recover minors among them. Now officers needed to be willing to swear they had reason to suspect each girl was underage -- but with fake eyelashes and wigs, it was nearly impossible to tell. One girl told vice officers that her trafficker had explained things succinctly: \"We run Figueroa now,\" he said.\n\n\"By the end of 2023, the city attorney had taken to calling Figueroa the Kiddie Stroll because so many of the girls weren't even 13,\" the newspaper wrote.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom signed the police handcuff bill after it was pushed by Wiener and his far-left allies, who passed SB357 in 2022.\n\nThe newspaper did not mention Newsom or Wiener, or clearly describe the pro-prostitution bill, which was pitched by Wiener as legal support for minorities along with gays and \"transgender\" people.\n\nThe ACLU backed the pro-prostitution bill in clear language:\n\nCalifornia's law that criminalizes loitering with intent to commit prostitution gives law enforcement a tool to harass and discriminate against Black and trans communities, particularly women of color. The Safer Streets for All Act will take away this outdated and subjective Penal Code section 653.22 which has for too long allowed law enforcement to criminalize and harass someone based on the color of their skin, their gender, or how they choose to make a living.\n\n...\n\nThese stops are deeply traumatic and have a lasting impact on those who are harassed or arrested. The impact of these encounters with law enforcement reinforces already heightened stigma when someone is arrested for this offense due to the difficulties securing employment and safe housing with an arrest record relating to sex work.\n\nAs some of the most marginalized members of our community, sex workers deserve to maintain their livelihood without fear of violence or arrest. SB 357 will move California one step closer to acknowledging sex workers as deserving of full dignity and respect. [Emphasis original.]\n\nBut the New York Times did get Wiener's name out in Nunn's video about her article:\n\nThe article also did not discuss the impact of President Joe Biden's pro-migration polices. His policies led to a dramatic rise in international sex trafficking in many states.\n\nThe New York Times article produced a strong reaction among readers:\n\nNewsom might help himself if he called in the state's National Guard out to stop the child-trafficking, noted PR expert Frank Luntz:",

Gavin Newsom said Monday night that he no longer has any interest in appearing on Joe Rogan's podcast.\n\nOn the debut episode of CNN's \"The Story Is With Elex Michaelson,\" Newsom shared that he has moved on from any hopes he may have had about ever appearing on \"The Joe Rogan Experience.\" \"For years and years, he's been attacking me and it's one way and he won't have me on,\" he explained. \"He's consistently not having me on. By the way, I'm moving on. I have no interest.\"\n\n\"Joe Rogan's the Facebook of podcasting,\" Newsom added, prompting Michaelson to remark that Rogan still has a \"pretty big audience.\" \"With all due respect, if he has a big audience but he doesn't have big enough confidence -- I didn't go there -- to have me on...\" Newsom said, to which Michaelson further noted that the politician has called Rogan a chicken on social media in the past.\n\nIn early October, Rogan criticized Newsom on one of his episodes, calling his fellow podcaster a \"good bulls -- t artist\" and mocking his rumored presidential aspirations. \"You can't ruin a city and then go on to ruin a state and say, 'Guys, that was just practice. Once I get in as president, I'm gonna fix it all,'\" Rogan said of Newsom's work as both the former Mayor of San Francisco and current Governor of California.\n\nNewsom previously responded to a clip of Rogan's criticism, writing at the time that the podcaster was \"too [chicken emoji] to have me on his show and expose his listeners to the truth.\" Newsom went on to list a number of positive, current statistics about California, concluding: \"I could continue... invite me on any time.\"\n\nNow, it seems Newsom has rescinded that latter comment. \"Here's the thing. These guys, they all have something in common. It's one way,\" Newsom said of Rogan. \"They attack, they belittle, they demean, they take things out of context. But this is a serious thing, and so often we just sit back and go, 'Oh, God, I really would love to go on. Oh, if Kamala Harris just went on Joe Rogan, she would have won.' It's so much deeper than that.\"\n\nElsewhere in the interview, Newsom again teased the idea of running for president in 2028 -- considering that year's election may not be fair if Trump ends up, somehow, running for a third term despite the 22nd Amendment.",

Gavin Newsom (D) said that New York City mayoral candidate Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani (D) isn't bad for the Democratic Party and responded to a question on if democratic socialism belongs in the Democratic Party by saying the party needs to be a bigger tent and \"you can disagree on certain issues. But when we fundamentally believe in the values of growth and inclusion and we believe in social justice, racial justice, economic justice, the things that bind us together, I think we're all better off if we can sort of reconcile those differences.\"\n\nNewsom said, \"I don't think he's bad for the party. I think the way he's campaigned has been extraordinary. I think the way he's energized and communicated, success leaves clues, is something we can look at. As it relates to policy positions, good people can disagree. But I'll tell you, those that are going to have the punditry, the lazy punditry, that, somehow, he's the future of the Democratic Party versus these two extraordinary governors in New Jersey and Virginia, you're going to have to square the fact they ran very different campaigns with different policy platforms, everyone running to represent their regions, their districts. But, bottom line is, the way he's campaigned, I think, has really energized the base of this party. And I think there's a lot that could be learned from that.\"\n\nHost Elex Michaelson then asked, \"Do you think democratic socialism has a home in the Democratic Party?\"\n\nNewsom responded, \"I think we have to have a bigger tent. I think the biggest problem with the Democratic Party is a party -- when I grew up, we had a big tent party. We could disagree on certain issues without being disagreeable. We need to. We need to start building those coalitions back. And so, you can disagree on certain issues. But when we fundamentally believe in the values of growth and inclusion and we believe in social justice, racial justice, economic justice, the things that bind us together, I think we're all better off if we can sort of reconcile those differences.\"",

    "body": "Leo Zacky, who used to help lead his family-owned poultry business Zacky Farms, sat down with Fox News Digital to discuss his view on how California regulations played a part in his family business going under.\n\nLeo Zacky and his family ran one of California's most successful poultry businesses for nearly 100 years until, according to Zacky, a deliberate plan by Newsom and California Democrats ran his family's company into the ground.\n\nCalifornia isn't just hurting small businesses because of waste or incompetence, Zacky said while explaining his personal experience running his family-owned business in California that was eventually forced to shutter in 2018 and sell to a bigger conglomerate. Instead, Zacky, who is running for governor in California, pointed to a system that has favored liberal policy priorities at the expense of businesses like his family's, including strict environmental regulations, labor policies, high energy costs, water regulations, permitting bureaucracy, and more.\n\n\"The consistent problem that we're having in politics is these people that get into office and their net worth might not be that exorbitant, but, my gosh, in such a short amount of time on this supposed government salary, how wealthy they become and the people around them,\" Zacky lamented to FOX Business.\n\n\"Look at how PG&E made a $350,000 donation to Newsom's wife's charity,\" Zacky continued, referring to donations over several years from the major utility company that frequently has business before the state.\n\nGAVIN NEWSOM MOCKED FOR CLAIMING HIS FAMILY WAS 'HUSTLING' TO PAY THE BILLS\n\nZacky also highlighted a big financial contribution Newsom received from one of the largest franchisees in the country, which was preceded by an exemption that the Panera Bread magnate got from the state's minimum wage increase that was being implemented at the time.\n\nZacky said the minimum wage increases Californians have been subject to was a major contributing factor to his family business going under.\n\n\"I'm competing on a global market and I have people that are competitors of mine that are producing in Louisiana or Georgia, and it's literally half the price for minimum wage there,\" Zacky explained. \"It got to the point where it was cheaper for them to produce on the other side of the country - put it on a truck, and drive it all the way to California where they could still beat me on price at the grocery store down the street. It's unsustainable.\"\n\nIn response to Zacky's claim that California is not supportive of small businesses, Newsom spokesperson Tara Gallegos highlighted that Zacky Farms filed for bankruptcy in 2012, and later closed in 2018 before fully halting operations in early 2019. Newsom, meanwhile, was not sworn in as governor until January 2019.\n\nCALIFORNIA USING BACK DOOR TO GET FEDERAL FUNDS FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT HEALTHCARE, GOP SATS; DEMS SAY NONSENSE\n\n\"Regardless, claims that California doesn't support business don't stand up to the facts,\" Gallegos said, highlighting data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics that show between Jan. 2019 and Dec. 2024 California created roughly double the number jobs created in Republican-controlled Florida and Texas. \"Our economy is not only booming, but dominating the nation - and we retain one of the most innovative and competitive economies in the world.\"\n\nBut Zacky argued that California's high taxes, burdensome environmental regulations, and other policies Zacky described as \"virtue signaling,\" are making the state less friendly to small business while benefiting bigger ones.\n\n\"When you talk about regulations, you don't really have to look further than [the California Environmental Quality Act] or the California Air Resources Board, which are these governing bodies that inhibit people from growing their businesses as needed, or are restricted based on arbitrary findings all in the name of saving the planet,\" Zacky said. \"No matter what we regulate here in the United States, it doesn't mean China or India or the rest of the developing world is going to play ball and abide by those rules. So you're just hurting people here in America from having that ability to continue to create jobs.\"\n\nAccording to Zacky, before Zacky Farms was forced to shutter, it was the largest private employer in the state for a time.\n\nIn addition to emissions regulations, water access for farmers has been one of those major environmental-focused regulations that Zacky has said is killing small business owners. He pointed to California officials' decision to remove dams in the northern part of the state, which Zacky said was aimed at bringing back a native fish population in the region \"for the 300 Native Americans that inhabit that region.\"\n\n\"You're destroying hydroelectric generation, destroying water reserves, and it's all, again, this virtue signaling nonsense,\" Zacky said, adding that farmers are often forced to cut back on production as a result of the state's water restrictions.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"You see uprooted trees up and down the 99 when you're driving in California, and it's heartbreaking,\" Zacky added. \"It gets to the point where these farmers - you have a lot of small, independent farmers that own 50, 100, 250 acres, who have been there five, six, seven generations, and it becomes unviable for them to sustain their operations so they're forced to sell, and a big conglomerate comes in and buys it up.\"\n\nZacky, who is running for governor as a Republican, faces a big field ahead of him. He will face former Fox News host Steve Hilton in the primary, among others like former Sheriff of Riverside County Chad Bianco and Republican state legislator Brian Dahle.\n\nMeanwhile, former Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra and former Congresswoman Katie Porter are among the Democratic frontrunners. Newsom has reached his term-limit, so he cannot run for reelection.",

    "body": "The biggest funder of the campaign to defeat Proposition 50, Charles Munger Jr., has not contributed any significant cash to the cause in weeks, and his Protect Voters First committee cut its weekly spending from more than $4 million to less than $300. The other opposition committee, Stop Sacramento's Power Grab, spent $155,000 on advertising last week, compared to $3.8 million from Gov. Gavin Newsom's Yes on 50 campaign.\n\n\"It's as full-throated a campaign for Democrats in California as if we were in the middle of a presidential election,\" said Jon Fleischman, a former executive director of the California Republican Party. \"But you can go to the house next door, occupied by Republicans, and it's crickets -- other than receiving their ballot in the mail.\"\n\nThat imbalance represents a turnabout from August, when Newsom first moved his proposed map redraw towards the November ballot. At the time polls showed support for the measure, which became known as Prop 50, hovering precariously just over 50 percent. That appeared beatable by a campaign able to mobilize the Republican base while raising enough money to sway the relatively small slice of persuadable centrists. Former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy vowed to raise $100 million for the enterprise.\n\nInstead Prop 50 opponents have been greatly outmatched in resources and are now bracing for an embarrassing loss. A CBS News poll released last week showed 62 percent of likely voters support the initiative.\n\n\"We still believe that there is a pathway here,\" Jessica Millan Patterson, a former California Republican Party chair leading McCarthy's committee, insisted at an American Association of Political Consultants panel in Long Beach last week. \"Despite being outspent two to one.\"\n\nThe Munger committee, for its part, said it would keep the flame alive, but that \"Charles doesn't discuss strategy until after the election.\"\n\n\"We are continuing to communicate with voters about the value of California's citizen-led redistricting process and will do so until the election is over,\" said Protect Voters First spokesperson Amy Thoma Tan.\n\nMunger, a multi-millionaire good-government philanthropist who backed 2008 and 2010 initiatives that established California's independent redistricting process, has contributed $32 million this year to defend that system. His committee, Protect Voters First, was created soon after Newsom moved to put Prop 50 on the ballot.\n\nHis last major contribution to the campaign was on September 29. Some with knowledge of Munger's spending say that he has not cut back on his contributions because of poor polling, but rather because he reached a predetermined spending limit. Others believe he would have given more had other funders had followed him. No other major donors have emerged to back Protect Voters First.\n\nDiminishing resources have forced Munger's campaign, which initially nearly kept pace with Newsom's spending, to pull back significantly. They have gone from a weekly television advertising budget of between $4 million to $5 million to less than $300 the week of October 21. After inundating YouTube with No on 50 ads throughout September, Protect Voter First has not purchased a single ad on the video platform in October, according to parent company Google's records.\n\nThe McCarthy-led Stop Sacramento's Power Grab has raised just $11 million, primarily from national Republican Party committees and super PACs. Despite early expressions of opposition to Prop 50, President Donald Trump has not taken any significant action to aid the campaign to defeat it, although his administration is now planning to send election monitors to California in what critics have called an act of voter intimidation.\n\n\"Until polls close on November 4, we'll use every available resource to fight back against Newsom's partisan power grab,\" Stop Sacramento Power Grab adviser Ellie Hockenbury said in a statement. With strategists on both sides treating Prop 50's passage as a foregone conclusion, the Republican search for scapegoats appears to have begun.\n\nFleischman, the former party official who now works as an Orange County-based consultant, criticized Republican committees for relying on direct mail to reach voters while conceding the digital sphere to Democrats.\n\n\"I had a friend who just told me about how their 21-year-old son just got a piece of snail mail telling them why Prop 50 is bad,\" Fleischman said on his podcast earlier this month. \"So somebody's wasting money on the Republican side.\"\n\nRepublican Assemblymember Carl DeMaio said that he believed the opposition campaign \"defrauded\" donors with a poor campaign strategy and \"inauthentic\" videos.\n\n\"I knew they were going to waste money,\" he told POLITICO at a No on 50 rally in the Sacramento suburb of Roseville. \"The same people who gave us a superminority are the ones running these committees and profiting off the failure.\"",

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) received 8% support and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker garnered a 6% backing.\n\nNew Hampshire traditionally is the first state to hold both Democratic and Republican presidential primary contests.\n\nThe Democratic National Committee has sought to strip New Hampshire of its first-state status over concerns its population is not diverse enough, but the Granite State is bound by state law to host the opening presidential primary contests.\n\nThe survey of 596 voters who planned to vote in New Hampshire's 2028 Democratic presidential primary found Buttigieg with a double-digit lead over all other Dems in terms of net-favorability.\n\nVoters gave Buttigieg a +75% favorability rating. In other words 81% have a favorable opinion of the ex-Biden administration official, whereas only 6% have an unfavorable opinion of him.\n\nSince leaving office, the former Transportation Secretary has faced criticism for spending $80 billion on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) grants, while allegedly delaying air traffic control upgrades.\n\nUnder Buttigieg, the Department of Transportation also brushed aside safety concerns to approve dozens of windmill projects near highways and railroads -- despite acknowledging potential hazards, The Post reported in July.\n\nSanders had the second-highest net-favorability rating, at +59%, followed by Ocasio-Cortez (+56%), Newsom (+47) and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker (+45%).\n\nHarris, who hinted at mounting another run for the White House in an interview with the BBC over the weekend, pulled in just a +38% net-favorability rating.\n\nOn the Republican side, Vice President JD Vance holds a massive lead, according to the poll.\n\nVance received 51% support from 688 likely voters surveyed, topping former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley (9%), Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard (8%) and Secretary of State Marco Rubio (5%).\n\nThe vice president's net-favorability rating is also best among the pack, at +64%, followed by Rubio (+46%), Gabbard (+46%), and Florida Gov.

    "body": "Texas Rep. Wesley Hunt accused the California governor of \"talking down\" to Black people after his recent podcast appearance.\n\nRep. Wesley Hunt (R-TX) has accused California Governor Gavin Newsom (D) of \"code-switching\" his accent to try to appeal to Black people.\n\nAppearing Monday on conservative political commentator Benny Johnson's podcast \"The Benny Show,\" the conversation kicked off after host Johnson slammed Newsom for supposedly trying to alter his voice after the governor recently appeared on the \"All the Smoke\" podcast hosted by ex-NBA players Matt Barnes and Stephen Jackson.\n\nAfter Johnson called Newsom an \"elitist, white left-wing lib[eral]\" and argued that he's \"never heard him talk like this before\" the politician's appearance on the podcast, Hunt bluntly responded, \"We call this code-switching.\"\n\nJohnson then interjected to continue poking fun at the \"cringe\" interview, asking Hunt why he thinks \"this happens so much.\"\n\n\"This is exactly what you nailed. This is the efforts of white benevolent liberals that don't view us as equal at all -- and by us, I mean Black people,\" Hunt said. \"They talk down to us. They think we are too stupid to get an ID to vote, they think that we're incapable of following the law, they always want to give us handouts instead of hand-ups.\"\n\nThe GOP representative went on to declare that the \"white, benevolent liberal\" is the \"most racist person\" that he's \"ever seen in the history of this country.\"\n\nArguing that \"many of them don't even know it,\" Hunt continued: \"The condescending tone in which they address us is utterly ridiculous.\"\n\n\"They think they can now talk to two Black basketball stars and then now all of a sudden 'I'm a brother now too because I'm hip and I'm down,'\" he continued. \"And to be honest with you, it's quite condescending, it's actually quite disgusting.\"\n\nNoting that \"Black men can think for ourselves,\" Hunt added, \"The only thing I want from you is to treat us as equals and to respect us.\"\n\nNewsom's office didn't immediately respond to HuffPost's request for comment.\n\nDuring his interview on \"All the Smoke,\" which aired on Oct. 25, Newsom opened up about his childhood and detailed being raised by his mother who he said \"came from no money and just hustled\" with \"two and a half jobs\" to pay the bills.\n\n\"It was also about paying the bills, man. It was just like hustling, and so I was out there kind of raising myself, turning on the TV ... started, you know, just getting obsessed. [I was] sitting there with the Wonder Bread,\" he said.\n\nNewsom's remarks drew laughter from hosts Barnes and Jackson, who said he could relate, prompting the California Democrat to double down on sharing memories of his childhood.\n\n\"Come on, the macaroni and cheese. This is how I grew up, bro. Every day in the backyard just bouncing the basketball, throwing the ball against the wall until the ball is just like frayed...that's it. Whole thing,\" Newsom added.\n\nNewsom's remarks faced backlash online, with some X users pointing out that the political leader's dad, William Newsom, worked as an attorney for the Getty oil company.\n\nA spokesperson for Newsom fired back at the criticism.\n\n\"Anyone with more than an inch of curiosity would know that Governor Newsom was raised by his mother after her divorce from his father when he was a toddler,\" the spokesperson said in a statement to the Daily Mail. \"He has talked about moving between two different worlds, but he was raised by a mother who worked three jobs at one point -- secretary, waitress, and paralegal.\"",

Gavin Newsom is sending $140 million to seven Planned Parenthood affiliates in the state so they can continue healthcare services.\n\nCalifornia is providing $140 million to seven cash-strapped Planned Parenthood affiliates in California to provide reproductive care -- a move that won't be enough to restore the nonprofit's shuttered Melody Health primary care services in Southern California.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom announced the financial lifeline Thursday, Oct. 23, not long after Planned Parenthood of Orange and San Bernardino Counties said it was shuttering seven clinics and laying off 81 workers by Dec. 13.\n\nEarlier this month, Planned Parenthood said it was closing Melody Health because of the Trump administration's defunding efforts. The layoffs include physicians, nurses and administrative staff. About 450 healthcare professionals and administrative staff will be left with Planned Parenthood after Melody Health winds down.\n\nThe defunding came after Congressional Republicans passed President Donald Trump's \"One Big, Beautiful Bill Act.\" The law includes a provision that restricts federal funding for Planned Parenthood Federation of America or any of its affiliates or clinics for one year. That provision was paused under a court injunction in July, but was restored when the court order was stayed Sept. 11. Congress, as it stands, will renew the defunding provision annually.\n\nNichole Ramirez, chief communications and transformation officer with the local Planned Parenthood group, said that even if the nonprofit received a $20 million split of the $140 million offered by the state it would still need to make more belt-tightening moves because the Trump administration also blocked the state from receiving $300 million in federal Medicaid funds.\n\nMedicaid provides healthcare coverage for eligible low-income children and their families, pregnant women, seniors and people with disabilities.\n\nThe local Planned Parenthood affiliate was receiving about $50 million out of its total annual operating budget of $100 million from the federal government, meaning that it would still need to make up a $30 million deficit from somewhere else, Ramirez said. \"Right now we're just living off our reserves,\" Ramirez said.\n\nThe exact amount of money that Planned Parenthood is expected to receive locally is unknown, as Newsom didn't say when and how much each of the affiliates would receive, Ramirez said.\n\n\"We're grateful for the funds, but we know that this is only meant to be a temporary solution,\" she said. \"In order to stay open, we will need to work with the California legislature when they return in January on a longer-term fix to make up what was lost when the Trump administration defunded Planned Parenthood.\"\n\nThe cash infusion ensures that Planned Parenthood can still perform millions of annual gynecological exams, screenings for breast and cervical cancer, Pap smears to detect cell changes in a cervix, birth control, insert intrauterine devices, sexually transmitted infection testing and treatment, HIV testing, urinary tract infection testing and treatment and abortion care.\n\nIn 2026, Newsom and legislative leaders intend to identify additional resources so that Planned Parenthood health centers can continue to provide services to Californians.\n\nKrista Hollinger, chief executive officer of Planned Parenthood of Orange and San Bernardino Counties, previously said terminating Melody Health would affect more than 13,000 patients enrolled at its seven clinics in Orange and San Bernardino counties. The clinics provide primary care services such as annual wellness checks, cold and flu treatment, vaccines, diabetes management, vaccinations and behavioral health services.\n\nAll nine of Planned Parenthood health centers in Orange and San Bernardino counties will remain open for reproductive care services.",

    "title": "Adam Carolla Rips 'World Class Douchebag' Gavin Newsom for Fabricating Story About Growing Up Poor on Podcast With Black NBA Legends",
    "body": "Podcaster and comedian Adam Carolla pounded radical California Democrat Governor Gavin Newsom as a \"world class douchebag\" for fabricating a story about growing up poor during an appearance on a podcast hosted by black NBA icons.\n\nCarolla ripped Newsom as an inauthentic \"world class douchebag\" who has \"no personality other than the personality he perceives other people wanting him to have when he's in the room with them. So, when he's in the room with the brothers, let's talk about mac-n-cheese and sandwiches.\"\n\nCarolla's comments ripping Newsom come after the California Gov. appeared on a podcast with ex-NBA players Matt Barnes and Stephen Jackson. Newsom claimed he had a hard childhood, grew up \"hustiln,'\" and was \"out there kind of raising myself,\" all as if he had a harsdscrabble, poverty-stricken, lower-class life as a child.\n\n\"Kraft macaroni and cheese, that's how I grew up, bro,\" Newsom exclaimed.\n\nBut Carolla wasn't about to let Newsom get away with portraying his privileged life as some sort of downtrodden ordeal.\n\n\"You should know his dad was lead counsel for Getty Oil. Getty is like the richest family in the country, maybe in the world... his dad was a judge and a lawyer, and the Gettys were close family friends,\" Carolla told his audience.\n\nHe added, \"And when he started his winery at 25, he got the money from the Getty family -- just like you and I did when we were 25,\" Carolla joked.\n\nThe truth is, Gavin Newsom grew up in ritzy Marin County, California. And Larkspur, where he went to high school, has a median household income of $135,000. That is 60 percent higher than the average U.S. household nationally.\n\nNewsom is scrambling to get the leg up on the 2028 Democrat presidential nomination campaign after a recent poll found that he is losing to two-time loser Kamala Harris in the Democrat and independent polls for 2028.",

    "title": "The California Election That Could Tip Congress",
    "body": "When I found Darshan Smaaladen earlier this month, she had joined several hundred of her neighbors at a \"No Kings\" demonstration in Orange County, California. Not that she was there to protest. \"Rallies are great,\" Smaaladen told me, \"but they don't get people out to vote.\"\n\nA year ago, Smaaladen had helped lead a successful campaign to recall two ultraconservative members of Orange County's school board. Now the 52-year-old mother of three was using the \"No Kings\" protest as a campaigning ground for Proposition 50, the ballot measure orchestrated by Governor Gavin Newsom that would redraw California's district map to add as many as five Democratic seats to the party's column in Congress. The outcome of the November 4 referendum could determine whether Democrats have a real shot at winning back the House in next year's midterm elections.\n\nAdvocates and opponents of Prop 50 have already spent more than $200 million on ads starring political luminaries such as Barack Obama and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on the \"yes\" side and Arnold Schwarzenegger on the \"no\" side. In an era of permanent campaigning, this race has become the closest thing America has to a snap election: At Newsom's urging, the California legislature placed the initiative on this fall's ballot in August as a response to Republican gerrymandering in Texas and elsewhere, directed by Donald Trump and his allies.\n\nThe campaign's final weeks have turned into a statewide scramble to persuade California voters to temporarily override the independent redistricting commission that they approved less than two decades ago. The Democratic Party's organizers have found plenty of voters who are eager for the chance to stand against the president and, in Newsom's words, \"fight fire with fire\" in the gerrymandering wars. \"When you talk to people, it's not nuanced. Democrats react really well to an anti-Trump message,\" Florice Hoffman, the chair of the Democratic Party in Orange County, told me.\n\nRead: How Democrats tied their own hands on redistricting\n\nBut organizers have also encountered a worrisome amount of confusion and apathy among Democrats who are not yet sold on matching the GOP's ruthlessness, Smaaladen told me. \"Democrats are a group that loves transparency and equity,\" she explained. \"And so lining things up in a way that's nonequitable is difficult. It takes a few steps to get people to understand that it's not just about California. It's about the nation.\"\n\nThe Democrats' simplest message is to make the election about Trump, who is leaning on Republican lawmakers to aggressively gerrymander as many states as they can in the hopes of pushing the House majority out of reach for Democrats. In addition to remapping Texas, the GOP has already redrawn the lines in Missouri and North Carolina, and it could target seats in Ohio, Indiana, Kansas, and Florida in the coming months. Democrats will try to redraw the map in Virginia and might try to squeeze additional seats out of their strongholds in Maryland and Illinois, but they have fewer opportunities to gerrymander than Republicans do.\n\nCalifornia is by far the Democratic Party's best chance to cut into the GOP's nationwide advantage. In addition to targeting five seats that Republicans currently hold, the Democrats' proposal would shore up several of the party's incumbents in competitive districts. GOP lawmakers in Texas were able to redraw the state's map on their own. Yet in California, because a 2010 referendum took redistricting power away from state legislators, Democrats have to put their plan to a vote. Prop 50 would implement a newly gerrymandered map that would hold until the next decennial census, in 2030, when an independent commission would again draw the lines. \"There is no Plan B,\" Representative Pete Aguilar, the third-highest-ranking House Democrat, whose district includes the Inland Empire, east of Los Angeles, told me. \"We have to win this.\" I asked Aguilar if Democrats could still win the House majority next year if the measure fails. He said they could, but \"it would be incredibly, incredibly hard.\"\n\nRepublicans have tried to counter the Democrats' anti-Trump campaign by framing the ballot initiative as a power grab by Newsom and the opening shot to his all-but-certain 2028 bid for the presidency. But to win in such a heavily Democratic state, a partisan appeal won't be sufficient. \"The challenge for the opposition,\" says Dan Schnur, a longtime GOP strategist in California who is now an independent, is convincing voters \"that their belief in democratic reform is as strong as their feelings about Trump.\"\n\nAs I traveled around Orange County -- the state's most closely divided political battleground -- I heard a version of the same argument from critics of Prop 50. \"I believe they're wrong in allowing Texas to do what they're doing,\" Mary Kay McElmeel, a retired real-estate agent, told me in Mission Viejo. But, she added, \"if somebody does wrong, you don't try to do a bigger wrong.\"\n\nWhen Smaaladen hears this line while speaking with voters, she turns the conversation toward parenting. \"I've always told my children never to hit people. But if somebody were to bully your child on the playground and assault them, that child has a right to hit back,\" she told me. \"I believe that Texas assaulted democracy and that California is allowed to hit back.\"\n\n\"So sometimes,\" Smaaladen concluded, \"two wrongs do make a right.\"\n\nWill O'Neill, the 42-year-old former mayor of Newport Beach, was standing in the middle of a quiet street on a chilly morning earlier this month, complaining about all the evils of gerrymandering. \"We need voters to have the ability to push back on their representatives when they get too far out of line,\" he told me. \"And congressional gerrymandering for partisan purposes tends to lead to more extreme outcomes. It's not good for communities.\"\n\nIf the argument sounds familiar, it's because Democrats spent the first two years of Joe Biden's presidency making it, as part of their failed effort to ban gerrymandering across the country. But O'Neill is no Democrat: He's the chair of the Republican Party of Orange County. O'Neill had brought me to this unusual meeting spot in Mission Viejo because the congressional map that Democrats have proposed for California includes a district line drawn down the center of the suburban street we were standing on. If the measure passes, the houses on one side of the street would fall into a Democratic district that's currently represented by Dave Min, and the houses on the other side would stay with GOP Representative Young Kim. Other lines, O'Neill told me, cut through backyards.\n\nIt's not actually all that unusual for a congressional district to bisect a street; map makers in both parties are notorious for drawing lines that split communities of interest, stretch hundreds of miles in one direction or another, and generally look silly on paper. Courts have repeatedly struck down Republican-drawn maps on the grounds that they constitute illegal racial gerrymanders designed to dilute the electoral power of Black voters, who overwhelmingly cast Democratic ballots. To O'Neill, the crude partitioning of Mission Viejo is evidence of the Democrats' haste and hypocrisy. \"You can't say that you're keeping communities of interest together at the same time you're drawing maps like that,\" he said.\n\nO'Neill isn't necessarily wrong. Democrats readily concede that they are betraying principles of good governance in trying to gerrymander California. But in the face of Trump's naked aggression, they no longer care. \"I support and love an independent redistricting commission. I want one in all 50 states,\" Aguilar told me. But, he said, \"I'm tired of Democrats disarming and doing the right thing while 42 other states play by a different set of rules. It's just ridiculous.\"\n\nTo motivate their base, Republicans are trying to make a distinction between what Texas did to its map and what Newsom has proposed for California. In Texas, they argue, Republican lawmakers were acting to avoid a lawsuit by the Trump administration, which wrote a letter to Governor Greg Abbott accusing the state of using a congressional map that violated the Voting Rights Act. California is facing no such threat.\n\n\"California and Texas are completely different scenarios,\" Mark Meuser, a lawyer who plans to challenge California's new map in court should voters approve it, told me. Meuser was in Laguna Hills to speak at a luncheon of the Southern California Area Republican Women, where he made an impassioned case that although Texas Republicans had been merely trying to fix unconstitutional districts, California Democrats would be taking a perfectly legal congressional map and rendering it unconstitutional.\n\nThe argument was a hit with his audience, a group of staunch Republicans who ate their salads in a hotel ballroom decorated with cardboard cutouts of Trump. And Meuser hopes that if the case makes it to the Supreme Court, the conservative majority will agree with him. But politically, it's quite a stretch. Meuser works for the law firm founded by Harmeet Dhillon, a California Republican who left to become the Trump administration's assistant attorney general for civil rights. In that role, Dhillon wrote the July letter that launched this year's nationwide gerrymandering battle, informing Abbott that the Justice Department believed several Texas districts constituted \"illegal racial gerrymanders\" under the Voting Rights Act.\n\nDhillon's objection was both creative and, to the administration's critics, deeply cynical, considering that the Trump administration is urging the Supreme Court to weaken the same voting protections it accused Texas of violating. In the months since, Republicans in Texas and Washington, D.C., have acknowledged that the Dhillon letter is little more than legal pretext for a political power play. \"I got the highest vote in the history of Texas, and we are entitled to five more seats,\" Trump said in August.\n\nListen: If the Voting Rights Act falls\n\nThe president's candor doesn't help his party's cause in California. After Meuser's speech, I asked him whether Trump's statements -- and similar admissions by other Republicans -- make his task harder. \"It shouldn't, but probably to some degree it does. Judges are human beings,\" Meuser replied. \"The political narrative -- I can't just wash it away.\"\n\nMeuser's frustration is a familiar feeling for Republicans in California, who could end up suffering for the national party's redistricting offensive. No Republican has won a statewide election in nearly 20 years; the state GOP's most influential federal official, former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, was booted after just nine months in 2023. After next year's midterms, if Prop 50 passes, Republicans might hold just four of California's 52 House seats.\n\nIn Washington, Republicans now wield more power than they have in more than a century. But as their statewide clout continues to diminish, California Republicans can celebrate only so much. Kira Davis, a GOP podcaster and member of the club Meuser spoke to, compared the awkward dynamic to \"waking up with your dad's new family on Christmas morning.\"\n\n\"All of his new kids are opening their PlayStation 5 and their remote-control cars,\" Davis told me afterward, \"and you're in the corner opening the lump of coal in your stocking. That's what it feels like to be a Republican in California.\"\n\nLong a bastion of Reagan Republicanism, the sprawling suburbs south of Los Angeles have shifted leftward during the 21st century. Orange County's population is now close to evenly split among white, Latino, and Asian residents, and beginning in 2018, Democrats narrowly overtook Republicans in registration advantage. Since then, its congressional races have been some of the hardest-fought -- and most expensive -- in the country. \"Orange County has become the quintessential purple county in America,\" Jon Gould, the dean of UC Irvine's School of Social Ecology, told me. \"All of the trends that we have seen in American politics over the last 30 years show up, and in some cases, show up first in Orange County.\"\n\nAlthough Kamala Harris narrowly carried the county last year, the margin was much lower than Biden's edge over Trump in 2020. In a rare point of pride for local Republicans, their Senate candidate, the former Dodgers and Padres star Steve Garvey, won more votes than Adam Schiff in Orange County, even as Schiff won in a rout statewide.\n\nDemocrats know that they can pass Prop 50 without carrying Orange County. But a win there would guarantee victory statewide, and the county party sees the campaign as an unexpected opportunity to reconnect with voters who soured on Democrats and stayed home in last year's election. \"This is an organizer's dream,\" Jeffrey Cárdenas, the Orange County Democrats' organizing director, told me. \"It's exactly what we needed.\"\n\nJonathan Lemire: Fear of losing the midterms is driving Trump's decisions\n\nWe were speaking at the party's county headquarters in Anaheim, where on a Wednesday night a small group of volunteers was phone banking. A half-eaten pizza sat on the table, and the volunteers rang a bell every time they secured another commitment of support. Louise Larsen was making calls to Democrats in her GOP-leaning community of Westminster, trying to recruit volunteers to knock on doors. She told me that she understood the unease over the initiative but that she didn't want \"to give Trump one more crumb of leverage\" in Washington. \"We've got to do what we've got to do\" to win back power, Larsen told me. \"And then we can play fair.\"\n\nCárdenas told me that the number of no-shows at canvassing events -- what organizers call the \"flake rate\" -- was much lower than in the past. \"Our base is fired up,\" he said. Still, he wasn't quite ready to predict victory.\n\nPolling has trended in the \"yes\" side's direction lately: A CBS News survey released last week found that 62 percent of California respondents were planning to vote for Prop 50, up from a slim majority in polls earlier in October. Historically, undecided voters tend to break against contentious ballot measures in California. Yet Prop 50 is different from most other referenda because its support is so tied to party lines. Californians also have to want to vote for the measure -- it's the only thing on the ballot this year.\n\nLast week, the Department of Justice announced that it will monitor polling sites in five California locations, including Orange County, next month. Republicans have also been growing more pessimistic as the election nears. \"Watch how totally dishonest the California Prop vote is!\" Trump fumed on Truth Social over the weekend.\n\nOn the day I met Darshan Smaaladen, she had deployed canvassers to knock on doors on the streets surrounding the \"No Kings\" rally; their list included the houses of Republicans and independents. As we walked, the volunteers told me they had generally been encouraged by the support they'd found for Prop 50. But the compressed nature of the campaign was evident in the confusion they encountered among some voters -- especially those who have not closely followed the news. One canvasser said she had swayed some Democrats who wrongly assumed the party wanted them to vote \"no.\" Faye Carroll, a retiree in her 80s, told the volunteers that she would definitely be voting but needed to read more about the issue. When I asked her what she thought about the Republican gerrymandering in Texas that had spawned the ballot initiative, Carroll replied, \"I didn't know about that.\"\n\nOne of the canvassers, a 51-year-old history teacher named Heather Chapman, said the group has also met Democrats who don't particularly like the referendum and the brass-knuckle politics it represents. These are the voters who could ultimately decide its fate and, with their choice, tip the balance of power in Congress. \"They're like, 'In normal times, I would so not be for this. This is not how it's supposed to work,'\" Chapman told me. To that she simply replies: \"Yeah, there is nothing about this that's normal.\"",

    "title": "How lawmakers are riding the Prop 50 bandwagon",
    "body": "THE PROP 50 UNDERSTUDIES -- Gov. Gavin Newsom may be the main character of the campaign to pass Proposition 50, but behind him is a growing cast of supporting actors jostling for their moment on stage. Nearly 40 different yes committees have emerged or rebranded to join Newsom's fight, with a slew of Democratic state lawmakers -- including Speaker Robert Rivas -- using their ballot committees to run Yes on 50 ads putting them in the spotlight before constituents.\n\nThis isn't quite the same as billionaire donor Tom Steyer casting himself in primetime Prop 50 spots or mall magnate and perennial rumor-mill supplier Rick Caruso plastering his face on Prop 50 mailers. While team Caruso gave team Newsom a heads up, both spurred cynical reactions from other Democrats who accused them of belatedly riding the initiative bandwagon toward their own potential candidacies for governor or mayor/governor, respectively.\n\nIncumbent state lawmakers coordinated with the Newsom mothership and are hewing to its messaging.\n\n\"Love the support,\" senior adviser Jim DeBoo said in a text message. \"They actually voted for this. They took a risk when this didn't look easy so if they want to get behind their vote we are all for it. And someone like Rivas who has name ID in his district it's smart and helpful.\"\n\nBut that doesn't make the ad campaigns any less opportunistic. Through ballot measure committees, politicians can raise unlimited funds from Sacramento interest groups to raise their profiles between election cycles. A few of the lawmakers now putting committees to work are rumored to have an eye on political promotions.\n\nThat includes Rivas, whose Central Coast district overlaps with that of Rep. Zoe Lofgren. The speaker last week began showing his constituents a television ad in which he characterizes Prop 50 as a way for Californians to push back on Trump's \"tyrant\"-like approach to immigration enforcement. Rivas spokeswoman Elizabeth Ashford said a future House run was \"not a scenario we are thinking about,\" noting Rivas had endorsed his longtime ally Lofgren for re-election and insisting Rivas was \"100% focused on being speaker.\"\n\nAshford said Rivas' ad would bolster the broader Yes on 50 turnout push because Rivas is \"uniquely positioned\" to talk to his rural district, where ICE raids have taken a heavy toll on farmworkers like Rivas' late grandfather, whom he mentions in the spot. Gonzalez had a similar argument for casting himself in an ad that links to a website depicting a clash between him and Trump, saying he was a \"validator\" for his Los Angeles constituents.\n\n\"There's a familiarity in my district,\" Gonzalez said.\n\nThere are many ways for lawmakers to lend their committees to the effort. Senate President Pro Tem Mike McGuire sent a six-figure check from his insurance commissioner to Yes on 50, which would birth a new House district in McGuire's part of the state. State Sen. Tim Grayson and Assemblymembers Jesse Gabriel and Blanca Pacheco have been running pro-Prop 50 ads in which they appear. Republican Assembly member Carl DeMaio has revved up his Reform California machine, hosting No on 50 rallies across the state.\n\nDemocratic Assembly member Tina McKinnor has worked with fellow Black electeds to channel her ballot committee bucks -- largely from organized labor -- toward turning out Black voters in multiple Los Angeles districts, including her own.\n\n\"It's about letting Black people know this affects us if we don't get Congress back in the midterms,\" McKinnor said. \"I was listening to a lot of the messaging and I have to admit, some of it did not resonate with the Black community.\"\n\nBut images have a special resonance, conveying to disillusioned Democratic voters that their representatives understand a profound desire for the party to take on Trump.\n\n\"It's an opportunity for state leaders to send a message to their constituents that 'I'm not sitting on the sidelines. I'm fighting back,'\" said Dave Jacobson, a political consultant whose clients appear in several ads. \"It's a win-win for these California lawmakers.\"\n\nNEWS BREAK: Southern California fire risk rises this week...PG&E plans expansion in San Jose...U.S. transportation secretary threatens to withhold funds over California truck license law.\n\nWelcome to Ballot Measure Weekly, a special edition of Playbook PM focused on California's lively realm of ballot measure campaigns. Drop me a line at [email protected] or find me on X -- @wrmccart.\n\nA highly subjective ranking of the ballot measures -- past and future, certain and possible -- getting our attention this week.\n\n1. Chatbot child safety (2026): Online-safety advocates have filed an initiative aimed at protecting young people from AI chatbots and holding tech companies accountable for any harm they cause to kids, POLITICO's Chase DiFeliciantonio reports. Former U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy and Common Sense Media CEO Jim Steyer spearheaded the measure after Newsom vetoed a Steyer-backed bill focused on kids' chatbot safety.\n\n2. Ride-hailing tax (San Francisco, 2026): Connie Chan and three other San Francisco supervisors unveiled a city initiative Friday that would raise taxes on ride-hailing companies, including autonomous vehicle services like Waymo, and reinstate the previous way the city taxed highly paid executives, Chase is also reporting. The measure will appear on the November 2026 ballot.\n\n3. CEQA overhaul (2026): The California Chamber of Commerce is proposing an initiative to overhaul the state's broadest environmental law. The proposal, filed last week, would build on anti-CEQA momentum to streamline its process for \"essential projects\" by removing red tape and blocking NIMBY lawsuits.\n\n4. Vacancy tax (San Diego city, 2026?): San Diego City Council is considering a tax on second and vacant homes, voting to draft a version of a measure that would boost the city's general fund. The proposal is likely to pick a fight with real estate agents across the state, who have successfully organized to defeat similar measures in other cities in recent years.\n\n5. Billionaire tax (2026): SEIU-UHW is back with its third initiative of the cycle, now proposing to plug holes in the state's health care budget shortfall by imposing a one-time, 5 percent excise tax on the wealthiest Californians. The so-called \"billionaire tax\" is intended to restore Medi-Cal funding and other health programs, with the remaining funds allocated for the public education system. Other SEIU-UHW initiatives to place restrictions on hospital executive pay and clinic funding have been cleared for circulation.\n\n6. Voter ID (2026?): DeMaio is touting a \"record-breaking haul\" of 300,000 signatures in the first 20 days of petition-gathering for a constitutional amendment to require government-issued identification when voting, putting his Reform California organization one-third of the way to the 2026 ballot with months left to go.\n\n7. Prop 2 (2024): An education bond approved by voters last year is the target of a lawsuit by Public Advocates, arguing that its construction projects are discriminating against poor communities, reports POLITICO's Eric He. The lawsuit aims to halt certain funding for school facilities until lawmakers rethink the way money is allocated so that it \"delivers education opportunity equitably,\" according to Public Advocates managing attorney John Affeldt.\n\nOur manic attempt to keep up with the Prop 50 advertising wars, in old media and new.\n\nThe Newsom-led Yes on 50 was the country's largest political advertiser on Google last week, spending more than $1.7 million across the company's platforms. That's nearly three times more than any entity trying to shape gubernatorial races in New Jersey or Virginia ... Stop Sacramento's Power Grab is filling the digital void left by Charles Munger, Jr.'s increasingly quiet Protect Voters First. The Kevin McCarthy-led committee shifted its persuasion messaging to all-Arnold-all-the-time this weekend, pulling clips of Schwarzenegger's appearance on \"Real Time with Bill Maher\" for its pre-roll ads on YouTube... The California Republican Party, the no side's chosen get-out-the-vote vehicle, began running a series of ads on Facebook this weekend encouraging voters to return their ballots. Most feature Newsom and warn of backroom deals, calling Prop 50 an insider \"con\"... Two unions targeting school-based employees are embracing very different closing messages online: the California Teachers Association's Facebook ads ask voters to \"defend California's schools\" by striking a blow against cuts by a Republican Congress, while those from SEIU-led Education Workers United show a bear wearing what appears to be a Mexican-flag neckerchief chasing an ICE officer...Other groups getting in on the digital GOTV action with Facebook buys include the California Native Vote Project, MomsRising.org, California Working Families Party, and CA Black Power Network.\n\nPROP 67 (2016): Ten years after voters approved a ballot measure to ban single-use plastic bags in the state, Californians in the new year will finally bid adieu to the once ubiquitous shopping bag.\n\nIn 2016, voters chose to uphold a statewide bag ban established two years earlier by Gov. Jerry Brown, shooting down industry-backed referendum Prop 67 by a 6 percentage point margin. Although many grocers, including Trader Joe's and Whole Foods Markets, have since switched permanently to paper, some turned to a loophole that allowed them to sell slightly thicker, but still not very recyclable, bags to shoppers. A statewide investigation initiated by Attorney General Rob Bonta in 2022 questioned certain companies' usage of the recycling symbol and recyclable claims, leading to a settlement last week in which four companies paid $1.7 million to the state and were forced to stop selling plastic bags in California.\n\nIn 2024, after years of jousting with plastics producers, lawmakers passed SB 1053, which closes the loophole that still allowed for the thicker plastic bags that proliferated during the pandemic. The law will take effect on Jan. 1.\n\nA legislatively referred ballot measure asking Virginia voters to enshrine abortion rights in the state constitution in 2026 appears likely to pass if Democrats can maintain their narrow majority in the state's House of Delegates when all its seats are up for grabs next week... Former Oregon Gov. Ted Kulongoski, a Democrat, has thrown his support behind two initiatives that would open the state's primary elections -- a shift that election reformers have been pushing for nearly two decades.\n\nOne year after voters in Massachusetts approved a ballot measure that no longer required high school students to pass a statewide standardized test in order to graduate, officials are considering an early proposal that would replace it...Four University of Arkansas students have filed a constitutional amendment establishing a \"fundamental right to a clean and healthy environment.\" The proposal, which mimics language in Montana's constitution, would require the Legislature to create laws to protect wildlife and natural resources and provide residents new tools to challenge laws that don't.\n\n... LONG BEACH: Voters across California are returning their ballots for an election that countless advertisements have warned them could decide the fate of democracy. In Long Beach, a minor-league baseball team is following the same process to determine whether they should be named after the colorful parrots that fly through town.\n\nThe seaside Los Angeles-area city has long been a big baseball town. The Long Beach State Dirtbags, of the local Cal State campus, has a storied history. Major League legends the late Tony Gwynn and Jason Giambi are known for their roots in the city.\n\nBut it's also a city that has an equally rich history of letting citizens participate in the lawmaking process. In addition to voting on numerous ballot measures over the years, Long Beach recently established a participatory budgeting process to encourage public engagement in fiscal policy.\n\n\"I love all that direct-democracy stuff,\" said Mayor Rex Richardson.\n\nThe city will now get a new minor-league team, playing in the Pioneer Baseball League, that will begin playing in the Pioneer Baseball League, an MLB partner, next May. Now known simply as Long Beach Baseball Club, the team initially brought a series of naming ideas to city hall. Richardson said he was not particularly excited about any of them (although he declined to say what they were), suggesting instead that the community weigh in.\n\nAnd so they have been, in a mock ballot-measure experiment in which residents of Long Beach -- or, honestly, anyone passing through town, as there's no voter-registration process -- can cast a ballot. Nearly 5,000 ballots were cast in the first round of voting this fall, which narrowed possible names to the Coast, the Parrots, or the Regulators.\n\nAccording to team president Ena Patel, there was some initial concern about the direct democracy experiment getting away from the team (think, Boaty McBoatface or NASA Space Station Colbert). The team reserved the right to diverge from the majority vote based on how the name \"is brand aligned with the parent companies portfolio\" and other practicalities like trademarks -- but she pledged that it would be one of the three finalists.\n\nVoting ends on Wednesday at midnight, and voters can participate online or make their way to polling places in breweries, gyms, or the city's airport to cast their ballot. A winner will be announced in November. According to Richardson, some low-stakes democracy is just what his city could use right now.\n\n\"In general, fear is a big reason that people vote for things -- it's to prevent something from happening, or it's because they're afraid of something happening,\" he said. \"But optimism is also a great way to get public participation.\"",

REUTERS/Evelyn Hockstein\n\nCalifornia Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom took a swing Monday at President Donald Trump's health claims, saying \"most people don't take that many cognitive tests unless a doctor is worried\" -- adding to the recent jabs at the president's cognitive and physical health.\n\nTrump, 79, announced during a flight on Air Force One that he was recently at Walter Reed Medical Center for an aptitude test, The Daily Beast reports.\n\nAnd Newsom \"isn't afraid to say the quiet part out loud\" and responded on X, according to The Beast.\n\nThe test reportedly asked Trump to sketch a clock, recognize animal photos and repeat five words in a list. The exam is apparently designed \"to detect mild cognitive impairment as early as possible.\" It is not used as a way to measure IQ or intelligence.\n\nTrump then challenged Democratic Reps. Jasmine Crockett (D-TX) and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) to take the same exam. He also admitted that he struggled with it.\n\n\"Have [Ocasio-Cortez] pass the exams that I decided to take when I was at Walter Reed,\" he said. \"Those are very hard -- they're really aptitude tests, I guess, in a certain way, but they're cognitive tests. Let AOC go against Trump. Let Jasmine go against Trump.\"\n\nNewsom also responded on X to Trump's Truth Social post over the weekend, after he landed in Malaysia, about how pregnant women should avoid Tylenol.\n\n\"Won't be taking medical advice from someone who can't spell hepatitis and looks like this,\" Newsom said, posting a photo of Trump taking off his suit jacket.",

    "body": "Fox News correspondent Christina Coleman reports on former Vice President Kamala Harris' book tour and interview with the BBC on 'Fox News Live.'\n\nCalifornia Democrat Gov. Gavin Newsom and former Vice President Kamala Harris both remarked in the past few days that they're keeping their options open for potential 2028 presidential runs.\n\n\"Yeah, I'd be lying otherwise,\" Newsom told \"CBS News Sunday Morning\" when asked if he would give \"serious thought\" to a 2028 presidential run after the 2026 midterms. \"I'd just be lying. And I'm not -- I can't do that.\"\n\n\"I have no idea,\" Newsom said of whether he would decide to run, adding that he has not let academic struggles from across his life prevent him from working to ascend the political ladder. \"The idea that a guy who got 960 on his SAT, that still struggles to read scripts, that was always in the back of the classroom, the idea that you would even throw that out is, in and of itself, extraordinary. Who the hell knows? I'm looking forward to who presents themselves in 2028 and who meets that moment. And that's the question for the American people.\"\n\nNewsom long has been floated as a likely Democrat nominee for the presidency, most notably after the unprecedented 2024 race when President Joe Biden dropped out of the running amid heightened concerns over his mental acuity, and then-Vice President Harris took up the mantle in his absence. President Donald Trump ultimately swept the seven battleground states and won the popular vote and the Electoral College.\n\nGOV. GAVIN NEWSOM REVEALS WHEN HE'LL START THINKING ABOUT A POTENTIAL 2028 RUN\n\nHarris also left the door open to a potential 2028 presidential run while speaking with the BBC in an interview that aired Saturday. Harris is a longtime California Democrat who has served as San Francisco district attorney, the California attorney general, and a U.S. senator representing California before ascending the political landscape as the nation's vice president in 2021.\n\n\"I am not done,\" Harris told the UK outlet. \"I have lived my entire career as a life of service, and it's in my bones.\"\n\nHarris said during the interview that her grand-nieces would see the first female president \"in their lifetime, for sure,\" and that she could \"possibly\" be that woman, according to the BBC.\n\nHarris brushed off polling that shows her as a 2028 Democrat outsider, saying during the interview that she historically has not listened to polling data.\n\nKAMALA HARRIS TO PUBLISH BEHIND-THE-SCENES ACCOUNT OF FAILED 2024 CAMPAIGN\n\n\"If I listened to polls I would have not run for my first office, or my second office -- and I certainly wouldn't be sitting here.\"\n\nThe 2024 presidential election threw the Democrat Party into a tailspin as it continues searching for its next de facto leader. Harris published a memoir in September detailing her 107 days on the campaign trail after Biden dropped out of the race, which included a handful of shots at the former president that has caused rifts within the party to grow deeper as it looks for fresh leadership.\n\nKAMALA HARRIS' MAJOR CALIFORNIA ANNOUNCEMENT TRIGGERS CIRCULAR DEM FIRING SQUAD\n\nBoth Newsom and Harris are longtime political foes of Trump, who has railed against both of them for promoting left-wing West Coast policies, including on the national stage.\n\nTrump, who is term limited and in the midst of his second presidency, welcomed a potential Newsom presidential run back in May, but said the California high-speed rail project intended to connect San Francisco and Los Angeles would prevent him from proceeding in a presidential race.\n\n\"I would love him to run for president,\" he said. \"I'd love to see that, but I don't think he's going to be running because that one project alone -- well, that, and the fires and a lot of other things -- pretty much put him out of the race.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe \"one project alone\" refers to the high-speed rail project that has been plagued by delays and increased costs, with the Trump administration pulling the funding plug on the project in July.\n\nFox News Digital reached out to Newsom's and Harris' respective offices Monday morning for additional comment on their 2028 remarks and has yet to receive replies.",

    "title": "Column: Trump's antics helping supporters of Prop. 50",
    "body": "SACRAMENTO -- Gov. Gavin Newsom's anti-Trump, anti-Texas congressional redistricting gamble seems about to pay off.\n\nNewsom's bet on Proposition 50 is looking like a winner, although we won't really know until the vote count is released starting election night Nov. 4.\n\nInsiders closely watching the high-stakes campaign would be shocked if Republicans pulled an upset and defeated the Democrats' retaliatory response to red state gerrymandering.\n\nThey talk mostly about the expected size of victory, not whether it will win. The hedged consensus is that it'll be by a modest margin, not a blowout.\n\nAny size victory would help Newsom promote himself nationally as the Democrat whom party activists anxiously seek to aggressively fight Trumpism. It could energize grassroots progressives to back the Californian in early 2028 presidential primaries.\n\nPropositions 50's defeat, however, could be a devastating blow to Newsom's presidential aspirations. If Californians wouldn't follow him, why should other people?\n\nPrivate and independent polls have shown Proposition 50 being supported by a small majority of registered voters. Not enough for an early victory dance. But the opposition is nowhere close to a majority. A lot of people have been undecided. They may not even bother to vote in a special election with only one state measure on the ballot.\n\nAs of last week, the return of mail-in ballots was running about the same as in last year's presidential election at the same point -- very unusual.\n\nA slightly higher percentage of Democrats were casting ballots than GOP registrants. This is particularly significant in a state where 45% of voters are Democrats and only 25% are Republicans. The GOP needs a humungous turnout to beat Democrats on almost anything.\n\nYou can credit President Trump's antics for riling up Democrats to vote early.\n\nOne practical importance of early Democratic voting is that the \"yes\" side doesn't need to spend more money appealing to people who have already mailed in their ballots.\n\n\"It's a bird in the hand kind of thing,\" says Paul Mitchell, the Democrats' chief data processor and principal drawer of the gerrymandered congressional maps up for approval in Proposition 50.\n\nMitchell believes the large recent weekend turnouts in California of \"No Kings\" protesters are indicative of the anti-Trump outrage that is generating Democratic enthusiasm for Proposition 50.\n\nRepublican consultant Rob Stutzman thinks that Proposition 50 could have been beaten with enough money. But not nearly enough showed up. Potential donors probably concluded it was a lost cause, he says. Don't waste the cash.\n\nIt takes ridiculous amounts of money to win a competitive statewide race in California, with 23 million diverse voters scattered over hundreds of miles and several costly media markets.\n\nDemocrats, with their unmatched California power, have raised well over $100 million from unions, billionaire Democratic donors and other political investors.\n\nBillionaire hedge-fund founder Tom Steyer put up $12 million. There are rumors he's tempted to run for governor.\n\nLos Angeles developer Rick Caruso is thinking very seriously about entering the 2026 gubernatorial race. He just paid for 100,000 pro-50 mail pieces in L.A. County, aimed at those least likely to vote.\n\nOne problem for the opposition is that it never unified behind a main anti-50 message. It ranged from \"reject Newsom's power grab\" to \"win one for Trump\" and a purist lecture about retaining California's current congressional districts drawn by a voter-created good government citizens' commission.\n\nThe basic pro-50 message is simply, as Steyer says in his TV ad: \"Stick it to Trump.\"\n\nThis contest at its core is about which party controls Congress after next year's midterm elections -- or whether Republicans and Democrats at least share power. It's about whether there'll be a Congress with some gumption to confront a power-mad, egotistical president.\n\nThe fight started when Trump banged on Texas to redraw -- gerrymander -- its congressional districts to potentially gain five more Republican seats in the House of Representatives. Democrats need only a slight pickup to capture House control -- and in an off-year election, the non-presidential party tends to acquire many.\n\nTexas obediently obliged the nervous Trump, and other red states also have.\n\nNewsom responded by urging the California Legislature to redraw this state's maps to potentially gain five Democratic seats, neutralizing Texas' underhanded move. The lawmakers quickly did. But in California, voter approval is needed to temporarily shelve the independent commission's work. That's what Proposition 50 does.\n\nIt also would boost Newsom's standing among party activists across America.\n\n\"He's been trying to claim the national leadership on anti-Trump. This is a chance for him to show he can deliver,\" says UC Berkeley political scientist Eric Schickler. \"There's a sense the party doesn't know how to fight back.\n\n\"On the flip side, if he were unable to persuade California voters to go along with him, it would be a hard sell to show Democrats nationally he's the best person to take on Republicans.\"\n\n\"It's a gamble,\" says UC San Diego political science professor Thad Kousser. \"If 50 wins, he's a person who can effectively fight back against Donald Trump. If it loses, he has no hope of winning on the national level.\"\n\nBut veteran political consultant Mike Murphy -- a former Republican who switched to independent -- thinks Newsom could survive voters' rejection of Proposition 50.\n\n\"It would take some of the shine off him. But he'd still be a contender. It wouldn't knock him out. The worst you could say was that he lost 50 but was fighting the good fight.\n\n\"If 50 wins, Gavin might have a good future as a riverboat gambler if he puts all the chips in.\"",

    "body": "Republican officials in California are expressing dismay with President Donald Trump for staying out of the fight with Gov. Gavin Newsom over an effort to redistrict the state that could cost Republicans multiple seats in the House.\n\nAccording to a report from Politico, California Republicans are choosing their words carefully when complaining about the president turning his back on their efforts to derail Proposition 50, with Politico's Alex Gangitano writing \"the White House has been backing away from campaigning against Democrats' efforts to redraw California's House map, appearing largely resigned to the idea it will pass given Democrats' strong polling advantage.\"\n\nAccording to KTLA last week, \"A new Emerson College poll found that 57 percent of likely California voters support Prop 50, which authorizes temporary changes to the state congressional maps, while 37 percent oppose it.\"\n\nThe report notes the state's GOP leaders have good reason to be frustrated after \"Trump, who rarely shies away from a fight with one of his chief foils in Newsom, vowed in August to file lawsuits against California over the redistricting measure. He hasn't followed through with that promise.\"\n\nAccording to a White House insider, \"The president's never going to shy away from a fight with California, we all know that. Do I think there are other fights like immigration, like tamping down on the crime? On the totem pole of the fight with Gavin Newsom, I don't think the gerrymander fight is top three.\"\n\nFormer Rep. Mimi Walters (R-CA) claimed the issue is bigger than just California. \"I think what the Republicans are trying to do is make this a local issue. What the Democrats are trying to do is make this a national issue,\" she explained. \"Unfortunately for Republicans, there's not as many Republicans as there are Democrats in our state and the Democrats have the money behind them on Prop 50.\"\n\nA Californian with close ties to the state's GOP leadership agreed, telling Politico, \"I assume Kevin McCarthy and President Trump are aligned, but the White House's lack of engagement at this point is an indication that the 'No' campaign is struggling.\"\n\nThat individual lamented that Trump may have given up too early\n\n\"Two weeks ago, if President Trump had been more active, and excited the 20 percent of solid MAGA voters in California, it may have made a difference in this low turnout election,\" that source suggested.",

    "body": "California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) hinted Sunday that he will run for president in 2028, making a formal announcement after the 2026 midterm elections.\n\nCBS News reported Sunday:\n\nIn an interview taped Thursday in San Jose, Newsom was asked whether he would give \"serious thought\" to a White House bid once next year's midterm elections are over.\n\n\"Yeah, I'd be lying otherwise,\" Newsom replied. \"I'd just be lying. And I'm not -- I can't do that.\"\n\nNewsom, whose term ends in January 2027 and is prevented from running again due to term limits, cautioned that any decision is years away.\n\nNewsom's posture toward the Trump administration, in which he has sacrificed potentially $40 billion in ire relief for the sake of trolling President Donald Trump on social media and suing to stop his administration's policies, can only be explained by his presidential ambitions and his desire to show Democratic Party primary voters that he can fight.\n\nHe took the opposite approach in 2020, during the coronavirus pandemic, when he was at great pains to show how well he was working with the Trump administration, in the hope of gaining more assistance.\n\nNewsom and rivals like Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker are engaged in a \"race to the bottom,\" both in terms of rhetoric and governing performance, gambling on the idea that Democratic Party primary voters will prefer a candidate who fights over a candidate who can show a record of positive achievements in public life.\n\nThe California governor, despite facing massive state budget deficits for two consecutive years, has managed to find $50 million for legal attacks on the Trump administration; $140 to bail out Planned Parenthood; and $251 million for a special election to gerrymander California's congressional districts to help Democrats.\n\nNewsom has little to show for seven years at the helm of California government. His state leads the nation in unemployment and in poverty, despite having a wealthy tax base in coastal areas (some burned by wildfires).",

    "title": "White House targets voting. But Trump is sitting out California's redistricting war.",
    "body": "But aside from the monitoring, the White House has been backing away from campaigning against Democrats' efforts to redraw California's House map, appearing largely resigned to the idea it will pass given Democrats' strong polling advantage. President Donald Trump still thinks he has the upper hand on Gavin Newsom on more salient issues, allies told POLITICO.\n\nTrump, who rarely shies away from a fight with one of his chief foils in Newsom, vowed in August to file lawsuits against California over the redistricting measure. He hasn't followed through with that promise.\n\nAnd since then, he has been mum on the issue, convinced crime and illegal immigration in California are more durable political cudgels for him in the long run as state Democrats' redistricting campaign increasingly appears to be a losing battle for Republicans in November.\n\n\"The president's never going to shy away from a fight with California, we all know that. Do I think there are other fights like immigration, like tamping down on the crime? On the totem pole of the fight with Gavin Newsom, I don't think the gerrymander fight is top three,\" said a person familiar with strategy inside the White House, who was granted anonymity to relay the latest thinking.\n\nAgainst the backdrop of the redistricting battle, which began in California after national and state Republicans started the gerrymandering arms race in Texas -- Trump flirted with the idea of sending the National Guard into San Francisco. He stood down after speaking with Daniel Lurie, the city's Democratic mayor, and after personal friends and tech sector leaders advised him not to go through with the surge. Trump suggested he will give Lurie \"a chance to see if he can turn it around\" without federal government intervention, putting an anti-Trump blue city to the test.\n\nWhile Trump's wider offensive on the twin issues of crime and immigration continues apace elsewhere, he's largely been silent on California's gerrymander, and Newsom's elevated role in leading the charge against the White House.\n\nMeanwhile, other Republicans with ties to the Golden State have been speaking out, while the party writ large -- led by former House speaker Kevin McCarthy, lags far behind Newsom in fundraising.\n\n\"I think what the Republicans are trying to do is make this a local issue,\" said former Rep. Mimi Walters (R-Calif.). \"What the Democrats are trying to do is make this a national issue.\"\n\nShe said, \"Unfortunately for Republicans, there's not as many Republicans as there are Democrats in our state and the Democrats have the money behind them on Prop 50.\"\n\nThe calculus appears to be working for Democrats. Among California voters supporting the measure, 75 percent said they are voting \"yes\" to oppose Trump, according to a recent CBS News poll, while only 41 percent said they will vote for it to support Newsom. The measure is leading in that poll and others.\n\nAnd while some Republicans in California would welcome his involvement, there would be little political upside for Trump in associating himself ahead of the midterms with a losing campaign.\n\n\"I assume Kevin McCarthy and President Trump are aligned, but the White House's lack of engagement at this point is an indication that the 'No' campaign is struggling,\" said a person close to the thinking of the California GOP. \"Two weeks ago, if President Trump had been more active, and excited the 20 percent of solid MAGA voters in California, it may have made a difference in this low turnout election.\"\n\nWhen asked about Trump not actively pushing against Prop 50, Hannah Milgrom, Yes on 50 spokesperson, replied: \"Donald Trump is weak and knows that we are going to expose him for what he truly is -- a loser.\"\n\nAttorney general Pam Bondi announced on Friday the DOJ will monitor polling sites on November 4 as a way to uphold \"the highest standards of election integrity.\"\n\n\"We will commit the resources necessary to ensure the American people get the fair, free, and transparent elections they deserve,\" she said.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, has not commented on the election monitoring while he is traveling in Asia. Newsom, though, said the Trump administration has \"no business screwing around with next month's election.\"\n\nRather than fight against the Democrats' map in California, which Trump lost in 2024 to Kamala Harris by more than 20 percentage points, Trump advisers are relying on redistricting in redder states to tilt the map.\n\n\"I think the best backboard that we have, even if this does pass, we're going to get Florida, we're going to get Texas, North Carolina,\" the person familiar with strategy inside the White House.\n\nAnother person close to Trump's orbit argued that the president knows he \"still does not play well in blue, blue states like California,\" adding that there's also confidence in Republicans' chances of winning the larger gerrymander fight.\n\nRepublicans in Texas and North Carolina are moving ahead to gerrymander and pick up GOP seats. Under pressure from Trump, Republicans in Indiana tried to pass mid-cycle redistricting but appear to not have enough votes to pass it. The California measure was Democrats' response to the Texas redistricting plan that Gov. Greg Abbott signed in August.\n\n\"Certainly it's a very national, politicized special election. And I think one of the key elements is, this is really sort of an early referendum on the Trump administration,\" said Blake Zante, executive director of the California nonpartisan public policy group The Maddy Institute.\"They are gerrymandering seats in California in response to Texas's mid-decade redistricting. So, I think people are very aware of the motives behind it. And I think there's also really no secret that Governor Newsom has national ambitions as well, and so that's certainly always kind of lying in the background.\"",

    "title": "Transportation secretary says he will pull $160M from California over noncitizen truck licenses",
    "body": "U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy warned Sunday that he is about make good on a threat to revoke millions in federal funds for California because he says the state is illegally issuing commercial driver's licenses to noncitizens.\n\nIn an appearance on Fox News Channel's \"Sunday Morning Futures,\" Duffy said Gov. Gavin Newsom has refused to comply with Department of Transportation rules that require the state to stop issuing such licenses and review those already issued.\n\n\"So, one, I'm about to pull $160 million from California,\" Duffy said. \"And, as we pull more money, we also have the option of pulling California's ability to issue commercial driver's licenses.\"\n\nEva Spiegel, a spokesperson for the California Department of Motor Vehicles, said the Trump administration \"has no legitimate basis\" to withhold federal highway transportation funds.\n\n\"The federal government previously allowed commercial driver's licenses for asylum seekers and refugees and on September 26 announced emergency regulations to cease this practice that went into effect on September 29. California is in compliance with these regulations and will remain in compliance with federal law,\" Spiegel said via email.\n\nWhen Duffy threatened to revoke funds last month, a spokesperson for Newsom dismissed the attack and noted that CDL holders from California have a significantly lower rate of crashes than both the national average and that of Texas, which is the only state with more licensed commercial drivers.\n\nLast month the Transportation Department tightened commercial driver's license requirements for noncitizens after three fatal crashes that officials said were caused by immigrant truck drivers. Only three specific classes of visa holders will be eligible for CDLs under the new rules and states must verify an applicant's immigration status in a federal database. The licenses will be valid for up to one year unless the applicant's visa expires sooner.\n\nDuffy said last month that California should never have issued 25% of 145 licenses investigators reviewed. He cited four California licenses that remained valid after the driver's work permit expired -- sometimes years after. The state had 30 days to come up with a plan to comply or lose funding.\n\nA nationwide commercial driver's license audit began after officials say a driver in the country illegally made a U-turn and caused a crash in Florida that killed three people. It found licenses that were issued improperly in California, Colorado, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Texas and Washington.\n\nDuffy said Sunday that California has unlawfully issued tens of thousands of these licenses to noncitizens.\n\n\"So you have 60,000 people on the roads who shouldn't have licenses,\" Duffy said. \"They're driving fuel tankers, they're driving school buses, and we have seen some of the crashes on American roadways that come from these people who shouldn't have these licenses.\"\n\nDuffy said earlier this month that he would withhold $40 million from California because it is the only state that is failing to enforce English language requirements for truckers. California defended its practices in a formal response to the Transportation Department, but federal officials were not satisfied.\n\nThe investigation launched after the Florida crash found what Duffy called significant failures in the way California is enforcing rules that took effect in June after one of President Donald Trump's executive orders. California had issued the driver a commercial license, but these English rules predate the crash.",

    "body": "California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a leading Democratic critic of President Donald Trump, says he will consider running for the White House in 2028 after the midterm elections next year.\n\nAsked in an interview with \"CBS Sunday Morning\" whether if would be fair to say he would give a campaign serious thought after the November 2026 vote, the term-limited governor said, \"I'd be lying otherwise.\"\n\nNewsom has been trying to raise his national profile, adopting a combative style that parodies Trump's social media strategy with similar all-caps posts, memes and merchandise.\n\nThe Democratic governor has sparred with the Republican president over the deployment of the California National Guard following immigration protests and Trump's redistricting moves in Texas. Newsom has also led a campaign to redraw California's own maps to add five Democratic U.S. House seats in response to the changes in Texas. Voting is underway on the so-called Proposition 50 and concludes Nov. 4.\n\n\"I'm looking forward to who presents themselves in 2028 and who meets that moment. And that's the question for the American people,\" he said in the interview that aired Sunday.\n\nThe feud between Trump and Newsom does not seem like it's going away anytime soon. On Thursday, Trump acknowledged he had agreed to halt a planned show of federal force planned for this weekend in San Francisco after appeals from tech executives and the mayor. Newsom was mayor of San Francisco between 2004 and 2011.\n\nIn the interview, Newsom described Trump as an \"invasive species.\"\n\n\"He's a wrecking ball. Not just the symbolism and substance of the East Wing,\" Newsom said, referring to the demolition of that part of the White House to build a ballroom. \"He's wrecking alliances, truth, trust, tradition, institutions.\"\n\nEarlier this year, Newsom launched a podcast in an effort to brand himself as a centrist. During the show, he has held conversations with influential figures all across the political spectrum, from late conservative Charlie Kirk, who was assassinated on a college campus tour, as well as former Trump strategist Steve Bannon, to Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, who was former Vice President Kamala Harris' 2024 running mate, and U.S. Rep. Jasmine Crockett, a Texas Democrat.",

Gavin Newsom's argument that the proposed redistricting in the state was temporary, calling the notion \"total fantasy.\"\n\n\"I think when he -- when they say this is temporary, there is no such thing. I mean, the longest programs are government programs that are temporary. Okay, just remember that if this is a tax program or if it is the redistricting program, anything that is temporary with government is permanent,\" he told CNN's Jake Tapper on \"State of the Union,\" responding to a clip of Newsom touting his Proposition 50 legislation that would reshape congressional seats.\n\nVoting opened last week to add as many as five Democrat-held seats in Congress, which could possibly offset President Donald Trump's moves in Texas and elsewhere to help Republicans in the 2026 election. Obama endorsed Prop 50 this week.\n\n\"In the year 2032 when the independent redistricting commission is supposed to come back, they're going to say, 'Wait a minute. There's still gerrymandering going on in Texas. There's still gerrymandering going on in Ohio. There's still gerrymandering going on in Florida. We have to continue with gerrymandering.' This is what's going to happen. They will find an excuse. So therefore I don't think it is temporary. So that's total fantasy,\" Schwarzenegger said.\n\nNewsom issued a response to those who oppose Proposition 50 and said, \"Spare me the moral high ground.\"\n\nSchwarzenegger called the redistricting efforts cheating, and said Democrats needed to outperform Trump.\n\n\"What the Democrats should do is they should outperform Trump. To me, it's all about competition creates performance. And so what they do is with the redistricting commission is that they're going to go and try to draw the district lines in such a way that they get voted in, no matter if they work well or not for the American people. So the American people get cheated on this whole thing. That is really the problem here,\" he said.\n\nThe former Republican California governor said that he understood Republicans and Democrats needed to \"fight\" about it, but argued that Americans were being cheated.\n\n\"I think that if you want to really fight for democracy, why would you go in, destroy the Constitution in California, tear it up and redo it, do the whole thing? So to me, it just doesn't make any sense at all,\" he added.\n\nSchwarzenegger has come out against the redistricting efforts in a post on social media, where he posted a photo of himself at the gym wearing a t-shirt that read \"terminate gerrymandering.\"\n\nThe former governor also told CNN that he and Newsom were friendly and spoke about the issue. Schwarzenegger said they've been speaking out about it without attacking one another.",

That would give the party control over the federal budget and give them the ability to impeach Trump for acts he takes while in office.\n\nHowever, there may be a dark-horse waiting in the wings to undercut Democrats' chances of retaking the White House in 2028, Newsom warned.\n\n\"Finally, you have rebalanced the system, coequal branch of government begins to assert itself, it appears again,\" Newsom told CNN. \"If you have a Speaker [Mike] Johnson (R-LA), we may have a third term of President Trump, I really believe that.\"\n\nTrump has consistently talked about running for a third term, something that is expressly prohibited by the 22nd Amendment to the Constitution. While some Republicans have rebuffed the chatter, Johnson has not weighed in on Trump's plans.\n\nTrump ally Steve Bannon has said there is a plan to install Trump as president in 2028.",

    "body": "California Gov. Gavin Newsom's characterizations of his humble origins are raising eyebrows, given his family's ties to the late billionaire heir Gordon Getty.\n\nDuring a recent appearance on the \"All The Smoke\" podcast, Newsom (D) recounted how his mother, who divorced from his father when he was young, hustled when he was growing up.\n\n\"My mom was 19, pregnant and divorced a few years later, with two kids,\" he said on the podcast. \"Came from no money and just hustled. You know, worked hard, grinding every single day. Two and a half jobs, no bulls -- .\"\n\n\"We had roommates all the time because she couldn't afford the rent,\" he continued. \"...It was also about paying the bills, man. It was just like hustling and and so I was out there, kind of raising myself, turning on the TV, just getting obsessed. I was sitting there with the Wonder Bread...the macaroni and cheese.\"\n\nThroughout his career, Newsom has told similar hardscrabble stories implying that he grew up in poverty or in the lower echelons of the middle class, seeking to be more relatable to voters.\n\nOver the summer, for example, he claimed to have slept on the couch and that his sister slept in a hallway because his mother had to rent out the spare bedroom.\n\nBut skeptics have pointed out that Newsom's late father, William, a former associate justice on the California Court of Appeals, served as a hifalutin attorney for Getty's billion-dollar fortune.\n\nWilliam was so involved with the Gettys that he helped deliver the ransom payment in response to the kidnapping of John Paul Getty III.\n\nThe elder Newsom previously explained that he was limited in helping out Gavin's mother financially due to his costly run for the Senate in 1968.\n\n\"I made a foolish mistake of putting my own money in it and losing,\" he said, according to a 2003 San Francisco Chronicle article.\n\n\"I had a huge deficit when it was over. I lost my law practice in the process. Things were unraveling. It took me quite a while to pull myself out financially. Tessa was working a number of jobs. Gavin had jobs after school.\"\n\nHe later added, \"I was around people of wealth, but I never had any money, nor did Gavin.\"\n\nYet, after Gavin graduated from Santa Clara University, he started up a boutique winery, PlumpJack Group, with Getty's financial backing.\n\n\"Anyone with more than an inch of curiosity would know that Governor Newsom was raised by his mother after her divorce from his father when he was 3 years old,\" a Newsom spokesperson told The Post.\n\n\"He has talked about moving between two different worlds, but he was raised by a mother who worked three jobs at one point -- secretary, waitress, and paralegal.\"\n\nNotably, Newsom attended kindergarten and first grade at École Notre Dame des Victoires, a Catholic school.\n\nIn August, Newsom trolled Vice President JD Vance, showing off a stylish photo purportedly of him in high school wearing a fancy scarf juxtaposed with a throwback pic of the VP in high school wearing a bland t-shirt standing next to women posed in front of urinals.",

    "body": "Just 10 months into President Donald Trump's second term, key Democrats are already starting to look ahead to the race to replace him in 2028.\n\nFormer Vice President Kamala Harris, whom Trump defeated in 2024, told the BBC on Saturday that she was \"not done\" with elected office and the first female president could \"possibly\" be her.\n\n\"I am not done,\" she said. \"I have lived my entire career as a life of service and it's in my bones.\"\n\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom, who has been among the most active opponents of Trump's policies, told CBS News \"Sunday Morning\" that he will make his decision on running after the 2026 midterm elections.\n\n\"Yeah, I'd be lying otherwise,\" Newsom said. \"I'd just be lying. And I'm not -- I can't do that.\"\n\nNewsom has taken to needling Trump frequently on social media, mocking his all-caps, exclamation-mark heavy style, as well as taking more serious actions like suing him to stop his deployment of the National Guard to California cities or sending them to other states.\n\n\"I'm looking forward to who presents themselves in 2028 and who meets that moment. And that's the question for the American people,\" he said in the interview that aired Sunday.\n\nDemocrats have been trying to find a path out of the political wilderness after President Joe Biden waited until July 2024 to abandon his reelection campaign and anoint Harris as his successor. With little more than three months to build a campaign against Trump, she still won 226 Electoral College votes to Trump's 312. A candidate needs 270 Electoral College votes to take the White House.\n\nThe party, while complaining bitterly about Trump's immigration, tariff and military policies, has yet to enunciate a clear vision of how they would govern if they won back control of the White House and Congress. Democrats lost ground with the Black and Hispanic voters they long took for granted, although polls show Trump is now losing some of the support he won from those voting blocs in 2024.\n\nBesides Harris and Newsom, other potential candidates include Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear and Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro.\n\nVice President JD Vance is widely expected to seek the Republican nomination. The Constitution bars Trump from seeking another term.",

Tim Walz, who was former Vice President Kamala Harris' 2024 running mate, and U.S. Rep. Jasmine Crockett, a Texas Democrat.",

    "body": "\"I'm looking forward to who presents themselves in 2028 and who meets that moment,\" California's governor tells CBS Sunday Morning\n\nGavin Newsom is closer than ever to running for president in 2028. In an interview with CBS Sunday Morning, California's Governor admitted he'll strongly examine whether or not he will run for president in 2028 after 2026 midterms.\n\n\"I'd be lying [if I said] otherwise. I'd just be lying and I can't do that,\" Newsom explained. \"I'm looking forward to who presents themselves in 2028 and who meets that moment. And that's the question for the American people.\"\n\nElsewhere in the interview, Newsom admitted he has grave concerns about the possibility Donald Trump could attempt to seek a 3rd term -- which is prohibited by the 22nd Amendment. Newsom also has ideas about what Democrats can do to thwart the president, who he described as \"an invasive species.\"\n\nNewsom first attacked the Trump administration's attempts at redistricting - and then explained what could be described as his own attempt to do something similar. Californian voters will weigh in on Proposition 50, which would redraw congressional district lines in favor of the Democrats.\n\n\"On one level, Proposition 50 is about congressional maps, but you're framing it as something bigger. I think it's about our democracy. It's about the future of this republic. I think it's about what the founding fathers lived and died for,\" he said.\n\nNewsom also said that this year's elections could help Democrats \"take back the House\" and thus thwart some of the Trump administration's plans.\n\n\"If you have a Speaker Johnson, we may have a third term of President Trump. I really believe that. We do not want one of Trump's leading antagonists at a time when the President is wielding executive power across the board and facing little pushback from Republicans in Congress,\" he explained. \"We do not want our streets militarized by our own armed forces, not in LA, not in California, not anywhere.\"\n\nWhen asked what it's like leading the state of California with Trump in D.C., Newsom bluntly answered, \"Yeah, I mean, it's a hell of a way to govern.\"\n\n\"We're just governing in just profound uncertainty. This is tectonic plates that we're familiar with out here on the West Coast, but of the nature of our politics,\" he explained. \"Some may find this, you know, may not be a sort of prudent thing to say about the President of the United States, but I mean, he's an invasive species ... for the country, for the world, he's a wrecking ball, not just the symbolism and substance of the East Wing. He's wrecking alliances, truth, trust, tradition, institutions.\"\n\nWatch the interview with Gavin Newsom in the video above.",

    "body": "The Democratic governor decried Trump for causing \"terror on the streets of America.\"\n\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom (D) is condemning President Donald Trump for \"disappearing [people] on the basis of the color of their skin\" amid his violent, sweeping ICE raids.\n\nAppearing on \"All the Smoke\" podcast Saturday hosted by former NBA stars Matt Barnes and Stephen Jackson, Newsom was asked how the nation can \"recover\" from Trump's mass deportation agenda.\n\n\"We talk about authoritarianism, and people say, 'What do you feel here?' For guys like me, maybe not yet,\" Newsom said, speaking on the president's increase in immigration and deportation raids. \"But for the black and brown community, are you kidding me?\"\n\nThe Democratic governor went on to decry the way immigrants have been terrified to do everyday tasks like walking their dogs, going to the clinic or attending family members' funerals as they fear being targeted by ICE.\n\n\"It's not just on the basis of the skin, it's where you congregate. It's the language you speak or your accent. In the United States in 2025, people [are] disappearing [with] no due process rights,\" he continued.\n\nNewsom noted that \"masked\" ICE agents are \"literally jumping out the back of U-haul [trucks]\" without identifying themselves to capture \"Americans, tourists [and] some people [who are] here with documentation, some without.\"\n\nElsewhere in the interview, Newsom opened up about meeting a teenager who grew up in Ventura County, California, who he said was frightened to speak to him following his parents' disappearance after an ICE attack. The politician said ICE \"smashed [their car] window\" and arrested them on their way to work at a \"packing facility.\"\n\n\"That's America in 2025 -- Donald Trump. Terror on the streets of America,\" he added. \"Taking black hawk helicopters and getting people to rappel [into people's homes] and sitting there as kids are in their diapers, in their cribs.\"\n\nNewsom further slammed ICE for attacking people \"who are naked and sleeping, and literally putting guns to their heads and zip-tying them\" before brutally \"throwing them out onto the streets and sidewalks.\"\n\nStressing that this is \"happening in America right now today,\" Newsom continued, \"So this is serious, and it's happened in [Los Angeles] -- first city that was terrorized [by Trump's deployment of National Guard troops and ICE agents] ... [It] continues to this day.\"\n\nHe added, \"Now you got it in Portland, and you got it in places like Illinois. They threatened San Francisco yesterday.\"\n\nNewsom's remarks came after he vowed last week to sue the Trump administration in a \"nanosecond\" if the White House advanced its plan to deploy the National Guard to San Francisco.\n\nNewsom argued that Trump and White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller's reported plans to send more than 100 federal immigration agents to the San Francisco Bay Area is a part of the pair's \"authoritarian playbook,\" alleging that \"they're looking\" to \"invoke chaos.\"\n\nTrump and Newsom have repeatedly publicly clashed as the latter has frequently criticized the president over his blanketed targeting of immigrants.\n\nThe political figure, who condemned the use of masked federal agents, particularly during raids in Los Angeles, signed a bill last month banning law enforcement officials from wearing masks, which he told Barnes and Jackson he was \"proud\" to do so.",

Gavin Newsom (D) addressed if he's actually weighing the idea of a future in the White House during an interview on this weekend's episode of \"CBS Sunday Morning.\"\n\nAfter rolling a clip of the governor glad-handing with people in the Republican-heavy state of South Carolina, Robert Costa asked him if he plans to put \"serious thought\" into the possibility of a 2028 presidential run after the next cycle of midterm elections.\n\n\"Yeah, I'd be lying otherwise. I'd just be lying. And I'm not -- I can't do that,\" Newsom admitted, also adding that he still has several years before he'd have to officially commit to a campaign.\n\n\"Fate will determine that,\" he said.\n\nThe governor is set to leave Sacramento in January 2027, with California term limits taking the option of another state-wide run off the table.\n\nAlready a big name in Democratic politics, Newsom's profile has only risen since he's positioned himself as one of President Donald Trump's loudest critics during his second term.\n\nInstead of scolding or hand-wringing, he's most often relied on trolling aka mocking Trump's boisterous social media style and dropping merch that dupes the president's signature MAGA aesthetic.\n\nThat doesn't mean Newsom's ignoring the nuts and bolts of electoral politics though. In an effort to offset gerrymandering efforts in red states like Texas, he helped put a blue-slanted redistricting plan on California ballots in a special election this year.\n\nDespite robust name recognition and a respectable political resume, the governor told Costa the idea of a presidential run still seemed like a mind-boggling possibility for someone who once strained to get through school.\n\n\"I have no idea. The idea that a guy who got 960 on his SAT, that still struggles to read scripts, that was always in the back of the classroom,\" Newsom said, referring to his dyslexia diagnosis. \"The idea that you would even throw that out is, in and of itself, extraordinary.\"\n\n\"Who the hell knows?\" he added. \"I'm looking forward to who presents themselves in 2028 and who meets that moment.

    "title": "Arnold Schwarzenegger dismisses Newsom argument that redistricting effort is temporary as 'total fantasy'",
    "body": "Former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger said Gov. Gavin Newsom's claim that his redistricting plan would be temporary \"total fantasy\" during a CNN interview.\n\nFormer California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger dismissed current Gov. Gavin Newsom's argument that the proposed redistricting in the state was temporary, calling the notion \"total fantasy.\"\n\n\"I think when he -- when they say this is temporary, there is no such thing. I mean, the longest programs are government programs that are temporary. Okay, just remember that if this is a tax program or if it is the redistricting program, anything that is temporary with government is permanent,\" he told CNN's Jake Tapper on \"State of the Union,\" responding to a clip of Newsom touting his Proposition 50 legislation that would reshape congressional seats.\n\nVoting opened last week to add as many as five Democrat-held seats in Congress, which could possibly offset President Donald Trump's moves in Texas and elsewhere to help Republicans in the 2026 election. Obama endorsed Prop 50 this week.\n\n\"In the year 2032 when the independent redistricting commission is supposed to come back, they're going to say, 'Wait a minute. There's still gerrymandering going on in Texas. There's still gerrymandering going on in Ohio. There's still gerrymandering going on in Florida. We have to continue with gerrymandering.' This is what's going to happen. They will find an excuse. So therefore I don't think it is temporary. So that's total fantasy,\" Schwarzenegger said.\n\nREDISTRICTING BATTLE: NEWSOM VOWS TO FIGHT 'FIRE WITH FIRE'\n\nNewsom issued a response to those who oppose Proposition 50 and said, \"Spare me the moral high ground.\"\n\nSchwarzenegger called the redistricting efforts cheating, and said Democrats needed to outperform Trump.\n\n\"What the Democrats should do is they should outperform Trump. To me, it's all about competition creates performance. And so what they do is with the redistricting commission is that they're going to go and try to draw the district lines in such a way that they get voted in, no matter if they work well or not for the American people. So the American people get cheated on this whole thing. That is really the problem here,\" he said.\n\nABBOTT, TEXAS REPUBLICANS MAKE NEW PUSH FOR TRUMP-BACKED REDISTRICTING AS FLEEING DEMOCRATS TO END WALKOUT\n\nThe former Republican California governor said that he understood Republicans and Democrats needed to \"fight\" about it, but argued that Americans were being cheated.\n\n\"I think that if you want to really fight for democracy, why would you go in, destroy the Constitution in California, tear it up and redo it, do the whole thing? So to me, it just doesn't make any sense at all,\" he added.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE\n\nSchwarzenegger has come out against the redistricting efforts in a post on social media, where he posted a photo of himself at the gym wearing a t-shirt that read \"terminate gerrymandering.\"\n\nThe former governor also told CNN that he and Newsom were friendly and spoke about the issue. Schwarzenegger said they've been speaking out about it without attacking one another.",

    "title": "Newsom, Harris both considering runs for president in 2028",
    "body": "This is read by an automated voice. Please report any issues or inconsistencies here.\n\nIn a sign of California's rising status as a major hub of Democratic politics, Gov. Gavin Newsom said Sunday he's considering a run for president in 2028 -- just a day after former U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris made the same pronouncement.\n\nNewsom, a Democrat who has won national prominence this year pitching himself a leader of the resistance to President Trump, admitted for the first time publicly that he is seriously weighing a 2028 presidential run.\n\nIn an interview with \"CBS News Sunday Morning,\" Newsom was asked whether he would give \"serious thought\" after the 2026 midterms to a White House bid.\n\n\"Yeah, I'd be lying otherwise,\" Newsom replied. \"I'd just be lying. And I'm not -- I can't do that.\"\n\nHarris said this weekend in an interview with the BBC that she expects a woman will be president in the coming year. \"Possibly,\" she said, it could be her.\n\n\"I am not done,\" she said. \"I have lived my entire career as a life of service and it's in my bones.\"\n\nIt's still more than three years until the November 2028 election, and entirely possible only one or neither of the two California politicians could throw their hat in the race.\n\nBut the early willingness of Newsom and Harris to publicly consider a White House bid shows that the Golden State is still a major hub of Democratic politics. It also sets up a potential 2028 political showdown between two of California's weightiest political figureheads.\n\nFor years, Newsom has denied presidential ambitions. But since Trump defeated Harris in the November 2024 election, the California governor has emerged as a vocal critic of the Trump administration's agenda.\n\nUnder Newsom's leadership, California has filed dozens of lawsuits against Trump -- most noticeably against the Trump administration' deployment of National Guard and Marines to Los Angeles. The governor has also become more aggressive on social media, taking to X to taunt and troll Trump.\n\nStill, Newsom, whose term ends in January 2027 and who cannot run again for governor because of term limits, cautioned that he is not rushing into a 2028 presidential campaign.\n\n\"I have no idea,\" Newsom said Sunday of whether he will actually decide to run.\n\nAfter Trump defeated Harris in November, Harris was viewed as a possible candidate for California governor. But in July she announced that, after \"serious thought\" she would not run for the top California office.\n\n\"For now, my leadership -- and public service -- will not be in elected office,\" Harris said in a statement. \"I look forward to getting back out and listening to the American people, helping elect Democrats across the nation who will fight fearlessly, and sharing more details in the months ahead about my own plans.\"\n\nNewsom's interest in the White House raises the stakes for passing Proposition 50, a California ballot measure he has pushed -- in response to a similar initiative in Texas -- that would allow state Democrats to temporarily change the boundaries of U.S. House maps so that they are more favorable to Democrats. California voters will vote on Prop 50 in a special election next week.\n\nNewsom has cast his effort as a response to Trump's push to redraw maps in Republican-controlled states to make them more favorable to the GOP.\n\n\"I think it's about our democracy,\" Newsom said in the CBS interview. \"It's about the future of this republic. I think it's about, you know, what the founding fathers lived and died for, this notion of the rule of law, and not the rule of Don.\"\n\nIf Newsom is successful and Proposition 50 passes, the move could potentially help future Democratic candidates for the White House.\n\nBut either way, both Newsom and Harris would face high hurdles in battleground states if they ran for president.\n\nJust being a Californian is a liability, some argue, at a time when Republicans depict the state as a bastion of woke ideas, high taxes and crime.\n\nWhile California boasts the world's fifth-largest economy and is home to the massive tech powerhouse of Silicon Valley and the cultural epicenter of Hollywood, it has struggled in recent years with high housing costs and massive income inequality. In September, a study found California tied with Louisiana for the nation's highest poverty rate.\n\nNewsom, 58, a former San Francisco mayor who was born to a wealthy and well-connected San Francisco family, suggested in the CBS interview that he had already surmounted significant obstacles. Early on, Newsom struggled in school and suffered from dyslexia.\n\n\"The idea that a guy who got 960 on his SAT, that still struggles to read scripts, that was always in the back of the classroom, the idea that you would even throw that out is, in and of itself, extraordinary,\" Newsom said. \"Who the hell knows? I'm looking forward to who presents themselves in 2028 and who meets that moment. And that's the question for the American people.\"\n\nHarris, 61, who served as a U.S. senator and California attorney general before she became vice president in 2020 and then the Democratic Party's nominee in the 2024 presidential election, received criticism last year after losing to Trump by more than 2.3 million votes, about 1.5% of the popular vote. Some Democrats accused her of being an elite, out of touch candidate who failed to connect with voters in battleground states who have struggled economically in recent years.\n\nBut speaking in Los Angeles last month as she promoted her new memoir, \"107 Days,\" Harris appeared to take little responsibility for her 2024 loss.\n\n\"I wrote the book for many reasons, but primarily to remind us how unprecedented that election was,\" Harris said.\n\n\"Think about it. A sitting president of the United States is running for reelection and three and a half months before the election decides not to run, and then a sitting vice president takes up the mantle to run against a former president of the United States who has been running for 10 years, with 107 days to go.\"\n\nNewsom has already raised eyebrows this year by traveling to critical battleground election states.\n\nIn July, Newsom traveled more than 2,000 miles to South Carolina, a state that traditionally hosts the South's first presidential primary. He said he was working to help the party win back the U.S. House of Representatives in 2026. But at the time there were a dozen competitive House districts in California. South Carolina, a staunchly conservative state, did not have a single competitive race.\n\nAfter Newsom spoke in South Carolina, Rep. James Clyburn, the highest-ranking Black member of Congress and renowned Democratic kingmaker who rescued former President Biden's 2020 campaign, told The Times that Newsom would be \"a hell of a candidate.\"\n\n\"He's demonstrated that over and over again,\" Clyburn said, stopping short of endorsing him. \"I feel good about his chances.\"\n\nBut other leading South Carolina Democrats voiced doubts that Newsom could win over working class and swing voters in battleground states.\n\nRichard Harpootlian, a South Carolina attorney, former state senator and former chairman of the state Democratic Party, called Newsom \"a handsome man with great hair.\"\n\n\"But the party is searching for a left-of-moderate candidate who can articulate blue-collar hopes and desires,\" Harpootlian told The Times.\n\n\"If he had a track record of solving huge problems like homelessness, or the social safety net, he'd be a more palatable candidate,\" he added. \"I just think he's going to have a tough time explaining why there's so many failures in California.\"",

Gavin Newsom of California, who has positioned himself as one of President Trump's most visible Democratic antagonists, said on Sunday he will consider running for president after the 2026 midterm elections.\n\nMr. Newsom, a Democrat, has long been considered a potential candidate for 2028 by many political observers. But on \"CBS News Sunday Morning,\" he addressed the issue more directly when he was asked whether he would give a presidential run serious thought after the midterms.\n\n\"Yeah,\" he said, adding that saying otherwise, \"I'd just be lying, and I can't do that.\" The interview was taped on Thursday in San Jose, according to CBS.\n\nMr. Newsom is currently serving in his second term as governor, which ends in January 2027, and is not eligible for re-election. He has acted as a foil to Trump administration policies and political maneuvering, pushing back against the presence of federal troops in Los Angeles, leading the effort to redraw the state's congressional maps to counter similar Republican efforts in Texas and even mocking the president's social media style.\n\nHis remarks on Sunday were not the first indication Mr. Newsom could run in 2028. In July, he met with Democratic voters in South Carolina, a pivotal primary state, which some saw as an early attempt to lay the groundwork for a run.\n\nIn the CBS interview, Mr. Newsom said he enjoyed that trip to South Carolina. \"I'm in the right business,\" he said. \"I love people.\"\n\nBut Mr. Newsom, who was one of President Joseph R. Biden's strongest allies on the 2024 campaign trail, made it clear that nothing was set in stone.\n\n\"I'm looking forward to who presents themselves in 2028 and who meets that moment,\" he said. \"That's the question for the American people.\"\n\nThe Democratic field for the next presidential race is still a long way from taking shape, but ambitious politicians with eyes on 2028 are beginning to make the kinds of trips that feel out, or potentially set up, official announcements.\n\nAnd at least two other party figures have acknowledged that they could be running in 2028.\n\nRahm Emanuel, the former Chicago mayor who served as the Biden administration's ambassador to Japan, is weighing a run.\n\nAnd former Vice President Kamala Harris suggested in an interview aired on Saturday that she was considering running again after falling short in 2024.\n\n\"I am not done,\" she told the BBC.",

Gavin Newsom, D-Calif., revealed on Sunday that he would start giving a possible 2028 run \"serious thought\" after the 2026 midterms during an interview with CBS.\n\n\"Is it fair to say, after the 2026 midterms, you're going to give it serious thought?\" CBS correspondent Robert Costa asked Newsom.\n\nThe California governor responded, \"Yeah, I'd be lying otherwise.\"\n\n\"I'd just be lying. And I can't do that,\" he added.\n\nNEWSOM WARNS AMERICANS 'YOU WILL LOSE YOUR COUNTRY' UNDER TRUMP AT CALIFORNIA SUMMIT\n\nCosta followed up and noted the governor has always said he would need a compelling reason to run for president.\n\n\"Are you moving closer to figuring out your own why and your own decision?\" Costa asked.\n\nNewsom responded by quoting Friedrich Nietzsche, \"if you have a compelling why, you can endure any how.\"\n\n\"I think the biggest challenge for anyone who runs for any office is people see right through you if you don't have that why. You're doing it for the wrong reasons.

Men are struggling. And multi-ethic, I mean, suicide rates are off the chart, dropout rates, suspension rates, loneliness, despair, deaths of despair. It's a serious crisis what's going on in this country. Democrats haven't focused on that issue.

    "title": "Highlights from Gavin Newsom's \"Sunday Morning\" interview: Proposition 50, opposing Trump, and 2028",
    "body": "In an exclusive interview with Robert Costa for \"CBS Sunday Morning,\" California Governor Gavin Newsom described the Democrats' redistricting in his state as an effort to ensure \"the future of this republic\" - and a necessary measure to counter President Trump's push to expand Republican gains in the U.S. House and secure its narrow majority.\n\nThe vote on Proposition 50 this November 4 was just one of the issues the Democrat discussed, including his own plans for the 2028 election.\n\nNewsom has been stumping across his state advocating for redistricting, in response to President Trump's redistricting push in Republican-controlled states, like Texas.\n\nRather than gerrymander districts in the state legislature, as Texas did, California is putting a ballot initiative, Proposition 50, before the voters on November 4 in order to allow for redistricting in next year's midterm election.\n\nIf Proposition 50 succeeds next week, Democrats will change the boundaries of U.S. House districts in California, making it easier for their party to win up to five more seats. (The state currently has 43 U.S. House seats held by Democrats, and 9 by Republicans.)\n\nNewsom is framing the effort as something about more than California's Congressional delegation, but about oversight of the Trump administration. \"I think it's about our democracy,\" he said. \"It's about the future of this republic. I think it's about, you know, what the founding fathers lived and died for, this notion of the rule of law, and not the rule of Don. This rule of popular sovereignty fundamentally, of co-equal branches of government, system of checks and balances.\n\nNewsom believes that if his party takes back control of the House and replaces Republican Speaker Mike Johnson with a Democrat, the Trump presidency will effectively be over. \"[Trump's] presidency de facto ends, if we are successful, we the people are successful, in taking back the House,\" he said. \"You'll have rebalanced the system. Co-equal branch of government begins to assert itself. It appears again.\"\n\nBut he fears what may happen if Democrats do not gain control in the House: \"If you have a Speaker Johnson, we may have a third-term of President Trump, I really believe that,\" a nod to Mr. Trump's public musing about seeking a third term despite the U.S. Constitution limiting presidents to two terms in office.\n\nNewsom has fought Mr. Trump's deployment of federal agents in California - from Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers in Los Angeles, to the threat of federalized National Guard troops in San Francisco and the Bay Area (which the president later pulled back). In fact, the state has filed 43 lawsuits against the Trump administration since Inauguration Day.\n\nCosta asked, \"What's it's like being the governor of the state of California, and not knowing, day-to-day, if the federal government's going to be sending agents or not to your state?\"\n\n\"It's a hell of a way to govern,\" Newsom replied. \"I mean, we're just governing just profound uncertainty, the sort of tectonic plates that we're familiar with out here on the West Coast, but on the nature of our politics. I've said this - may not be a sort of prudent thing to say about a President of the United States - but I mean, he's an invasive species.\"\n\n\"For California?\"\n\n\"For the country. For the world,\" Newsom said. \"He's a wrecking ball. Not just the symbolism and substance of the East Wing; he's wrecking alliances, truth, trust, tradition, institutions.\"\n\nHe also rejected suggestions that ICE agents are needed in California because of what the White House called \"third-world insurrection riots on American soil.\"\n\n\"California cooperates as it relates to criminals,\" he said. \"We continue to cooperate out of our state penitentiary system hundreds of people every month that we coordinate with ICE to go after the 'worst of the worst.' That's not what this is about, and everybody knows it. You don't just randomly show up at a car wash and tell me it's about the 'worst of the worst.' You don't randomly show up at the showrooms or the parking lots of every Home Depot.\"\n\nNewsom isn't just opposing Mr. Trump; he's also trying to understand the MAGA movement. His podcast, \"This Is Gavin Newsom,\" not only welcomes figures on his side of the political aisle, but also the president's allies, from Steve Bannon and Newt Gingrich to the late Charlie Kirk.\n\nNewsom said his own son has reminded him about paying attention to other voices. \"We've got a crisis in this country besides the crisis that we've discussed around the future of this republic,\" he said. \"We also have a crisis with masculinity and men. Men are struggling. ... I mean, suicide rates are off the chart, dropout rates, suspension rates, loneliness, despair, depths of despair. It's a serious crisis, what's going on in this country.\n\n\"Democrats haven't focused on that issue. And I'm very proud of the work, substantive work we're doing in this, but I've also been using the podcast to highlight that.\"\n\nThe governor also uses satire to tweak the president, aping Mr. Trump's prolific use of social media. Newsom's communications team regularly parodies President Trump's use of all-caps and AI-generated images, even signing off, \"THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS MATTER. -- GCN\"\n\nNewsom has said that his social-media posts are driven by both his desire to add a sense of humor to politics, and to challenge President Trump by using Trump-style tactics.\n\nThis past July, \"Sunday Morning\" spent a day following Newsom across South Carolina, a key state in the 2028 presidential race. Newsom worked the crowds, shaking hands and even pulling espresso shots at a coffee bar.\n\nNewsom's visit sparked interest among those at his events and in political circles that he might be mulling his own White House bid.\n\n\"I'm looking forward to who presents themselves in 2028 and who meets that moment. And that's the question for the American people. They'll make that determination,\" Newsom said in the interview this past week.\n\nCosta asked, \"Is it fair to say after the 2026 midterms, you're going to give it serious thought?\"\n\n\"Yeah. I'd be lying otherwise. I'd just be lying. And I'm - I can't do that.\"\n\nHe said it would be important for a candidate to impart to voters exactly why they are running. \"Nietzsche said, 'If you have a compelling why, you can endure any how.' And so, I think the biggest challenge for anyone who runs for any office is people see right through you if you don't have that why. You're doing it for the wrong reasons.\"\n\n\"When I saw you slinging shots behind the coffee bar, I thought, 'This guy might run for president.'\" Costa said.\n\nNewsom, who as a child was diagnosed with dyslexia, said, \"The idea that a guy who got 960 on his SAT, that still struggles to read scripts, that was always in the back of the classroom - the idea that you even throw that out is, in and of itself, extraordinary,\" he laughed. \"Who the hell knows?\"",

    "title": "Gavin Newsom for president? California governor says he's considering running",
    "body": "Governor Gavin Newsom said President Donald Trump sending federal troops to San Francisco is part of the \"authoritarian playbook.\"\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom said he will consider making a run for the White House after next year's midterm elections, following months of speculation the Democratic figure is preparing for a 2028 presidential bid.\n\nIn a taped interview with \"CBS News Sunday Morning\" that aired on Oct. 26, Newsom said he is giving \"serious thought\" to running for president.\n\n\"I'd be lying otherwise,\" Newsom said, when asked if he was considering it. \"I'd just be lying. And I'm not - I can't do that.\"\n\nIt's not the first time Newsom has signaled his interest in the nation's top political office - and he's been at the top of Democratic rosters for several years. Before former President Joe Biden ended his 2024 campaign and endorsed then-Vice President Kamala Harris, Newsom's name was often floated as a possible Democratic candidate if Biden decided not to seek another term.\n\nDespite the speculation, the governor was one of the Biden-Harris campaign's most vocal campaign surrogates, staunchly supporting Biden as the nominee and later, Harris. Newsom has drawn increased attention over the years for his willingness to go toe-to-toe with Republican politicians in debates and on social media.\n\nSince President Donald Trump began his second term in January, Newsom has stepped up his adversarial position against the Republican administration, once again fashioning himself as a leader of the Democratic resistance to the Trump administration.\n\nIt's a role he also played during the president's first term, and he has made waves in recent months for publicly sparring with the president and Vice President JD Vance in viral social media posts and videos.\n\nThe governor has also launched various legal challenges, including over the deployment of thousands of National Guard troops to Los Angeles in June. Newsom is backing a statewide ballot measure known as Prop. 50, a counter to Texas' redistricting efforts that would redraw the state's congressional districts through 2030 and create five more seats favorable to Democrats.\n\nLatest polls show the measure has significant support in the deep-blue Golden State.\n\nNewsom, 58, is a former mayor of San Francisco is currently in his second term as California's governor. He will term-out at the end of 2027.\n\nHe did not say in his interview with CBS, taped in San Jose, when exactly he expects to make his decision after the midterm elections.\n\n\"I'm looking forward to who presents themselves in 2028, and who meets that moment,\" Newsom said. \"And that's the question for the American people.\"\n\nNewsom's aired interview comes a day after Harris told the BBC she still isn't ruling out another presidential run, after choosing not to run to succeed Newsom as the next governor of California.\n\nKathryn Palmer is a politics reporter for USA TODAY.

    "title": "Gavin Newsom says he will consider White House run after 2026 elections",
    "body": "Robert Costa is a national correspondent for \"CBS News Sunday Morning\" and chief Washington analyst for CBS News.\n\nDemocratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who has become one of President Trump's most high-profile adversaries, told \"CBS News Sunday Morning\" in an exclusive interview that he will consider whether to run for president after the 2026 midterm elections.\n\nIn an interview taped Thursday in San Jose, Newsom was asked whether he would give \"serious thought\" to a White House bid once next year's midterm elections are over.\n\n\"Yeah, I'd be lying otherwise,\" Newsom replied. \"I'd just be lying. And I'm not -- I can't do that.\"\n\nNewsom, whose term ends in January 2027 and is prevented from running again due to term limits, cautioned that any decision is years away.\n\n\"Fate will determine that,\" he said, when asked about whether he is moving closer to working out a reason for a national candidacy.\n\nNewsom, 58, has made trips to key battleground states, including a visit this past July to South Carolina, which as of now is slated to host the first Democratic primary in the 2028 presidential election, although that could change.\n\nDuring that trip, which featured multiple stops and was covered by \"CBS News Sunday Morning,\" Newsom met with state Democratic leaders and stopped by a coffee shop to rally activists and help employees serve espresso drinks.\n\n\"I happen to, and thank God, I'm in the right business,\" Newsom said in the interview, when asked about his evident enjoyment in meeting Democrats in South Carolina. \"I love people. I actually love people.\"\n\nNewsom said talk of him possibly running for president, after facing challenges throughout his life, including dyslexia, is a reminder to him that lives can go in surprising directions.\n\n\"I have no idea,\" Newsom said of whether he will decide to run. \"The idea that a guy who got 960 on his SAT, that still struggles to read scripts, that was always in the back of the classroom, the idea that you would even throw that out is, in and of itself, extraordinary. Who the hell knows? I'm looking forward to who presents themselves in 2028 and who meets that moment. And that's the question for the American people.\"\n\nNewsom said his focus now is on passing Proposition 50, a California ballot measure he has championed that would allow state Democrats to temporarily change the boundaries of U.S. House districts and make them more favorable to the party. Newsom has cast his effort, which will be decided in a special election next week, as a response to Mr. Trump's push for Republican-controlled states, like Texas, to change their congressional maps so the GOP has a better chance at holding on to its narrow House majority next year.\n\n\"I think it's about our democracy. It's about the future of this republic. I think it's about, you know, what the Founding Fathers lived and died for, this notion of the rule of law, and not the rule of Don,\" Newsom said.\n\nTensions have run high ahead of the vote, with both parties seeing redistricting efforts as critical to achieving their goal of winning the U.S. House majority next year. Whichever party holds control of the House has subpoena and oversight powers over the Executive Branch.\n\n\"We've got hundreds and hundreds, ICE and Border Patrol,\" Newsom told Proposition 50 supporters on Thursday at a labor event, referring to federal agents in the state. Newsom predicted their presence might increase ahead of the Nov. 4 special election.\n\n\"Don't think for a second we're not going to be seeing more of that through Election Day,\" Newsom said. \"These guys are not screwing around.\"\n\nIn recent days, the Justice Department said it would send its own monitors to supervise the special election in California and the gubernatorial election in New Jersey. Newsom has denounced the move, calling it a Trump administration move to intimidate Democrats. The goal, according to the Justice Department, is \"to ensure transparency, ballot security, and compliance with federal law.\"\n\nWhile Newsom has long been a fixture in California, his foray into presidential politics generated intense interest last year when he was a fierce defender of President Joe Biden, especially in the wake of Biden's debate performance against Mr. Trump, which prompted many Democrats to call for Biden to exit the 2024 race.\n\nNewsom, however, never wavered on Biden's candidacy. In the days before Biden dropped out of the race, Newsom stumped for him nationwide, including in New Hampshire.\n\nSpeaking with \"CBS News Sunday Morning\" there in July 2024, about a week before Biden left the race, Newsom said he was \"all in\" on Biden.\n\n\"No daylight,\" Newsom said of his alliance with Biden at the time.\n\nAccording to sources close to both Newsom and Biden, the two men are close and have stayed in touch since Biden left the White House. Newsom is also friendly with former President Barack Obama, who has offered support for Proposition 50 and joined Newsom and volunteers on a video call last week.",

    "title": "We listened to all the podcasts from 2028 candidates. Here's who stood out.",
    "body": "California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) during a \"fireside chat\" in February in Los Angeles. (Ted Soqui/Sipa USA/AP)\n\nWhen California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) launched a podcast seven months ago, he was tapping into a broader trend. Politicians, who once saw podcasts as fringe or risky, now see them as an opportunity to connect with voters in a more casual setting and relish the chance to talk for hours at a time without a filter.\n\nNot all of the politician-hosted pods are must-listens -- unless you love awkward dad jokes, groveling interviews with donors and fellow elected officials, and a heavy dose of self-promotion. Many don't last long. Former presidential candidates Pete Buttigieg, Nikki Haley, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Vivek Ramaswamy are among those who abandoned their podcasts, as are countless members of Congress.\n\nIs anyone listening? It depends. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) draws the largest audience, with an average 1.8 million downloads and views per month. Others have far fewer listeners: A podcast co-hosted by Rep. Gil Cisneros (D-California) averages only 23, according to totals pulled by the podcast analytics firm Podscribe as of earlier this month.\n\nThat hasn't stopped people from trying. No fewer than six potential presidential candidates now host their own shows, with the majority launching just this year.\n\nAndy Beshear: The supportive dad with business guy friends\n\nKentucky Gov. Andy Beshear (D) frames his feel-good podcast -- launched in April -- as a way for listeners to process the onslaught of news. The show features friendly interviews with Democratic governors, members of Congress, influencers, celebrities, athletes and musicians, and one big donor -- often ending with rapid-fire softball questions like guests' favorite sports, foods, teams, playlist picks, fashion mistakes or secret super powers.\n\nThe SiriusXM podcast has a focus on listener self-care and comes with a list of rules -- to be authentic (\"You be you, boo\"), talk like a real human being, no debating reality, tell your why and have fun. For Beshear and his fellow middle-aged friends, that equates to a recurring segment where they learn such Gen Z slang as \"skibidi\" or \"clock it\" from Beshear's children or the show's intern. The results are as corny as you'd imagine.\n\n* Key quote: \"Make sure if you're overwhelmed you take a minute to breathe, reach out to your friends, process with them just like you do on this podcast. You're important, we care about you.\"\n\n* The Jo(h)ns: Beshear's first guest on the show was Democratic megadonor John Morgan, the billionaire founder of Morgan & Morgan, who announced this year that he is starting a new political party. He's not the only Morgan & Morgan affiliate to make an appearance: The podcast includes a regular segment where Beshear and two friends -- Morgan & Morgan attorney Jon Rabinowitz and insurance company owner John McConnell -- discuss the news of day.\n\n* The sponsors: Ads on the podcast include those for a website that shares information on ingredients in drinks, Andy Cohen's podcast, JPMorgan Chase, the Marines and Comcast.\n\nTed Cruz: The traditional conservative talk show\n\n\"Verdict with Ted Cruz\" launched during President Donald Trump's first impeachment trial in 2020, and the show -- co-hosted by Ben Ferguson -- has become the most downloaded and viewed of those hosted by potential 2028 candidates. The iHeartRadio podcast expanded this spring with a new weekend radio show, making Cruz the only sitting senator with a talk radio show and a mainstay in the GOP podcast space.\n\nThe podcast is unapologetically partisan, offering insight into conservative thinking about the latest news out of Washington and sharp criticism and mocking of Democratic elected officials. Cruz also offers a behind-the-scenes look at the daily work of a senator, recapping trips to El Salvador and his latest back-and-forth with reporters in the halls of the Capitol in between the typical news of the day breakdown.\n\n* The sponsors: Ads include those for gold and silver dealers, \"less lethal\" defense pistols, dog supplements and Patriot Mobile.\n\n* Newsmaker: Cruz sometimes makes news on the show, like he did when he said Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr's threat to revoke ABC's license over a monologue by late-night host Jimmy Kimmel was \"dangerous as hell.\"\n\n* Most viewed: The most viewed YouTube versions of the vlogcast is a two-part interview with Elon Musk taped at the White House, where they discussed life on Mars and killer robots. (Cruz: \"How real is the prospect of killer robots annihilating humanity?\" Musk: \"Twenty percent likely, maybe 10 percent.\")\n\nRon DeSantis: The Florida man\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R), whose presidential ambitions were complicated in part by his awkwardness, is the latest GOP podcaster to hit the scene. Like in his campaign and governorship, DeSantis is wonkish and cerebral in the show hosted on his official gubernatorial YouTube page, discussing issues like \"Bidenflation\" and property taxes.\n\nThe show is like a pro-Florida news conference, featuring friendly interviews with political allies about the policies that have defined DeSantis's political brand. At times the show feels like a throwback to the early days of his presidential campaign: His first episode, released in May, is a conversation with Florida Surgeon General Joseph A. Ladapo, with the governor immediately mentioning Anthony S. Fauci, vaccine passports, covid jabs and mask hysteria.\n\n* Guest list: Florida, Florida, Florida -- state chief financial officer Blaise Ingoglia, Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd and the new lieutenant governor, Jay Collins.\n\n* Sports zone: DeSantis (a former college baseball player) likes to talk Marlins, Gators, Seminoles and Hurricanes, and he has hosted retired pitcher Tom Glavine.\n\n* Cold open: \"Hello. Do you ever really own your own home? In America, local jurisdictions impose property taxes on individuals land and private residences, which raises the question, if you buy a house and you live on it, you consider that your own private property. And yet you have to continue writing a check to the government every year just for the privilege of being able to use property that you supposedly already own. And that's different than how we normally do things in America.\"\n\nGavin Newsom: The people pleaser\n\n\"This Is Gavin Newsom\" is the most listened to and downloaded podcast by a Democratic elected official, by far. The podcast is centered on \"debating without demeaning\" and has proved controversial since its launch on iHeartRadio in March, with some Democrats upset that Newsom has held friendly chats with MAGA Republicans like Charlie Kirk, Stephen K. Bannon, Sean Spicer and Newt Gingrich.\n\nMost episodes focus on biographical interviews featuring politicians, influencers and Hollywood celebrities like writer and director Ryan Murphy. Newsom frequently asks guests about how Democrats lost, and he is particularly interested in why young men left the party. He has devoted multiple episodes to conversations with gender scholars and researchers who study men.\n\n* 2028 watch: Newsom and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz (D) debated Newsom's decision to have conversations on the podcast with the Republican personalities whom Walz called \"bad guys.\" Newsom argued that it's foolhardy to \"deny they exist\" and that \"we have to first understand what their motivations are.\" Walz joked about putting them \"back under a rock\" and questioned what their motivations are beyond racism and misogyny.\n\n* The sponsors: Ads include Toyota, Simply Safe, Saks Off Fifth and podcasts like \"On Purpose\" with Jay Shetty.\n\n* Not his first rodeo: Before launching the show, Newsom co-hosted an iHeart podcast earlier this year called \"Politickin'\" with football player Marshawn Lynch and agent Doug Hendrickson.\n\nStephen A. Smith: The confrontational centrist\n\nLongtime sports commentator Stephen A. Smith, who has spurred presidential buzz, launched his political show \"Straight Shooter with Stephen A.\" in September on SiriusXM's POTUS channel. Despite downplaying his political ambitions, he fielded questions in his first episode about what he would do first as president and framed hosting a politics show as his \"destiny.\"\n\nSmith opened with a lengthy explanation of his personal politics, positioning himself as an independent voice and promising: \"I hit everyone. I don't pull punches for liberals or conservatives.\" If Smith chooses to launch a celebrity bid for the White House -- particularly if he runs as a Democrat -- his show provides plenty of fodder for future opponents. He delivers frustrated rants against party leaders and praise for Republicans. He is critical of Trump, but at his most passionate when expressing his exasperation at Democrats -- sparing his two favorites for 2028, Govs. Josh Shapiro (D-Pennsylvania) and Wes Moore (D-Maryland).\n\n* The goal: \"I'm trying to help. That's all I'm trying to do. I'm trying to prevent the Democratic Party from drifting into oblivion, never to return.\"\n\n* Guest list: The first episode featured Shapiro, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina) and Utah Gov. Spencer Cox (R), with friendly surprise calls from pals Sean Hannity and Chris Cuomo.\n\n* Ears are burning: Smith has said House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries needs to do a better job at resonating with the American people, questioned the tactics of Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-New York) and Jasmine Crockett's (D-Texas) name calling, expressed skepticism about Newsom's presidential prospects, and predicted the end of Vice President Kamala Harris's political career.\n\nDonald Trump Jr.: The MAGA warrior\n\nOn Donald Trump Jr.'s \"Triggered with Don Jr.\" -- launched in 2023 -- the president's son directly takes the MAGA message to the base with his typical combative but conversational approach. The guest list regularly features the biggest Trumpworld celebrities of the moment, including members of Congress, Cabinet members, foreign leaders and GOP influencers. The hyper-partisan show focuses on culture war issues and is framed as a direct communication method that can bypass the mainstream media. It frequently revisits major Trump moments like the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol and the Russia investigation.\n\nTrump uses the show to defend his father's agenda and sometimes offers behind-the-scenes stories about being a member of the first family, as he did when he recalled a recent trip to Scotland where he and his children watched Trump negotiate a trade deal and open a golf course, which he deemed \"epic.\" Some episodes sound more like infomercials than a typical podcast, like a recent one featuring Eric Trump promoting American Bitcoin, a cryptocurrency company partially owned by the two brothers.\n\n* The sponsors: A nonlethal self-defense weapon company, gold, an automated ammunition stockpiling service, a Rumble-affiliated coffee company branded as \"fuel for the Anti-Woke Folk.\"\n\n* Key quote: \"We are the last line of defense against a completely destructive leftist agenda at home and abroad.\"",

    "title": "Inside Gavin Newsom's Multimillion-Dollar Business Empire",
    "body": "With help from a billionaire benefactor, California's governor built a hospitality company even as he gained power in America's largest state.\n\nwealthy, imperious politician with ties to billionaires owns a hospitality empire. While serving in office, his family helps run the business empire he refused to divest. Conflict of interest allegations surrounding the properties just don't seem to stick.\n\nCalifornia governor Gavin Newsom may be posting like Donald Trump on social media, but clearly, the similarities don't end there. The rumored presidential hopeful was a businessman before and while he ran for office, and built a brand of his own: PlumpJack Group, which he started with investors including oil heir and billionaire Gordon Getty, a family friend. Today, PlumpJack is a power player in both Napa Valley's wine industry and San Francisco's social scene.\n\nNewsom was groomed for such success. His father, William, was a college friend of future California governor Jerry Brown, who appointed William to two judgeships. William Newsom was also employed by Getty as administrator of the Getty trusts. Despite dyslexia and struggling in school, Gavin went to Santa Clara University. He managed to earn a degree in political science in 1989, but had to make up a class he failed after graduating. He went into business just a few years later.\n\nNamed after the portly Shakespeare character Sir John Falstaff, PlumpJack, co-founded by Newsom, began as a wine store in San Francisco in 1992. Newsom and his partners -- including Getty, John Conover (who initially joined as one winery's general manager in 1999), Newsom's sister Hilary and his cousin Jeremy Scherer -- have since expanded it to encompass multiple wineries, restaurants, bars, stores and a hotel. Not every venture has panned out; several hotels and a sporting goods retailer have since shuttered, for example. But some have been enormously successful. The wineries alone, Forbes estimates, are worth over $400 million, so even a minority stake could be worth tens of millions of dollars to Newsom.\n\nHis exact share of each business is unclear, thanks to the vagueness of California's financial disclosure forms. After serving on San Francisco's parking and traffic commission and then on the city's board of supervisors, Newsom sold off his stakes in the San Francisco-based businesses, reportedly to Getty, for just $1.7 million when he became mayor of the city in 2004. He repurchased them (using a loan from Getty) when he left the mayor's office to become California's lieutenant governor in 2011. \"These are my babies, my life, my family,\" he told journalists in 2018 while running for governor. \"I can't sell them.\" Ultimately, Newsom put his business holdings in a blind trust and gave up control -- even signing an executive order barring state agencies from doing business with PlumpJack. Today, sister Hilary, cousin Jeremy and Conover run the company.\n\nWith Newsom rumored to be gearing up for a White House bid, Forbes combed through his state financial disclosures, real estate records and PlumpJack's websites to assemble a picture of his holdings. He doesn't list much in the way of liquid assets on his disclosure -- but, notably, is not required to list most diversified mutual funds or interest, dividend and capital gains income. His wife founded and helps run the nonprofit The Representation Project, which makes documentaries addressing gender stereotypes. Her stake in a related film production company called Girls Club Entertainment is worth between $100,000 and $1 million, according to her husband's disclosures.\n\nWhen reached for comment, Newsom spokesperson Nathan Click, who handles communications for the governor for non-state matters, would not comment on any of the holdings or Newsom's stakes in them. Click instead reiterated that the governor's holdings are in a blind trust and that he has \"no role\" in them, sending a link to coverage of the governor's blind trust decision. He declined to share Newsom's tax returns, which have previously been made available to reporters. A PlumpJack representative directed requests for comment to Click, as did a representative from the governor's office.\n\nBelow is a snapshot of his properties and businesses held through PlumpJack, including four vineyards and two restaurants; as well as his two personal residences, one closer to home in the Bay Area and one closer to work in Sacramento.\n\nNewsom opened the store that started it all in 1992 on Fillmore Street, in one of San Francisco's upscale shopping and dining districts. The shop appears to lease the ground floor of a low-rise apartment building built in 1928. Newsom says his stakes in the business and leasehold are each worth between $100,000 and $1 million, according to his financial disclosures. A second location, in the Noe Valley neighborhood, opened in 2001.\n\nThe first winery in PlumpJack's portfolio, this property opened in 1995 after Newsom and Getty wanted their own varietals to support their wine store. PlumpJack Estate has a 42-acre vineyard on a 57-acre plot that also includes an 1880s-era tasting room and production facilities. Its specialty is cabernet sauvignon. Newsom said on his 2024 disclosure that his stake is worth over $1 million and his share of revenues was over $100,000, the highest categories for each. In a recent profile for the winery's 30th anniversary, the owners claimed production of 15,000 cases and 28 employees, 20 of whom work the vineyard.\n\nCADE (named after cades, a Shakespearean term for wine casks) is the second winery in PlumpJack's portfolio -- purchased in 2005, two years into Newsom's first term as mayor of San Francisco. The whole property, on the slopes of Howell Mountain, is 54 acres, with 28 set aside in a land trust, 18 planted with grapes for cabernet sauvignon, two planted for malbec and a petit verdot, and the rest used for winery buildings, which claim gold LEED certification thanks to organic farming and solar panels. It was reportedly impacted by the Glass wildfire in 2020, which limited production, and by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, its lender, in 2022.\n\nWinery number three is located in the Stags Leap District, a valley within Napa that sports cooler temperatures. The 45-acre site opened in 2012 and grows grapes for five different types of wine: cabernet sauvignon, merlot, malbec, petit verdot and cabernet franc. The name \"Odette\" comes from the princess in Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake ballet, and the entrance to a cave on the property used for tasting and wine production aims to replicate a swan's wing, according to the architect. Newsom says his stake is worth between $100,000 and $1 million.\n\nJust down the road from CADE Estate on Howell Mountain is the largest site in which Newsom declares a direct interest: CADE 13th Vineyard, so named because it was the thirteenth bonded winery -- a fancy way of saying it was insured against excise taxes -- in California. The property boasts 82 planted acres growing mostly cabernet sauvignon, plus a few dedicated to sauvignon blanc, malbec and petit verdot. PlumpJack acquired it in 2016. Like its Estate namesake nearby, CADE 13th experiences a \"temperature inversion\" -- daytime temperatures are cooler than evenings -- which allows grapes to stay on the vine longer.\n\nThe same year PlumpJack opened a winery, it also launched a ski-in, ski-out hotel and restaurant just a few miles from Lake Tahoe. Open year-round except for seasonal breaks in November and the late spring, the PlumpJack Inn hosts 55 rooms in what used to be known as Squaw Valley, the site of the 1960 Winter Olympics (won handily by the Soviet Union). It stands out as the only remaining hotel in PlumpJack's portfolio -- the other three, one in Palm Springs and two in Carmel-by-the-Sea, closed in 2019. The Inn also included PlumpJack Sport, an equipment store hawking skis, helmets and other athletic wear, but it closed its doors last year, according to its Facebook page. Newsom declared his stake in the latter to be worth between $10,000 and $100,000 most years he's filed disclosures.\n\nThe San Francisco saloon across the street from the first PlumpJack Wine & Spirits first opened in 1913 (though the superstitious original owners put 1914 on the sign) as a watering hole for working men. PlumpJack -- spurred by Newsom, who was apparently convinced to bid on the restaurant by Pat Kelley, a realtor and the first female stock broker in San Francisco -- purchased it in 1994 and overhauled the menu. However, they made sure to keep the Balboa Burger, served on a baguette with pickles and onions, and the espresso martini. Balboa was added to San Francisco's Legacy Business Registry in 2018, which came with marketing and other assistance from the city.\n\nContinuing their expansion on Fillmore Street, PlumpJack opened the MatrixFillmore Bar just across from Balboa in 2001, taking over the Matrix nightclub, which had launched psychedelic rock band Jefferson Airplane to fame. A rebrand in 2018 to White Rabbit, a nod to the band's iconic hit, seems to have boosted the club: Newsom reports that his share of revenues has exceeded $100,000 every year since 2020, up from the $10,000 to $100,000 range it previously threw off.\n\nNewsom finally secured the governor's mansion in 2019 after eight years as second-in-command, but apparently wanted a place to live near Sacramento that wasn't owned by taxpayers. In October of that year, he and his wife purchased a 12,600-square foot home in nearby Fair Oaks for $3.7 million, borrowing $2.7 million to do so, public records show. They refinanced in 2021 for the same amount.\n\nThe day after Donald Trump won back the White House last year, Gavin Newsom appears to have purchased a home north of San Francisco Bay for $9.1 million, borrowing $6.5 million for the deal, according to public records obtained by Forbes. He did so through an LLC for which his wife is listed in California corporate records as the sole manager. According to public listings, the house is over 5,500 square feet and has six bedrooms (plenty for Newsom's four kids), a pool and a spa. It's an apparent upgrade from his previous Marin County home, reportedly sold in 2021 for $5.9 million.",

Gavin Newsom expressed enough reservations about the bills to urge state lawmakers to make some changes.\n\nSupporters of the legislation, Senate Bill 48 and Assembly Bill 715, said it was needed to protect Jewish students on campus, while opponents argued it was broadly written and would stifle free speech and classroom discussions about current events in the Middle East, including the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nNewsom, when he signed the bills, directed legislators to work quickly on a follow-up measure to address \"urgent concerns about unintended consequences.\"\n\nThe governor made similar requests for nearly a dozen other major bills he signed into law this year, including measures providing safeguards on artificial intelligence, protections for children online and banning law enforcement officers donning masks -- a direct response to federal agents hiding their identities during immigration raids across the state.\n\nNewsom's addendums provide a glimpse into the sometimes flawed or incomplete process of crafting new laws, at times hastily at the end of legislative session, requiring flaws or unresolved conflicts to be remedied later.\n\nSan Jose State University professor emeritus and political analyst Larry Gerston said governors sometimes go this route when, despite having concerns, they feel the legislation is too urgent to veto.\n\n\"I think you are looking at a situation where he thought the issue was sufficiently important and needed to go ahead and get it moving,\" he said.\n\nGerston, however, noted those with a cynical view of politics could argue governors use this tactic as a way to undo or water down legislation that -- for various political reasons -- they wanted to pass in the moment.\n\n\"Depending upon your attitude toward the governor, politics and legislation, [that viewpoint] could be right or wrong,\" he said.\n\nOne of the authors of the antisemitism bills, Assemblymember Rick Chavez Zbur (D-Los Angeles), said he will put forth another measure next year and continue working with educational organizations and the California Legislative Jewish Caucus to ensure the right balance is struck.\n\n\"The assertions that the bill is intended to prevent instruction about controversial topics, including topics related to Israel, is just not accurate,\" said Zbur, who introduced AB 715. \"We will be making sure that it's clear that instruction on complicated issues, on controversial issues, that critical education can continue to take place.\"\n\nZbur said he will reexamine a provision requiring the \"factual accuracy\" of instructional materials.\n\n\"One of the things that we've agreed to do was focus on making sure that the bill continues to meet its goal, but revisit that factually accurate language to make sure that, for example, you can continue to teach [works of] fiction in the classroom,\" he said.\n\nAnother new law flagged by Newsom bans local and federal agents from wearing masks or facial coverings during operations.\n\nThe governor approved Senate Bill 627 -- carried by Sens. Scott Wiener (D-San Francisco) and Jesse Arreguín (D-Berkeley) -- last month as a response to the Trump administration's aggressive immigration raids that are often conducted by masked agents in unmarked cars. Newsom said it was unacceptable for \"secret police\" to grab people off the streets.\n\n\"This bill establishes important transparency and public accountability measures to protect public safety, but it requires follow-up legislation,\" Newsom wrote in his signing statement. \"Given the importance of the issue, the legislature must craft a bill that prevents unnecessary masking without compromising law enforcement operations.\"\n\nNewsom said clarifications about safety gear and additional exemptions for legitimate law enforcement activities were needed.\n\n\"I read this bill as permitting the use of motorcycle or other safety helmets, sunglasses, or other standard law enforcement gear not designed or used for the purpose of hiding anyone's identity, but the follow-up legislation must also remove any uncertainty or ambiguities,\" he wrote.\n\nWiener agreed to revisit the measure.\n\n\"I'm committed to working with the Governor's office to further refine SB 627 early next year to ensure it is as workable as possible for many law enforcement officers working in good faith,\" he said.\n\nCalifornia is the first state to ban masking for federal law enforcement and the law will likely be challenged in court. The move drew ire from U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who called the legislation \"despicable\" and said forcing officers to reveal their faces increases their risk of being targeted by criminals.\n\nNewsom is also urging legislators to adjust two new tech-related laws from Assemblymember Buffy Wicks (D-Oakland).\n\nAssembly Bill 853, dubbed the California AI Transparency Act, is intended to help people identify content created by artificial intelligence. It requires large online platforms, such as social media sites, to provide accessible provenance data on uploaded content starting in 2027. Provenance data is information about the origin and modification history of online content.\n\nIn his signing statement, Newsom called the legislation a \"critical step\" but said it could interfere with privacy.\n\n\"Some stakeholders remain concerned that provisions of the bill, while well-intentioned, present implementation challenges that could lead to unintended consequences, including impairment of user privacy,\" he wrote. \"I encourage the legislature to enact follow up legislation in 2026, before the law takes effect, to address these technical feasibility issues.\"\n\nAssembly Bill 1043 aims to help prevent children from viewing inappropriate content online. It directs operating system providers to allow parents to input their children's ages when setting up equipment such as laptops or smartphones, and then requires users to be grouped in different age brackets. It gained approval from tech companies including Meta and Google while others raised concerns.\n\n\"Streaming services and video game developers contend that this bill's framework, while well-suited to traditional software applications, does not fit their respective products,\" Newsom wrote in his signing statement. \"Many of these companies have existing age verification systems in place, addressing complexities such as multi-user accounts shared by a family and user profiles utilized across multiple devices.\"\n\nThe governor urged lawmakers to address those concerns before the law is set to take effect in 2027.",

J.B. Pritzker, a potential rival for the 2028 Democratic Party presidential nomination, who has claimed that the deployment of the National Guard to crime-ridden Democrat-run cities is really Trump's ploy to declare martial law and end democratic rule.\n\nRegardless, Dhillon pointed out that President Joe Biden also sent election monitors to California:\n\nAs Fox News noted:\n\nThe Department of Justice sent election monitors to California twice during the Biden administration, during the 2022 general election and the 2024 general election.\n\n\"This is not a federal election,\" Newsom's press office posted on X. \"The US DOJ has no business or basis to interfere with this election. This is solely about whether California amends our state constitution.\n\n...\n\nThe Biden Justice Department sent election resources to several non-federal elections as well, including Alaska municipal elections in October 2023, a New Jersey off-year general election in 2023 and a Mississippi off-year general in 2023.\n\nNewsom and Pritzker appear to believe that Democratic Party primary voters are more interested in how vigorously candidates opposed Trump than how effectively they governed or what they have achieved.",

    "body": "Republican Steve Hilton leads the latest poll for the California governor's race in 2026, in a stunning result that indicates an electorate hungry for change.\n\nThe poll, by Emerson College, confirms that the Golden State is as left-wing as ever. Fully 57% support Gov. Gavin Newsom's (D) proposal to gerrymander California's congressional districts, overriding a constitutional requirement for an independent redistricting commission.\n\nHowever, Hilton -- a conservative commentator and policy analyst fiercely critical of governance in the state -- is leading the poll, ahead of every major Democratic Party candidate, including former Rep. Katie Porter.\n\nHilton's lead is well within the poll's 3% margin of error. And overall, the Democratic candidates in the poll outweigh the Republican candidates. But aside from Porter, there is no Democrat polling in double digits. And Porter's campaign is largely believed to be over after a recent explosive tirade against a CBS interviewer.\n\nThe fact that a Republican leads the poll could entice another, stronger Democratic candidate to enter the race. Sen. Alex Padilla (D-CA), largely a nonentity in Washington, is considered a possible contender.\n\nNewsom's approval rating in the poll is just 48%, though that is its highest mark over the past year.",

    "title": "California Spends $140 Million to Prop Up Planned Parenthood",
    "body": "California this week became the fourth state to allocate taxpayer dollars to support Planned Parenthood in a move to offset the loss of federal funding established by Republicans and President Donald Trump.\n\nCalifornia taxpayers will give Planned Parenthood more than $140 million to keep 109 clinics open, Gov. Gavin Newsom announced on Thursday. The state joins Washington, Colorado, and New Mexico, which have also come to the abortion provider's aid with state funding.\n\n\"California is a reproductive freedom state, and this latest investment continues to show our belief in protecting access to essential health care in times of distress,\" Newsom said in a statement. \"Trump's efforts to defund Planned Parenthood put all our communities at risk as people seek basic health care from these community providers.\"\n\nPlanned Parenthood reportedly was planning to eliminate primary care at clinics in Orange and San Bernardino counties starting in December. Five other clinics in the Bay Area, Santa Cruz, and Central Valley, shuttered in recent months over federal efforts to defund the organization.\n\n\"The Planned Parenthood affiliates in California are grateful to Governor Newsom and our allies in the Legislature for taking this necessary step to keep Planned Parenthood health centers open and able to provide critical services as they weather the impacts of the federal defund,\" said Jodi Hicks, President and CEO of Planned Parenthood Affiliates of California.\n\nRight to life advocates have criticized Planned Parenthood for decades over its abortion services, often located in poor neighborhoods. A 1977 a law banned federal funding for abortions, but critics have alleged the money the organization receives for other clinical services helps fuel the abortion procedures.\n\nThe spending bill passed this year by Republicans and signed by the president prohibits Planned Parenthood from receiving Medicaid money for its services, not only for abortions but also for mammograms, pap smears, birth control, and sexually transmitted infection testing.\n\nDr. Janet Jacobson, medical director of the clinics in Orange and San Bernardino counties, told CalMatters the federal actions are \"destroying our primary care program.\"\n\n\"It's inhumane to take away people's health care,\" Jacobson said. \"Folks that have Medi-Cal should be able to see the provider of their choice for primary care.\"\n\nPlanned Parenthood needs about $27 million a month to operate all its local facilities, Hicks told CalMatters. The organization claims abortions account for less than ten percent of its services.\n\n\"President Trump and Congressional Republicans' targeted attacks on Planned Parenthood are not only unconscionable, but a deliberate effort to undermine California's values and promise of reproductive freedom,\" Hicks charged in her statement. \"Today's funding commitment is critical to protecting vulnerable Californians' constitutional right to access reproductive health care.\"\n\nLawmakers in Oregon and New York are also reportedly considering giving public money to the organization.",

I have lived my entire career as a life of service, and it's in my bones,\" she told the BBC during an interview to be aired on \"Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg.\"\n\nIn keeping with the possibility of another try at the presidency, Harris dismissed polls that put her as an also-ran behind California Gov. Gavin Newsom as the Democratic nominee in the next presidential election.\n\n\"If I listened to polls, I would have not run for my first office, or my second office -- and I certainly wouldn't be sitting here,\" she told the network.\n\nNewsweek reported a few of the latest surveys:\n\nA Politico-Citrin Center-Possibility Lab survey, conducted between July 31 and August 11, put California Governor Gavin Newsom ahead with 25 percent support among Democrats and independents, compared to Harris' 19 percent.\n\nAnalysis on Friday by pollster Lakshya Jain showed that Harris has one of the highest unfavorability ratings among senior Democrats, with 54 percent saying they have a somewhat or very unfavorable view of her.\n\nIn the interview, Harris replayed her 2024 campaign message criticizing President Donald Trump as an authoritarian, adding some new shots based on his ten months in office.\n\nShe brought up the suspension of late night ABC host Jimmy Kimmel for lying about Charlie Kirk's murder, placing the host's layoff at Trump's feet, though no evidence has emerged to date that the president was involved in ABC's decision.\n\n\"You look at what has happened in terms of how he has weaponized, for example, federal agencies going around after political satirists...\" she told the Sunday show. \"His skin is so thin he couldn't endure criticism from a joke, and attempted to shut down an entire media organization in the process.\"\n\n\"He said he would weaponize the Department of Justice,\" she also claimed. \"And he has done exactly that.\"\n\nHarris also slammed business leaders and others for too easily supporting Trump and agreeing to his wishes.\n\nShe told the network, \"There are many... that have capitulated since day one, who are bending the knee at the foot of a tyrant, I believe for many reasons, including they want to be next to power, because they want to perhaps have a merger approved or avoid an investigation.\n\nWhen the British network asked for a response to Harris's comments about the president, a White House spokesperson dismissed former vice president's remarks\n\n\"When Kamala Harris lost the election in a landslide, she should've taken the hint -- the American people don't care about her absurd lies,\" spokeswoman Abigail Jackson told the network.\n\n\"Or maybe she did take the hint and that's why she's continuing to air her grievances to foreign publications.\"",

They are not law enforcement officers or federal agents.\n\nFor decades, the Justice Department's civil rights division has sent attorneys and staff members to monitor polling places across the country in both federal and non-federal elections. The monitors are tasked with ensuring compliance with federal voting rights laws.\n\nThe Justice Department's Civil Rights Division enforces a number of statutes protecting the right to vote. That includes the Voting Rights Act, which prohibits intimidation and threats against those who are casting ballots or counting votes. And it includes the Americans with Disabilities Act, which mandates that election officials ensure people with disabilities have the full and equal opportunity to vote.",

Greg Abbott, not too long after California's redistricting rally, signed into law new congressional maps for his state, designed to give Republicans five extra seats courtesy of the Lone Star State in the 2026 midterm elections.\n\nShould California voters approve Prop. 50, those gains could be neutralized; California's redistricting plan is meant to give Democrats an additional five seats.\n\nBut in the weeks since Texas and California launched competing redistricting efforts, two more states have OK'd new, gerrymandered maps meant to boost the GOP: Missouri in September, and just this week, North Carolina, as well.\n\nFor those keeping score at home, that means two more notches in the Republican column in the redistricting race.\n\nCould that be a boost for Prop. 50 with a little more than a week to go until Election Day?\n\nIt can't hurt, supporters said.\n\n\"I'm sure it will help,\" said Florice Hoffman, chair of the Democratic Party of Orange County, which is involved in get-out-the-vote efforts in favor of Prop. 50.\n\n\"North Carolina is the latest state to bend the knee for Trump's election rigging scheme,\" said Hannah Milgrom, a spokesperson for the Yes on 50 campaign, \"and it's more proof of why we must pass Prop. 50.\"\n\nDespite it not being, originally, an election year in California, already more than 4 million ballots have already been returned (through the mail or at various drop-off locations), as of the secretary of state's latest tally on Thursday, Oct. 23. That's a little more than 17% of the nearly 23.3 million ballots issued through the mail to the state's registered voters.\n\n\"We're seeing some pretty extraordinary numbers of early votes that have already been cast,\" Newsom said during a recent event in support of Prop. 50, alongside former President Barack Obama.\n\nSupporters and opponents of Prop. 50 alike say the high interest in the special election may be attributed to Trump, rather than more states moving forward with partisan redistricting.\n\n\"I can't think of anything in my lifetime where we've had an election that is specifically, metaphorically, poking the president of the United States in the nose the way this does,\" said Michael Trujillo, a Democratic strategist in Southern California. \"This is the first time in recent modern history that voters in one state can vote for a proposition that (angers) Donald Trump. That makes so many happy Democrats in California because it neutralizes the shenanigans in other states, and it upsets the White House.\"\n\nThe Yes on 50 campaign, its spokesperson, Milgrom, said, is engaging voters with the message of: \"Prop. 50 is America's best hope to stop Trump's power grab and ensure a fair election in 2026.\"\n\nLongtime Republican strategist Jon Fleischman also points to the Trump effect in the election.\n\n\"I don't think the argument for passing Prop. 50 has anything to do with redistricting,\" said Fleischman, who is opposed to Prop. 50. \"They've turned that campaign into a referendum on Donald Trump.\"\n\n\"I don't think people are voting for this because of the fact that Texas did it. I don't think it's the motivating factor for voters,\" he said.\n\nA recent CBS News poll seemingly backs up that opinion.\n\nAmong likely California voters who are picking yes on Prop. 50, only 18% said Trump was not a reason for their decision. A whopping 75%, however, said they were voting yes to oppose Trump.\n\nMeanwhile, 62% of likely voters surveyed said they were choosing yes on Prop. 50, while 38% said no.\n\nThe poll surveyed more than 1,500 registered voters between Oct. 16-21 with a margin of error of +/- 3.6 points for likely voters.\n\nNorth Carolina legislators earlier this week approved a new congressional map meant to give Republicans one extra seat in the U.S. House by targeting the district held by Democratic Rep. Don Davis in the northeastern part of the state. There, Republicans hold majorities in both chambers of the legislature, and the state's Democratic governor, Josh Stein, is prevented from vetoing redistricting maps.",

    "body": "Pro-life activists with 40 Days for Life gather outside abortion clinics nationwide. (Credit: 40 Days for Life)\n\nCalifornia officials are giving Planned Parenthood $140 million to keep 109 clinics open and offset the financial strain from cuts imposed by Republicans in Washington, Democrat Gov. Gavin Newsom announced.\n\nNewsom said the move affirms the state's continued commitment to abortion access for women in the Golden State amid efforts by President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans to shut down Planned Parenthood.\n\n\"California is a reproductive freedom state, and this latest investment continues to show our belief in protecting access to essential health care in times of distress,\" Newsom said in a statement on Thursday. \"Trump's efforts to defund Planned Parenthood put all our communities at risk as people seek basic health care from these community providers.\"\n\nState lawmakers will also address the issue when the legislature reconvenes in January.\n\nAPPEALS COURT HEARS MEDICAID FRAUD CASE THAT COULD COST PLANNED PARENTHOOD $1.8 BILLION\n\nPlanned Parenthood had announced it would eliminate primary care at clinics in Orange and San Bernardino counties starting in December. Five other clinics in the Bay Area, Santa Cruz and Central Valley, also shuttered in recent months over federal efforts to defund the organization.\n\nDr. Janet Jacobson, medical director of the Orange and San Bernardino counties clinics, told CalMatters the federal actions are \"destroying our primary care program.\"\n\n\"It's inhumane to take away people's health care,\" Jacobson said. \"Folks that have Medi-Cal should be able to see the provider of their choice for primary care.\"\n\nPlanned Parenthood needs about $27 million a month to operate all its local facilities, Jodi Hicks, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Affiliates of California, told CalMatters.\n\n\"The Planned Parenthood affiliates in California are grateful to Governor Newsom and our allies in the Legislature for taking this necessary step to keep Planned Parenthood health centers open and able to provide critical services as they weather the impacts of the federal defund,\" Hicks said in a statement.\n\nCalifornia is the fourth state to allocate public funds to support Planned Parenthood, joining Washington, Colorado and New Mexico. Lawmakers in Oregon and New York are also considering giving public money to the organization.\n\nDEMOCRATS ESCALATE ANTI-TRUMP LAWFARE BY TARGETING CONGRESS IN PLANNED PARENTHOOD FUNDING FIGHT\n\nRepublicans in the nation's capital and across the country have targeted Planned Parenthood over abortion services. Trump's spending bill signed over the summer prohibited Planned Parenthood from receiving Medicaid money for its services, including abortions, mammograms, pap smears, birth control and sexually transmitted infection testing.\n\nFacilities in GOP-led states with abortion restrictions have also been forced to cease the procedures following the 2022 Supreme Court decision that overturned Roe V. Wade and returned the power to make laws regarding abortion back to the states.\n\nPlanned Parenthood facilities have been shuttering in various states across the country, including California and New York. Planned Parenthood Mar Monte -- which operates 30 health centers along the California coast, Central Valley and Nevada -- shuttered five health centers in July after Trump blocked Planned Parenthood's funding.\n\nMar Monte Chief of Staff Andrew Adams said the organization is working on ways to maintain its financial stability. Adams said the closures helped keep services at the organization's other clinics until the end of the year but that it could be met with a \"financial cliff\" in the new year.\n\nPRO-LIFE GROUP 'ELATED' AFTER PLANNED PARENTHOOD SHUTTERS HOUSTON FACILITIES: 'TREMENDOUS VICTORY'\n\n\"We are planning for an environment where there is no federal funding,\" Adams told CalMatters. \"What that looks like is having to potentially charge patients some amount of money for services we provide.\"\n\nThe organization has claimed that abortions make up only 3% of its services, but pro-life groups contend that the clinics' closures in states with abortion bans prove that to be false.\n\nCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"If that were true, they wouldn't be closing all these facilities in pro-life states where you can't do abortions. So that's hardly believable anymore in 2025,\" 40 Days for Life CEO and founder Shawn Carney told Fox News Digital in August.\n\nNewsom, California lawmakers and Planned Parenthood have spent much of the year searching for a solution to keep the organization afloat without federal dollars, according to CalMatters.\n\nBut with a multibillion-dollar state deficit, that has been a challenging goal.",

    "title": "Andy Beshear Defends Gavin Newsom After Bill Maher Claims the Trump Trolling Has 'Jumped the Shark'",
    "body": "\"I think he is standing up. I think he's pushing back,\" the governor of Kentucky says\n\nAndy Beshear stood by his Democrat peer Gavin Newsom after Bill Maher called out the latter's social media trolling of Donald Trump.\n\nThe governor of Kentucky, who appeared on \"Real Time With Bill Maher\" Friday, maintained a united front for the Democratic party, as he vocally applauded his fellow governor for the work he's done in California.\n\nThe discussion kicked off when Maher suggested Newsom -- who has repeatedly mimicked Trump's feisty social media style on X this year -- had \"jumped the shark\" with his online antics.\n\n\"Is that something you endorse? Do you think it's an effective technique? Would you do it? Should we keeping doing? Should we stop doing it?\" Maher grilled the Southern politician.\n\nInitially, Beshear didn't address Newsom's social media behavior and instead addressed the Calif. governor's Prop 50 measure, which will authorize temporary changes to the state's congressional district maps -- directly combating similar action being done in Texas.\n\n\"He taking the fight back,\" Beshear noted. \"I wish we didn't have to be there. I wish we didn't have to do it. But, once Texas changed the rules of the game, we all have to play by the same rules. And so, I appreciate his leadership there.\"\n\nMaher then cut Beshear off, noting this wasn't an example of trolling, rather a strategy tackling a real issue.\n\n\"He's pushing back in his way,\" Beshear went on. \"It's not my way. It's just not me. But I think everybody has to take their style and do what's best for their people. But I think he is standing up. I think he's pushing back and I think it takes all of us in our own ways.\"\n\nBeshear later expressed that he was feeling optimistic heading into midterm elections.\n\n\"I think people don't like extremism and people feel the country may have swung too far one way and now is swinging too far the other way and it's impacting their daily lives,\" he concluded. \"But, even before we get to midterms, the Democrats are going to win the governorship of both New Jersey and Virginia. We're working really hard to make that happen.\"",

    "body": "California Gov. Gavin Newsom slammed President Donald Trump's administration with a fact check over its latest effort to claim his state's tolerance of immigrants is getting people killed.\n\nThe controversy stems from a Fox News report from Bill Melugin, posted to X on Friday, that \"An official with the California State Transportation Agency confirms to @FoxNews that Indian illegal alien truck driver Jashanpreet Singh's California CDL is also a federal REAL ID, 'which he was entitled to receive given the federal gov's confirmation of his legal status.'\" Singh is currently facing charges for a deadly DUI.\n\nAfter this post went up, the official account for the Department of Homeland Security blasted Newsom over the incident.\n\n\"Newsom's pro-illegal alien policies COST LIVES. Now that California's policies have led to disaster, he's attempting to shift the blame,\" said the account. \"In Gavin Newsom's California, possessing employment authorization is enough to grant someone a commercial driver's license (CDL). CALIFORNIA is solely responsible for deciding who they give a CDL to. California's sanctuary state policies are 100% to blame for providing an individual who was NOT an American citizen, and did NOT have legal status with a CDL. Now Gavin's actions have killed Americans.\"\n\nNewsom, though, was quick to hit back, and accused the Trump administration of lying.\n\n\"Lies. Kosplay Kristi and Road Rules Duffy can't keep their story straight!\" said the account for Newsom's press office. First, the post said, \"Noncitizens are eligible for CDLs -- Kristi and Sean should know that!\" Second, \"They say he is 'illegal' but the Trump Admin CONFIRMED his legal presence and renewed his work permit ... The Trump Admin renewed his work authorization -- allowing him to be eligible for a CDL.\"\n\n\"And since Kristi and Sean need reminding: CA-licensed CDL holders are involved in fatal crashes at a rate FAR BELOW the national average,\" Newsom's account added. \"They may want to look into Texas, which has a 50% HIGHER rate than California.\"\n\nNewsom has emerged as one of the most confrontational Democratic governors on social media, often trolling Trump by writing manifestos in his own writing style -- and engineering a redistricting plan, to be decided by voters next month, that retaliates against the GOP's mid-decade gerrymanders at Trump's orders.",

Gavin Newsom violated federal law by upgrading the driver's license of the illegal migrant trucker accused of causing a horrific, drug-fueled pile-up that killed three people and wounded several others, a bombshell new report claims.\n\nTransportation Secretary Sean Duffy blamed Newsom for Tuesday's deadly crash, alleging state officials unlawfully upgraded Jashanpreet Singh's commercial license weeks after a new federal rule went into effect barring illegal immigrants from holding such privileges, according to a DOT report released Friday.\n\nThe restrictions, which require states to verify an applicant's legal status, took effect on Sept. 26 -- while the 21-year-old Indian national's driving rights were expanded on Oct. 15, the report states.\n\n\"My prayers are with the families of the victims of this tragedy,\" Duffy said in a statement.\n\n\"It would have never happened if Gavin Newsom had followed our new rules. California broke the law and now three people are dead and two are hospitalized. These people deserve justice. There will be consequences.\"\n\nSingh was initially issued a restricted CDL in the Golden State on June 27, confining him to intrastate travel, according to the DOT's report.\n\nWhen the new regulations took effect, the federal agency informed California officials of \"significant compliance failures\" related to the issuance of truckers' licenses and gave them 30 days to audit its practices and void or rescind all unexpired CDLs, the report states.\n\nThe state's Department of Motor Vehicles lifted Singh's driving restrictions on Oct. 15 -- his birthday -- without enforcing the stricter standards mandated by the DOT's new emergency rule, officials said.\n\n\"Gavin Newsom was explicitly warned California's CDL program was dangerously broken,\" the report charged.\n\n\"The USDOT's emergency rule was issued to explicitly prevent drivers like Singh from getting behind the wheel of commercial motor vehicles.\"\n\nNewsom's office did not immediately respond to The Post's request for comment.\n\nSingh was allegedly under the influence of drugs when he plowed his semi-truck into slow-moving traffic on the 10 Freeway in San Bernardino County Tuesday afternoon, cops said.\n\nThe wreck, which was caught on dashcam, killed three people and left at least four others injured.\n\nHarrowing footage showed the moment Singh allegedly slammed his red big rig into the back of an SUV -- before crashing into several other vehicles and erupting into flames.\n\nSingh is believed to have entered the US in 2022 via the southern border before he was released into the country by the Biden administration, Department of Homeland officials said.\n\nUS Immigration and Customs Enforcement has since lodged an arrest detainer -- a former request for local cops to notify the feds before he is freed.\n\nHe was charged with vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated and driving under the influence.",

    "body": "After months of financial strain, Planned Parenthood will get a $140 million lifeline to offset losses it sustained after Congress in July cut funding for the health system, Gov. Gavin Newsom announced Thursday.\n\nThe money will help Planned Parenthood keep 109 California clinics open. In a statement, Newsom said the move reflects the state's continued commitment to abortion and reproductive health care.\n\n\"Trump's efforts to defund Planned Parenthood put all our communities at risk as people seek basic health care from these community providers,\" Newsom said.\n\nLawmakers will also take up the issue in January when the Legislature reconvenes.\n\nThe news comes a week after the nonprofit organization announced it would eliminate primary care at clinics in Orange and San Bernardino counties. Five other clinics also closed in July in the Bay Area, Santa Cruz and Central Valley, all in response to federal defunding.\n\nPlanned Parenthood needs roughly $27 million monthly to operate all of its local facilities, according to Jodi Hicks, president and chief executive of Planned Parenthood Affiliates of California, the organization's statewide advocacy group.\n\n\"We're incredibly grateful that we've found a way to get some funding out to our Planned Parenthood health centers so they can remain operating and continue services,\" Hicks said.\n\nCalifornia is the fourth state, following Washington, Colorado and New Mexico, to pledge public funds to keep Planned Parenthood afloat. Lawmakers in Oregon and New York are also considering similar moves.\n\nRepublicans have lambasted and targeted Planned Parenthood for decades over contraceptive and abortion services. A 1977 law banned federal funding for abortions, but this summer President Donald Trump took additional steps to cut down the nation's largest abortion provider.\n\nHis sweeping tax and budget bill prohibited Planned Parenthood from receiving Medicaid dollars for any kinds of services, including mammograms, pap smears, birth control and sexually transmitted infection testing and treatment.\n\nAccording to Planned Parenthood, abortions account for less than 10% of its services, while other reproductive health services make up the bulk of medical care provided.\n\nFederal funding losses have forced Planned Parenthood to close clinics across the country, where half of all patients rely on Medicaid. In California, where 80% of Planned Parenthood patients have Medicaid -- known as Medi-Cal in the state -- the losses are even greater.\n\n\"There was definitely an outsized impact on California,\" Hicks said.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers, Newsom and Planned Parenthood have spent most of the year searching for a funding solution that protects reproductive health access without cash from federal coffers. But, faced with a multibillion-dollar state deficit, solutions have been slow to appear and challenging to maintain.\n\n\"We'll fight like hell to maintain access to care in the coming months and years,\" said Assembly Majority Leader Cecilia Aguiar-Curry, a Davis Democrat who leads the Legislative Women's Caucus,\n\nEven with the state's pledge to protect sexual and reproductive health care, Planned Parenthood clinics face growing uncertainty driven by federal grant freezes, lawsuits and even some proposed state cuts.\n\nLast week, Planned Parenthood in Orange and San Bernardino counties announced facilities would close primary care services on Dec. 13. The group, which runs nine health centers, added primary care more than a decade ago to serve low-income patients unable to find appointments elsewhere.\n\nDr. Janet Jacobson, medical director of the Orange and San Bernardino counties clinics, said the federal actions are \"destroying our primary care program.\" She said she worries patients with urgent mental health needs or chronic conditions won't be able to quickly find another provider. Many communities in the region have too few doctors, according to state data.\n\nRoughly 13,000 patients will lose access to care and Planned Parenthood will lay off 77 staff.\n\n\"It's inhumane to take away people's health care,\" Jacobson said. \"Folks that have Medi-Cal should be able to see the provider of their choice for primary care.\"\n\nAguiar-Curry called the loss of primary care \"unacceptable and dangerous.\"\n\nFarther north, Planned Parenthood Mar Monte -- which runs 30 health centers along the California coast, Central Valley and Nevada -- closed five health centers in July shortly after Trump blocked Planned Parenthood's funding.\n\nMar Monte Chief of Staff Andrew Adams said the organization has been working to maintain its financial stability. The closures helped preserve services at the organization's other clinics until the end of the year, but Adams warned that it could hit a \"financial cliff\" in January.\n\n\"We are planning for an environment where there is no federal funding,\" Adams said. \"What that looks like is having to potentially charge patients some amount of money for services we provide.\"\n\nOther Planned Parenthood groups in the state are exploring ways to cut costs and boost revenue while keeping clinics open for patients.\n\nDr. Neda Ashtari, a former Planned Parenthood and Medi-Cal patient, emphasized the importance of ensuring more than 1 million patients continue to have access to cancer screenings and other reproductive health services. When Ashtari was a teenager, her mother died of breast cancer after missing routine scans that could have detected the cancer earlier, she said.\n\n\"It really crystallizes that this preventative care is the difference between life or death,\" Ashtari said.",

    "body": "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy joins 'America Reports' to break down a fatal California crash, allegedly caused by an illegal immigrant, and how the suspect was able to obtain a driver's license.\n\nTransportation Secretary Sean Duffy accused California Gov. Gavin Newsom of violating new federal commercial licensing rules by purportedly allowing an immigrant in the country illegally to maintain a commercial driver's license (CDL).\n\nThat truck driver is accused of causing a freeway crash that resulted in three fatalities on Tuesday in California.\n\nNewsom is blaming the federal government for the crash, arguing its policies ultimately allowed the suspect to receive a license. Duffy rejected that claim.\n\nThe dispute comes as the transportation secretary threatens to withhold millions in federal highway funds from California and expands a federal review into how non-citizens acquire state-issued licenses.\n\nWHITE HOUSE SAYS CALIFORNIA GRANTED LICENSE TO ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT TRUCKER CHARGED IN FATAL DUI CRASH\n\n\"Had Gavin followed our rules per DOT, this guy would have never been on the road. Three more people would be alive,\" Duffy said Friday on \"America Reports.\"\n\nThe deadly crash occurred Tuesday on a Southern California freeway. Jashanpreet Singh, a 21-year-old Indian national, allegedly drove a semi-truck while under the influence, causing a multi-car pile-up with three fatalities.\n\nAccording to the Department of Transportation, California violated new federal rules by upgrading Singh's non-domiciled CDL despite an emergency rule and compliance notice issued Sept. 26.\n\n\"If California had complied with the Secretary's emergency rule and prevented the upgrade of this individual's driving privileges earlier this month, he would have never been able to get behind his big rig,\" according to a department statement.\n\nThe rule was designed to restrict eligibility for non-citizen licenses and require states to verify applicants' legal status.\n\nBLUE STATE INVESTIGATES HOW ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT TRUCKER GOT LICENSE BEFORE DEADLY FLORIDA CRASH\n\nCalifornia first issued Singh his CDL in June, but upgraded it in mid-October, weeks after the new federal restrictions took effect, according to the Department of Transportation.\n\nNewsom's press office called the crash \"tragic,\" but accused the Trump administration of trying to score \"political points.\"\n\n\"This is tragic, and as with every tragedy over the last ten months, Secretary Noem has ordered Secretary Duffy to look for every opportunity to manipulate the facts to score cheap political points,\" his office wrote on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nBLUE STATES DEFLECT BLAME IN TRUMP PROBE AFTER ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT TRUCKER CRASH KILLS 3 IN FLORIDA\n\n\"The FEDERAL government approved and renewed this individual's FEDERAL employment authorization multiple times - which allowed him to obtain a commercial driver's license in accordance with FEDERAL law.\"\n\n\"It's nice to see Gavin tap-dance in a tweet, good for him,\" he said.\n\n\"But the truth is, we do set the guidelines by which licenses can be issued. We sent that guidance out. Gavin Newsom said, 'I'm not going to follow it. I'm going to allow this foreigner to get an upgraded license.' That was Gavin Newsom's choice. The states issue commercial driver's licenses. We give the guidance, they issue them.\"\n\n\"California rules and regulations for Commercial Driver's Licensing are consistent with federal law,\" Newsom's office told Fox News Digital in part.\n\nThe California Transportation Agency posted on X: \"MISINFORMATION ALERT: The state does not determine commercial driver's license eligibility. The FEDERAL government approves and renews all FEDERAL employment authorization documents that allows individuals to work and obtain commercial driver's licenses.\"",

    "body": "Governor Gavin Newsom said President Donald Trump sending federal troops to San Francisco is part of the \"authoritarian playbook.\"\n\n* Two people were wounded after Coast Guard personnel shot at a U-Haul truck outside a base in Alameda, California.\n\n* The incident occurred hours after a protest against a potential federal immigration crackdown at the same location.\n\n* The FBI is investigating after the driver allegedly refused orders to stop and attempted to ram the main gate.\n\n* A protester at the scene described the U-Haul driver as an \"independent actor\" not involved with the demonstration.\n\nOAKLAND, CA ‒ Two people were wounded following a late-night shooting outside a U.S. Coast Guard base where protesters were rallying against a deferred federal immigration crackdown in the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\nThe FBI is investigating the incident, which occurred around 10 p.m. on Oct. 23 after Coast Guard security personnel opened fire on a U-Haul truck that refused multiple orders to stop. The truck attempted to ram the main gate at Coast Guard Island in Alameda, California, said Lt. Krystal Wolfe, a Coast Guard spokesperson.\n\n\"The driver failed to comply and proceeded to put the vehicle in reverse ‒ suddenly accelerating backwards at a high rate of speed directly toward them,\" Wolfe said in an emailed statement. \"When the vehicle's actions posed a direct threat to the safety of Coast Guard and security personnel, law enforcement officers discharged several rounds of defensive live fire.\"\n\nThe U-Haul driver was wounded in the stomach and is being held in custody for a mental health evaluation, Wolfe said. A second shooting victim, a bystander, was struck by a fragment, taken to a local hospital, and later released, Wolfe said.\n\nThe Oct. 23 shooting occurred several hours after hundreds of protesters marched in front of the entrance to Coast Guard Island, an artificial island between Oakland and Alameda that houses several major Coast Guard commands.\n\nCustoms and Border Protection agents were staging on the island in preparation for a federal immigration crackdown ordered by the Trump adminstration, but then put on hold at the last minute.\n\nDuring the protest, at least two demonstrators were taken into custody by the California Highway Patrol for obstruction, after repeatedly being told to clear the Coast Guard Island entrance to allow vehicles to leave the island.\n\nThose arrests came hours after President Donald Trump paused the deployment of federal agents to San Francisco, citing a call with the city's mayor, Daniel Lurie ‒ but before the public was told of the change in plans.\n\nThe president has sent troops into a handful of Democratic-led cities across the country since June, including Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., Chicago, Portland, Oregon, and Memphis, Tennessee.\n\nProtester calls U-Haul driver shot an 'independent actor'\n\nKris Ness, who said he'd been at the Oct. 23 immigration protest throughout the day, described the U-Haul driver shot by the Coast Guard to KTVU-TV as an \"independent actor\" who wasn't involved with the protest.\n\nNess said the driver showed up to the scene around 9:30 p.m., broke through a barrier, and \"reversed toward the Coast Guard.\"\n\nNess also told the TV station he saw the Coast Guard fire up to 50 rounds, and said that an \"innocent bystander was struck.\" Ness said he ran over to help the shooting victim before he was taken to the hospital.\n\n\"He was definitely bleeding, though,\" Ness said.\n\nNess said the driver attempted to get away but was eventually arrested.\n\nNess said that the group of protesters he was with told the Coast Guard that they were peaceful and not connected with the driver, as the Oakland police and Alameda County sheriff's deputies arrived to secure the scene.\n\n\"In fact, we tried to stop them,\" Ness told the TV station. \"It's a really terrible picture for the rest of us, especially. You know, aside from the fact that he was a completely independent actor, he refused to talk to us as well. It was all around just really weird and dangerous and unfortunate.\"",

    "title": "California Gives Planned Parenthood $140M to Help Keep 109 Clinics Open",
    "body": "After months of financial strain, Planned Parenthood will get a $140 million lifeline to offset losses it sustained after Congress in July cut funding for the health system, Gov. Gavin Newsom announced Thursday.\n\nThe money will help Planned Parenthood keep 109 California clinics open. In a statement, Newsom said the move reflects the state's continued commitment to abortion and reproductive health care.\n\n\"Trump's efforts to defund Planned Parenthood put all our communities at risk as people seek basic health care from these community providers,\" Newsom said.\n\nLawmakers will also take up the issue in January when the Legislature reconvenes.\n\nThe news comes a week after the nonprofit organization announced it would eliminate primary care at clinics in Orange and San Bernardino counties. Five other clinics also closed in July in the Bay Area, Santa Cruz and Central Valley, all in response to federal defunding.\n\nPlanned Parenthood needs roughly $27 million monthly to operate all of its local facilities, according to Jodi Hicks, president and chief executive of Planned Parenthood Affiliates of California, the organization's statewide advocacy group.\n\n\"We're incredibly grateful that we've found a way to get some funding out to our Planned Parenthood health centers so they can remain operating and continue services,\" Hicks said.\n\nCalifornia is the fourth state, following Washington, Colorado and New Mexico, to pledge public funds to keep Planned Parenthood afloat. Lawmakers in Oregon and New York are also considering similar moves.\n\nRepublicans have lambasted and targeted Planned Parenthood for decades over contraceptive and abortion services. A 1977 law banned federal funding for abortions, but this summer President Donald Trump took additional steps to cut down the nation's largest abortion provider.\n\nHis sweeping tax and budget bill prohibited Planned Parenthood from receiving Medicaid dollars for any kinds of services, including mammograms, pap smears, birth control and sexually transmitted infection testing and treatment.\n\nAccording to Planned Parenthood, abortions account for less than 10% of its services, while other reproductive health services make up the bulk of medical care provided.\n\nFederal funding losses have forced Planned Parenthood to close clinics across the country, where half of all patients rely on Medicaid. In California, where 80% of Planned Parenthood patients have Medicaid -- known as Medi-Cal in the state -- the losses are even greater.\n\n\"There was definitely an outsized impact on California,\" Hicks said.\n\nPrimary care closures ripple across the state\n\nDemocratic lawmakers, Newsom and Planned Parenthood have spent most of the year searching for a funding solution that protects reproductive health access without cash from federal coffers. But, faced with a multibillion-dollar state deficit, solutions have been slow to appear and challenging to maintain.\n\n\"We'll fight like hell to maintain access to care in the coming months and years,\" said Assembly Majority Leader Cecilia Aguiar-Curry, a Davis Democrat who leads the Legislative Women's Caucus,\n\nEven with the state's pledge to protect sexual and reproductive health care, Planned Parenthood clinics face growing uncertainty driven by federal grant freezes, lawsuits and even some proposed state cuts.\n\nLast week, Planned Parenthood in Orange and San Bernardino counties announced facilities would close primary care services on Dec. 13. The group, which runs nine health centers, added primary care more than a decade ago to serve low-income patients unable to find appointments elsewhere.\n\nDr. Janet Jacobson, medical director of the Orange and San Bernardino counties clinics, said the federal actions are \"destroying our primary care program.\" She said she worries patients with urgent mental health needs or chronic conditions won't be able to quickly find another provider. Many communities in the region have too few doctors, according to state data.\n\nRoughly 13,000 patients will lose access to care and Planned Parenthood will lay off 77 staff.\n\n\"It's inhumane to take away people's health care,\" Jacobson said. \"Folks that have Medi-Cal should be able to see the provider of their choice for primary care.\"\n\nAguiar-Curry called the loss of primary care \"unacceptable and dangerous.\"\n\nSeeking stability as 'financial cliff' still looms\n\nFarther north, Planned Parenthood Mar Monte -- which runs 30 health centers along the California coast, Central Valley and Nevada -- closed five health centers in July shortly after Trump blocked Planned Parenthood's funding.\n\nMar Monte Chief of Staff Andrew Adams said the organization has been working to maintain its financial stability. The closures helped preserve services at the organization's other clinics until the end of the year, but Adams warned that it could hit a \"financial cliff\" in January.\n\n\"We are planning for an environment where there is no federal funding,\" Adams said. \"What that looks like is having to potentially charge patients some amount of money for services we provide.\"\n\nOther Planned Parenthood groups in the state are exploring ways to cut costs and boost revenue while keeping clinics open for patients.\n\nDr. Neda Ashtari, a former Planned Parenthood and Medi-Cal patient, emphasized the importance of ensuring more than 1 million patients continue to have access to cancer screenings and other reproductive health services. When Ashtari was a teenager, her mother died of breast cancer after missing routine scans that could have detected the cancer earlier, she said.\n\n\"It really crystallizes that this preventative care is the difference between life or death,\" Ashtari said.\n\n___\n\nThis story was originally published by CalMatters and distributed through a partnership with The Associated Press.",

    "body": "(Reuters) -Democratic New York Governor Kathy Hochul and California Governor Gavin Newsom said that they would fund reproductive healthcare provider Planned Parenthood amid federal cuts from the Medicaid insurance program.\n\nThe Republican-led Congress' spending bill enacted over the summer denied funds from the joint federal-state program to certain tax-exempt organizations and their affiliates, such as Planned Parenthood, if they continued to provide abortions.\n\nThe move was challenged by Planned Parenthood but ultimately upheld by a federal appeals court last month.\n\nIn light of the cuts, Hochul on Friday said New York would fully cover one year of missing Medicaid funds for Planned Parenthood in the state, providing more than $35 million. Newsom on Thursday said that California would invest more than $140 million to support access to the reproductive health provider.\n\n\"California is a reproductive freedom state, and this latest investment continues to show our belief in protecting access to essential health care in times of distress,\" Newsom said in a statement.\n\nPlanned Parenthood serves more than 200,000 patients each year among 47 health centers in New York and sees more than a million patient visits among more than 100 centers in California, according to the governors.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's July spending bill aimed to \"shut down Planned Parenthood health centers, strip access to essential health care from patients, and make it harder for everyone, everywhere to get an abortion -- even in states where it's legal,\" the group's spokeswoman, Angela Vasquez-Giroux, said.\n\nConservatives have long sought to defund Planned Parenthood because it provides abortions along with other health services such as cancer screenings. U.S. government funding for nearly all abortions has been banned since 1977, so the group uses other funding sources to pay for those procedures.\n\nThe conservative-led U.S. Supreme Court in 2022 overturned the Roe v. Wade ruling that recognized women's constitutional right to abortion. In 2024, it preserved access to the abortion pill mifepristone.\n\n(Reporting by Jasper WardEditing by Peter Graff)",

    "title": "New California Laws Raise The Stakes On Pay Transparency And Reporting",
    "body": "Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights.\n\nCalifornia has long been a national leader in advancing pay equity and wage transparency. From banning salary history inquiries to requiring public pay scale disclosures, the state continues to push employers toward greater accountability. This fall, Governor Gavin Newsom signed two new bills into law, Senate Bill 642 and Senate Bill 464, that expand existing pay transparency and pay data reporting requirements. Together, the bills tighten employer obligations and reinforce the state's commitment to eliminating pay disparities across gender, race, and ethnicity.\n\nCalifornia's approach to pay equity is evolving. With that comes new compliance challenges for employers.\n\nCalifornia's pay transparency law already requires employers with 15 or more employees to include pay scales in job postings and to provide pay ranges upon request to current employees and applicants. Senate Bill 642, effective January 1, 2026, builds on that foundation by clarifying definitions, extending enforcement timeframes, and aligning California's Equal Pay Act with evolving standards of gender inclusivity and compensation fairness.\n\nThe amended law defines \"pay scale\" as a good faith estimate of the salary or hourly wage range that the employer reasonably expects to pay for the position upon hire. The inclusion of \"upon hire\" narrows the range employers may post, requiring that advertised pay scales reflect realistic offers rather than long-term pay progression or aspirational ranges. This change underscores the need for coordination among recruiting, compensation, and compliance teams to ensure that posted ranges match actual hiring practices.\n\nImportantly, the law does not require employers to include non‑salary forms of compensation, such as bonuses, commissions, equity awards, or other benefits, in posted pay ranges. However, these forms of compensation are now explicitly included in the Equal Pay Act's definition of \"wages,\" which broadens the scope of potential liability for unequal pay claims.\n\nExisting law prohibits wage disparities based on race, ethnicity, or \"opposite sex\" for substantially similar work. SB 642 replaces \"opposite sex\" with \"another sex,\" aligning the law with inclusive gender terminology and modern workplace realities. While largely linguistic, this update reflects California's continued effort to ensure that statutory protections keep pace with how employees identify.\n\nPreviously, employees had two years (or three years for willful violations) to file claims under the state's Equal Pay Act. SB 642 extends the limitations period to three years for all violations and allows employees to seek recovery for up to six years of underpayment. This expanded window significantly increases exposure for employers, particularly those with historical pay disparities or incomplete documentation.\n\nThe law also clarifies that a claim accrues when any of the following occur:\n\nSB 642 also codifies the \"pay equity clock,\" clarifying that a cause of action resets with each instance of payment based on an unlawful compensation decision. In other words, the statute of limitations may restart every payday, so long as the pay disparity remains uncorrected.\n\nSince 2021, California has required private employers with 100 or more employees to submit annual pay data reports to the Civil Rights Department. These reports must include employee counts by job category, race, ethnicity, and sex; pay bands; and hours worked. Senate Bill 464 strengthens this framework by expanding job categories, requiring stricter data practices, and removing discretion from enforcement.\n\nThe law phases in two major changes. Beginning in 2026, employers will face mandatory penalties for noncompliance and must store demographic data separately from personnel records. In 2027, employers must adopt a new job categorization structure that more than doubles the number of categories.\n\nBeginning January 1, 2027, the number of job categories employers must report will more than double, from 10 to 23, marking a significant shift away from the EEO-1 style framework. The new structure aligns with the Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) system used by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, and includes detailed occupational classifications, such as separate categories for healthcare practitioners, education, legal occupations, media, and maintenance roles.\n\nThe move to SOC-aligned categories reflects California's intent to generate more meaningful pay equity data by reporting at a finer occupational level.\n\nEmployers and labor contractors must collect and store demographic information, such as race, ethnicity, and sex, separately from personnel records. This provision helps ensure that sensitive data used for reporting is segregated from employment decision-making files, supporting privacy protections and reducing the risk of unintended bias.\n\nPreviously, courts could impose penalties when employers failed to submit pay data reports but retained discretion in enforcement. SB 464 eliminates that discretion. Starting in 2026, courts must impose civil penalties if the Civil Rights Department requests them: $100 per employee for an initial violation and $200 per employee for each subsequent violation. These amounts can quickly escalate. A company with 500 employees that fails to file could face $50,000 to $100,000 in fines.\n\nThe bill also clarifies that if a labor contractor fails to provide data, courts may apportion penalties to the contractor.\n\nThese provisions reinforce the state's intent to treat pay data reporting as a central enforcement tool, not just a regulatory formality. Reports submitted in 2026 (due by May 12, the second Wednesday of May) will be the first subject to these mandatory penalties and data handling requirements.\n\nIn parallel with SB 464's passage, the California Civil Rights Council has voted to form a subcommittee on pay data reporting to review forthcoming regulations. The subcommittee is expected to clarify key terms and address employer requests for implementation guidance. While SB 464 lays the statutory foundation, this regulatory activity may influence how reporting obligations evolve in practice.\n\nWhile SB 642 and SB 464 address different parts of California's pay equity framework, their goals align. One demands proactive transparency at the point of hire, and the other builds retrospective accountability through data collection and enforcement. Both require employers to revisit their internal policies, documentation, and compliance readiness.\n\nFor companies operating in California, that means:\n\nMulti-state employers should pay close attention. California's approach continues to influence legislative trends across the country, especially in jurisdictions looking to advance pay equity through both transparency and enforcement.\n\nCalifornia's latest pay equity laws mark a shift from procedural compliance to strategic accountability in how employers approach compensation. With SB 642 and SB 464, the message is clear: transparency isn't optional, and accountability is here to stay.\n\nEmployers should act now to assess internal systems, close data gaps, and align hiring and compensation practices with California's evolving standards. Waiting until enforcement ramps up may prove costly not just in penalties, but in reputation harm and diminished employee trust.",

Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), against engaging in an \"apparent criminal conspiracy\" to arrest Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents.\n\nDeputy Attorney General Todd Blanche issued the letter to Pelosi, Gov.

    "title": "Why Trump spared San Francisco",
    "body": "It was also a monumentally validating moment for Lurie, a first-term mayor and moderate Democrat whose painstaking effort to avoid provoking Trump ran in contrast to a field of high-profile Democrats who have assailed the president. Unlike the Gavin Newsoms or JB Pritzkers or Brandon Johnsons of the party, Lurie has taken a less confrontational route.\n\nAn heir to the billion-dollar Levi Strauss fortune, he has fewer political imperatives to brawl with Trump -- with the progressive wing of his party out of power in San Francisco and any prospects of running for higher office, which he has downplayed, further out on the horizon. But in Trump's reversal, he delivered a rare victory for Democrats in the minority in Washington and besieged by the GOP in cities across the map.\n\nIn San Francisco on Thursday -- where residents had braced for what many saw as an impending act of federal aggression -- what was left from his armistice with Trump was a sense of temporary relief.\n\nLurie's allies cast Trump's standing down as an affirmation that his more measured approach -- focusing on public safety statistics and avoiding partisan saber rattling -- may have saved San Francisco from a chaotic and dangerous moment. They said it also underscored Lurie's ability to leverage relationships with prominent CEOs who have direct access to Trump. The president said his call with the mayor came after San Francisco tech titans -- including Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Salesforce founder Marc Benioff -- implored him not to move forward.\n\n\"You can't argue with success,\" said Board of Supervisors President Rafael Mandelman, a leader of City Hall's moderate Democratic majority. \"People are second guessing him, but I'm seeing success. The mayor has been walking this tightrope.\"\n\nMandelman said Lurie's team had enlisted prominent tech CEOs to reach out to Trump in recent days, as more than 100 federal agents purportedly amassed at a U.S. Coast Guard base across the Bay. The supervisor said he initially thought the Hail Mary effort had fizzled, until he heard news of Lurie's call with the president.\n\nLurie declined to share many details of the call, instead touting the city's post-pandemic recovery, improving crime rates and his willingness to work with federal authorities to target a fentanyl-addiction crisis that is still ravaging the city's core.\n\n\"Having the military and militarized immigration enforcement in our city will hinder our recovery,\" Lurie told reporters on Thursday.\n\nDan Newman, a veteran consultant and Lurie ally, said the mayor's pragmatic approach and focus on quality-of-life issues is what San Francisco voters wanted last year when they ousted an incumbent mayor in favor of Lurie, a first-time candidate who previously was on the sidelines of Democratic politics.\n\n\"There's no posturing, no strutting -- just getting things done,\" Newman said of the mayor. \"It validates everything about who he is with a leader.\"\n\nEven Democrats far from San Francisco took notice. Austin Beutner, a former schools chief seeking to oust Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass in that city's mayoral election, said, \"If you take care of your own business, it leaves less opportunity for others to assert that they can do a better job of taking care of your business.\"\n\nIt's unclear how long the peace between San Francisco and the White House will last. And some California Democrats, while praising Lurie, rejected the notion the mayor had cracked the code to placating Trump. Newsom's spokesperson, Bob Salladay, congratulated Lurie and said the governor was glad the mayor had defused the situation.\n\nBut Salladay said that would not change the governor's approach. Newsom earlier this year adopted a conciliatory stance toward Trump as he pursued goals like wildfire relief. But the relationship reverted to mutual animosity, inflamed when Trump sent the National Guard to Los Angeles and California sued to block Trump priorities like tariffs.\n\n\"People are obsessed with this idea that if you kiss Trump's ass you'll get what you want,\" Salladay said. \"No one has worked more with Trump than Gavin Newsom -- and yet the president insists on attacking California, attacking the governor, attacking the people of this state for his own aggrandizement.\"\n\nWhile Trump credited tech figures with persuading him to stand down, Newsom has decried Silicon Valley leaders for trying to ingratiate themselves with the White House. On Wednesday, Newsom derided Trump's moves to acquire equity shares in various companies as a form of \"crony capitalism,\" invoking Nvidia and joking about selling knee pads on the \"Patriot\" website he set up to parody the president for executives who were \"bending the knee.\"\n\nThe reprieve for San Francisco was stunning coming from a president who has a history of sparring with California's big-city mayors. Bass is a frequent target. During his first term, Trump often attacked then-Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf, even floating the possibility of prosecuting her after she informed residents of a pending immigration raid.\n\nSchaaf commended Lurie in an interview and said the mayor, who has yet to serve a full year in office, may have benefited from having a fairly clean slate with the president, whereas she had \"an acrimonious relationship\" with Trump before he took office. But Schaaf argued Lurie had effectively defended his city by rebutting Trump's claims about unchecked crime.\n\n\"I wasn't going to let anyone paint an untrue picture of my city,\" Schaaf said. \"He did the same, just more politely.\"\n\nWhile local progressive leaders also cheered Lurie's breakthrough with Trump, anxiety lingered among some of them, who questioned the sincerity of Trump's pledge. Others noted that aggressive enforcement tactics have been underway in the city for months and will likely continue.\n\n\"This approach is just a temporary halt, and that does not mean it's a sustainable approach,\" said Supervisor Connie Chan, a leader of the city's progressives. \"You cannot trust it. I will not and am not.\"\n\nProgressive supervisors responded by proposing the city set aside an additional $3.5 million for immigration legal services to assist those facing deportation. Several said they're skeptical of Lurie's offer to partner with federal agencies on fentanyl operations, which they said could open the door to cooperation with Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\nTrump himself left the door open Thursday to greater federal intervention if he doesn't see enough progress. He suggested the city could address its problems with crime faster with federal agents on the ground.\n\n\"I wish them luck, but we could do it so much faster,\" Trump said during a White House briefing. \"And if it doesn't work out, we'll do it for you very quickly.\"",

    "title": "Why apartments are the next EV frontier",
    "body": "With help from Noah Baustin, Camille von Kaenel, Ben Lefebvre and Mike Lee\n\nFLIP THE SWITCH: California's 6 million renters could hold the key to the state's Trump-battered electric vehicle goals -- and Republicans' EV champion has a plan to reach them.\n\nMike Murphy, a veteran GOP consultant who's advised presidential candidates like John McCain, Jeb Bush and Mitt Romney, told POLITICO in an exclusive interview that EVs for All America -- the nonprofit he launched in 2023 to study partisan divides over the technology -- is lobbying Gov. Gavin Newsom and lawmakers to open the coffers and start installing home chargers at apartments and condos around the state.\n\nThe organization -- which has an advocacy arm backed by automakers (a list Murphy said isn't public) -- is making its first foray into state politics after President Donald Trump's systematic dismantling of EV incentives, including the $7,500 federal tax credit for car buyers, sent shockwaves through the market.\n\n\"After Trump killed the federal EV action, we said, 'California is one-third of all EV sales, so let's get something done at the state level,'\" Murphy said. \"And our research found that multi-family charging is a huge problem.\"\n\nRenters, who are far less likely to own EVs than homeowners, represent a potentially game-changing untapped market in a state where growth for battery-electric and plug-in hybrid cars has stalled in recent years (aside from a recent spike between July and September, as buyers raced to use the federal tax incentive before it expired on Oct. 1).\n\nResearchers say that's because while it's relatively straightforward for homeowners to install a garage or driveway charger, renters may not want to invest in equipment they'll lose if they move -- and landlords are reluctant to spend on upgrades that could potentially go unused.\n\nMurphy's plan would tap revenue from the state's carbon-emissions trading program -- a figure he said would be $100 million annually in an ideal world -- to fund state-run installations and, in turn, let landlords charge a small monthly fee.\n\n\"It's got to be landlord-friendly,\" Murphy said. \"We're going to put it in for free, and you can charge a little money for it. It takes out all the headaches for the apartment building owner.\"\n\nThe concept emerged from a poll of 400 apartment renters and condo owners conducted by David Binder Research last month and shared exclusively with POLITICO, which found that 80 percent of renters reported not having chargers at their buildings, while a similar number said they'd pay up to $50 per month for a parking space with a charger.\n\nMurphy could find willing partners in Assemblymember Lori Wilson and Sen. Dave Cortese -- the respective chairs of their chambers' transportation committees -- who both said last month that apartment charging is among their top priorities when the legislature reconvenes in January. Murphy said he has a meeting scheduled with Wilson in her Bay Area district next month.\n\n\"That's the missing piece,\" Wilson told POLITICO last month. \"There's still nothing like people going home, plugging in their vehicle and waking up in the morning knowing they can drive.\"\n\nBut a looming budget deficit will make any push for new funding more difficult. The state's precarious financial position has already forced Newsom to back away from his commitment to backfill federal tax incentives with a state-run program, and the tussle for cap-and-invest dollars is expected to be fierce.\n\nAnd the fight over how to structure a new state incentive program would likely cause its own political headaches. California already operates a funding program to encourage landlords in disadvantaged communities to build chargers. Murphy argued that program misses the mark, and that the state should be trying to convert renters of all incomes.\n\n\"That would be an evolution of some of the thinking in California, which is kind of tilted toward equity and lower-income people, when the name of the game is how many drivers you convert,\" he said.\n\nAlan Jenn, a UC Davis professor who studies EVs and charging infrastructure, cautioned against a one-size-fits-all program in a complex rental market that ranges from mom-and-pop duplexes to corporate-run mega-apartments. And he said ongoing research is finding that government inefficiency, and not a lack of funding, is the biggest hurdle for landlords who want to tap state resources.\n\n\"It can take so long that they end up giving up,\" he said. \"I think a lot of it is friction in the system. It's not necessarily about whether or not there are incentives.\" -- AN\n\nDid someone forward you this newsletter? Sign up here!\n\nHERE COME THE DRILLS: The California coast may soon be the home of new oil drilling rigs.\n\nThe Trump administration plans to propose opening federal waters off the southern coast of California to drilling, POLITICO's Ben Lefebvre reports. That would be a sharp reversal: Oil production in the Pacific Ocean has declined for decades amid tighter California regulations that make it difficult to transport the oil from federal waters to the state's coastline.\n\nBut even if few companies see a business case for drilling off the California coast, Trump may be pressuring Newsom to take a stand on the fraught energy issue, an industry executive familiar with the expected plan's outline said.\n\n\"There's an interesting dynamic of fighting Gavin Newsom in California,\" this person said. \"Who wouldn't want that?\"\n\nNewsom's office did not reply to multiple requests for comment.\n\nBut environmentalists were quick to express their displeasure with the news.\n\n\"It seems like the trend with the current administration is moving us backward when California and others have been working so hard to move in a direction of renewable and more responsible energy production,\" said Maggie Hall, deputy chief counsel for the Environmental Defense Center.\n\nHer organization has been fighting the possibility of the new drilling ever since the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management opened a request for information for its National Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program in May, according to Hall.\n\nSen. Alex Padilla also presumably foresaw this possibility in April when he introduced a bill that would permanently prohibit new oil and gas leases for offshore drilling off the California coast. The bill remains in committee.\n\nSable Offshore Corp., which is trying to ramp up oil production on a previously mothballed rig off Santa Barbara, asked the Trump administration's National Energy Dominance Council for permitting help in September. -- NB\n\nSPEAKING OF CHARGERS: California is still the nation's leader in building EV charging stations, but other states are starting to pick up their pace -- even against federal headwinds.\n\nCharger companies built 699 fast-charging stations and more than 4,000 individual charging ports between July and September, according to a new report from Paren, an EV charging data platform. That brings the national totals to 12,375 stations with 64,486 ports, Mike Lee writes for POLITICO's E&E News.\n\nCalifornia again led the charge with 108 stations built in Q3, but Texas, New York, Florida and Illinois all saw construction on at least 35 stations finish. Meanwhile, California was one of the few states to see overall use of its stations dip, but that might actually be a good sign.\n\n\"We believe that the reason is that the infrastructure is actually growing faster there in anticipation of new cars coming in the future,\" Paren CEO Florent Breton said. -- ML, AN\n\nA BRANCHING FIGHT: California fire officials are considering making their proposed fire-resistant landscaping rules more flexible after fierce opposition from Southern California.\n\nThe long-delayed requirements to clear flammable material from within five feet of buildings in fire-prone areas could transform neighborhoods from inside out. But -- surprise -- not everyone wants to get rid of their trees, especially in Southern California, where the Los Angeles city council formally opposed the rules this month out of concern it would harm local biodiversity and shade trees.\n\nIn a new draft Thursday, the Board of Forestry and Fire Protection proposed exempting well-maintained plants and trees protected under local ordinances from the rules.\n\nTree-loving Angelenos told the board in a workshop on Thursday they were pleased with the proposed changes; but insurance industry reps urged the board to stick with the more strict version instead to make homes more insurable.\n\nNewsom has ordered the Board to finalize the rules by the end of the year. -- CvK\n\nMYSTERY NO MORE: Fuel companies have been charging Californians a mysterious gasoline surcharge for the past decade, costing residents $59 billion.\n\nThat's according to a report released Thursday by the California Division of Petroleum Market Oversight. While California does have unique taxes, fees and environmental programs that add to the cost of gasoline, prices in the Golden State are significantly higher than can be explained by those add-ons, the agency found.\n\nBetween 2015 and 2024, that surcharge averaged $0.41 per gallon.\n\n\"This surcharge is not transparent, and to the extent it represents increased profit margins, it offers no direct public benefit,\" the agency wrote.\n\nThe report found that the surcharge was even higher at the state's major branded gas stations: Chevron, Shell, ExxonMobil and 76. The overall surcharge averaged $0.75 per gallon from February 2015 through August 2025. Unbranded stations had a $0.37-per-gallon surcharge.\n\nWhile the agency did not present a conclusive explanation for the surcharge, it said that one potential cause is the increasing market concentration in the state. In California, four companies control 90 percent of in-state refining capacity. In the rest of the U.S., that figure is 48 percent. -- NB\n\n-- Google agreed to buy a majority of the power from a proposed gas-fired power plant that plans to capture 90 percent of its carbon -- the first commercial-scale project of its kind.\n\n-- Hunters will soon be allowed to kill invasive, territorial swans that have attacked people and disrupted other migratory birds.\n\n-- The California Chamber of Commerce has filed a ballot initiative to overhaul the California Environmental Quality Act.\n\nCALIFORNIA POLICY IS ALWAYS CHANGING: Know your next move.

    "title": "CBS News poll on whether California's voters want Newsom, Harris to run for president",
    "body": "As the state draws national attention in part because of Proposition 50 and redistricting, Californians also weigh in on what they think the state more generally can -- and can't -- show the nation, and on the potential prospects of some of its leading political figures.\n\nA large number of Californians in his own Democratic Party say Gov. Gavin Newsom should run for president in 2028, but among California's voters overall, that view is more split.\n\n(Nationally, of course, any entrant on the Democratic side would first need to appeal to the party's rank-and-file in the primaries across many states. The perspective of home-state voters on an elected official, either in opinions or in state race results, is often taken as a view from the voters who've presumably gotten to know their work more closely over the years.)\n\nNewsom's overall approval rating as governor is positive and a little higher than the percentage who want him to run in 2028.\n\nGiven that speculation, California voters tend to think Newsom right now is paying attention to both national and state issues -- though fewer feel he is paying mind to their local issues.\n\nBy comparison, more California Democrats say Newsom should run in 2028 than say that of former Vice President Kamala Harris, who previously represented California in the Senate.\n\nFewer than a third of the state's voters -- and just under half of California Democrats -- think she should run. She won her home state when she ran in 2024.\n\nMost independents don't think Newsom or Harris should run, but by comparison, they are much more likely to think Newsom should.\n\nAs Californians are thinking about Prop 50 in national terms, we also wanted to know how they saw the state, relative to the nation on other matters, too.\n\nCalifornians think the state sets a good example for the rest of the U.S. on technology and innovation, on culture, and for a slight majority, on environmental policy.\n\nBut few think it sets a good example on housing policy (most California voters also describe the cost of living in the state more generally as unmanageable), on tax policy, on economic policy or on its politics.\n\nPerhaps related, most Californians -- including many with higher incomes -- describe the cost of living in the state as either somewhat or very unmanageable.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, California's gubernatorial race will take place next year, with the primary also still many months off to establish the top two vote getters for the November 2026 general election.\n\nAs with any contest so distant, voters can and do consider multiple candidates or potential entrants, and long before having to make a single choice. That is reflected here. For many voters, they have not heard enough about many.\n\nIn all, current Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla of California is the most considered name (though he's not a candidate, there are reports he may be considering entering the race) and particularly so among Democrats. He's also won statewide office before and by comparison is best known to voters.\n\nFormer Rep. Katie Porter remains slightly more considered than other Democrats besides Padilla, but also has a somewhat higher number saying she's not being considered.\n\nAlso as a part of the early process, there is plenty of cross-consideration. Most of the voters considering Porter are also considering Padilla, and vice versa. Democratic voters are often considering a number of the Democrats running.\n\nThe overall number who haven't heard enough, and who are cross-considering, only emphasizes the point that in the minds of voters that this next-year contest is only just beginning to take shape.\n\nIn a state where voters of one party outnumber the other by such a wide margin, one dynamic to watch is who is seen as trying to earn votes or as taking them for granted. Neither party does especially well overall, with Democrats faring a little better than Republicans on being seen as trying to earn votes, but also worse on perceptions of taking votes for granted. A lot of independents are skeptical of both parties, with only about a quarter of them feeling that California's Democrats or its Republicans try to earn their votes.",

    "title": "Cash-Strapped California Spends $140 Million to Shore Up Planned Parenthood Abortion Clinics",
    "body": "California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) announced Thursday that the cash-strapped state will be spending -- \"investing\" -- $140 million on Planned Parenthood abortion clinics to compensate for lost federal spending.\n\nUnder the Hyde Amendment, federal dollars cannot be used to fund abortions. However, Planned Parenthood had received federal funding for other purposes -- money critics said was \"fungible.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump cut off all federal funding to Planned Parenthood under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act signed earlier this year. Planned Parenthood has failed, thus far, to reinstate funding through the courts.\n\nSo California, under Newsom's vociferously pro-abortion administration, is stepping in to pay the bills.\n\nNewsom said in a press statement on Thursday: \"California is a reproductive freedom state, and this latest investment continues to show our belief in protecting access to essential health care in times of distress. Trump's efforts to defund Planned Parenthood put all our communities at risk as people seek basic health care from these community providers.\"\n\nHis office added:\n\nAs President Trump continues to attack California, including defunding Planned Parenthood health centers nationwide in his Big Beautiful Betrayal (HR-1), Governor Gavin Newsom today announced investments of over $140 million in state funding to support these critical health care centers and access points to life-saving care and treatment for millions of Californians.\n\n...\n\nCalifornia's Planned Parenthood affiliates operate more than 100 health centers across the Golden State, providing more than a million patient visits a year to Californians in search of basic health care needs.\n\nIn 2026, Governor Newsom and legislative leaders intend to identify additional resources so Planned Parenthood health centers can continue to provide critical services to Californians. California is committed to standing with Planned Parenthood Affiliates of California through ongoing political attacks by President Trump's Administration and Republicans in Congress.\n\nCalifornia has suffered budget deficits for the past two years, after squandering record budget surpluses. The most recent budget deficit was $12 billion, leading state legislators to cut spending on several programs.\n\nBut Newsom found $140 million for Planned Parenthood -- as well as $251 million for the special election he is holding that he hopes will ratify a gerrymandered congressional map Democrats drew behind closed doors.",

Gavin Newsom (D) announced that he's going to send a very pragmatic gift to a few noteworthy loyalists of President Donald Trump, and it's likely something that a Targaryen (\"Game of Thrones\") would unironically give to everyone they know: knee pads.\n\n\"COMING SOON -- NEW KNEE PADS FOR ALL CEO's, UNIVERSITIES, AND GOP BENDING THE KNEE TO DONALD TRUMP,\" Newsom tweeted Wednesday.\n\nHe added: \"YOUR KNEES LOOK VERY SORE FROM ALL YOUR GROVELING. THEY WILL EVEN BE SIGNED BY YOUR DEAR LEADER SINCE YOU LOVE HIM SO MUCH! YOU ARE WELCOME!!!!\"\n\nAlong with Newsom's tweet was a snippet of his appearance at the California Economic Summit in Stockton on Wednesday, where he expanded on his snarky sporting gear agenda, saying that he intends to send a pair to the University of Virginia, the latest institution to reach a settlement with the Justice Department over its diversity, equity, and inclusion policies. It follows schools like Columbia University and Brown University, which have also buckled to the Trump administration's demands to restore their funding.\n\nIn his clip, Newsom criticized \"all the CEOs, media companies, law firms and universities\" for \"bending a knee\" to the Trump administration.\n\n\"This guy is ...rewriting history,\" Newsom said of Trump on Wednesday. \"Putting us back to a pre-1960s world, censoring historic facts. Wake up, everybody.\"\n\nNewsom also said the knee pads would be available on his satirical \"Patriot\" site, which he set up earlier this year to mock Trump's fundraising operation.\n\nMAGA makes'your mom'jokes.\n\nYour SupportFuelsOur Mission\n\nYour SupportFuelsOur Mission\n\nWe make headlines.\n\nSerious questions deserve better than middle school humor.\n\nWe remain committed to providing you with the unflinching, fact-based journalism everyone deserves.\n\nThank you again for your support along the way.

    "body": "The San Francisco Chronicle, citing an anonymous source with knowledge of the operation, reported Wednesday that more than 100 CBP and other federal agents would arrive this week. San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie and California Governor Gavin Newsom immediately condemned the move. The two Democrats said the surge is meant to provoke violent protests.\n\nCBP did not immediately respond Wednesday to a request for comment from The Associated Press. A statement provided to media by the Coast Guard said that \"through a whole of government approach, we are leveraging our unique authorities and capabilities to detect, deter, and interdict illegal aliens, narco-terrorists, and individuals intent on terrorism or other hostile activity before they reach our border.\"\n\nSoon after the deployment was first reported Wednesday, Lurie livestreamed a nine-minute statement from City Hall, flanked by other elected officials, and cautioned against giving federal officials working from \"a playbook\" any excuse to crack down. President Donald Trump has repeatedly said he plans to deploy National Guard troops to the city to quell crime, but his administration hasn't offered a timeline for doing so.\n\n\"In cities across the country, masked immigration officials are deployed to use aggressive enforcement tactics that instill fear so people don't feel safe going about their daily lives,\" Lurie said. \"These tactics are designed to incite backlash, chaos and violence, which are then used as an excuse to deploy military personnel.\"\n\nTrump has deployed the Guard to Washington, D.C., and Memphis, Tennessee, to help fight what he says is rampant crime. Los Angeles was the first city where Trump deployed the Guard, arguing it was necessary to protect federal buildings and federal agents as protesters fought back against mass immigration arrests.\n\nHe has also said they are needed in Chicago and Portland, Oregon, though lawsuits from Democratic officials in both cities have so far blocked troops from going out on city streets.\n\nTrump recently renewed his musings about sending the Guard to San Francisco, telling Fox News on Sunday the city \"was truly one of the great cities of the world\" before it went \"wrong\" and \"woke.\"\n\nHis assertions of out-of-control crime in the city of roughly 830,000 have baffled local and state leaders, who point to statistics showing that many crimes are at record lows.\n\nNewsom's administration said it would push back on any deployment, as it did when Trump first ordered the Guard into Los Angeles against the governor's wishes. California Attorney General Rob Bonta vowed to \"be in court within hours, if not minutes,\" if there is a federal deployment. San Francisco City Attorney David Chiu promised the same.\n\nCoast Guard Island is an artificial island formed in 1913, and the Coast Guard first established a base there in 1926. The island is owned by the federal government and is not open to the general public, so escorts or specific government ID cards are required for visitors. The Coast Guard is part of the US Department of Homeland Security, which also houses ICE.\n\n___",

It would be hilarious if he did. It would be one of the funniest things of all time if an 82-year-old man steps into the office of governor of California,\" Rogan continued.\n\nHe then launched into an impression of the president, saying: \"'We're gonna fix everything. You've got a problem with water, I know how to get the water.' It would be f -- ing hilarious.\"\n\nEarlier in the show, Rogan said he recently spoke with a friend who is fleeing Los Angeles because he can't stand the state's politics anymore.\n\n\"It's like everybody went crazy. It's like there's something that happened because of the pandemic and the Black Lives Matter protests and the riots and all the chaos,\" Rogan said.\n\n\"Whatever the temperature of society was, it hit societal global warming where it's like - it's time to investigate Greenland. It's time to move north, like this is a bad climate now. This sucks.\"\n\nKasin chimed in to agree, saying the weather is so beautiful in California that it feels like \"paradise\" when you step out of the airport - but politicians like Newsom \"f -- ed it up so bad that people will literally pack up and leave paradise.\"\n\nIt's not the first time Rogan has blasted the lefty state and its leadership. He previously called Newsom a \"bulls-t artist\" who \"ruined\" California.\n\nNewsom responded earlier this month by daring \"that son of a bitch\" Rogan to \"invite\" him onto an episode of his podcast.\n\nThe next California gubernatorial election is in 2026. Trump would not be able to run for the seat until the 2030 election, when he would be 84.",

And so put aside morality. What's the smart thing for Democrats to do? It's not obvious to me that sinking to the moral level of MAGA is the right answer here. It seems to me if people want to turn the page on this moment, they're going to want to turn the page in a little the way they turn the page. And this is not a great example of Jimmy Carter after Watergate. They're going to want to say: I want somebody so clean, somebody who respects government, somebody who plays by the rules, who will uphold the norms that I remember. And it seems to me that's actually a smarter play for Democrats. Now, I understand the temptation. You can't hand away the House in 2026. So I understand the temptation.

    "body": "California Governor Gavin Newsom (D) told residents to \"remain peaceful\" as President Donald Trump sends hundreds of federal law enforcement officials to San Francisco to assist with immigration and other issues.\n\nNewsom, who has ramped up his incendiary rhetoric against the Trump administration even in the wake of the assassination last month of Charlie Kirk, told constituents to avoid responding to Trump with violence.\n\nNewsom targeted Trump aide Stephen Miller, a Californian who is a staunch opponent of illegal immigration.\n\nIn a separate posting, Newsom blamed Trump for creating \"conditions for anxiety\" as a pretext for \"sending in the [National] Guard.\" He said that Trump's tactics were \"right out of the dictator's handbook.\" Again, he did so without apparent concern that he was stoking that violence by calling Trump a \"dictator,\" especially after Trump survived two assassination attempts, including one in which he was shot in the head, last year.\n\nSan Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie has also rejected Trump's help with law enforcement, though a study by the city revealed this week that the city's streets are becoming dirtier, despite the newly-installed mayor's reforms.\n\nNewsom and his party have lost several court challenges to Trump's power to send the National Guard to cities where rioters have targeted Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and federal institutions.\n\nDemocrat megadonor Marc Benioff, the CEO of San Francisco-based Salesforce, backed Trump's suggestion of sending in the National Guard before coming under criticism from fellow Democrats and then recanting.\n\nJoel B.

    "body": "Less than two weeks out of California's special election, Barack Obama praised Gov. Gavin Newsom's (D) redistricting campaign to push back against what the former president described as a \"brazen\" effort by Republicans to give their party an edge ahead of next year's midterm elections.\n\nSpeaking to volunteers on a call hosted by Newsom on Wednesday, Obama said President Donald Trump and his administration have made clear they are saying they \"want to change the rules of the game midstream in order to insulate ourselves from the people's judgment.\"\n\n\"They want to tinker around with it to see if they can give themselves an advantage. And it's brazen,\" Obama said. \"They're not pretending that there's some other rationale to it. They're simply doing it because they think they can.\"\n\nIf approved, Newsom's proposal -- also known as Proposition 50 -- would target five GOP-held seats in the Golden State, counteracting moves by Texas, North Carolina and other Republican-led states to redraw their congressional maps mid-decade in an effort to ensure their party maintains control of the U.S. House in the midterms.\n\nObama added that the passage of Proposition 50 would have \"critical implications\" beyond California.\n\n\"The essence of Prop 50 is to say that if you are going to play that game, then we are going to try to counteract that abuse of the system, and as a consequence of California's actions, we have a chance, at least, to create a level playing field in the upcoming midterm elections,\" he said.\n\n\"There's a broader principle at stake that has to do with whether or not our democracy can be manipulated by those who are already in power to entrench themselves further, or whether we're going to have a system that allows the people to decide who's going to represent them,\" he continued.\n\nObama appeared in an ad released last week to promote Newsom's proposal, warning that \"Democracy is on the ballot Nov. 4.\"\n\nNewsom thanked Obama for joining the effort.\n\n\"We appreciate seeing you up on our screens every hour of every day as our closing messenger on this campaign,\" Newsom said.\n\n\"I hope it's dawning on everybody just how precious this moment is,\" the governor continued.",

Gavin Newsom on Wednesday threatened to sue the Trump administration if National Guard troops are sent to San Francisco.\n\n\"Send troops to San Francisco and we will sue you, @realDonaldTrump,\" Newsom wrote on X.\n\n\"We're going to be fierce, we're going to be focused in terms of our response. Quite literally, this is the lawsuit that I will file within a nanosecond of any effort to send the military to one of America's great cities, San Francisco,\" he said at a news conference while raising a document.\n\nThe governor said California officials \"will push back with clarity and conviction,\" adding that they will \"continue to win in court.\"\n\nTRUMP'S IMPENDING SAN FRANCISCO CRACKDOWN SPARKS BACKLASH FROM NEWSOM, MAYOR\n\nThis comes after President Donald Trump told Fox News' Maria Bartiromo that the National Guard is headed to San Francisco next, after it was already deployed to various U.S. cities, including Los Angeles, Chicago and Washington, D.C., to help reduce crime, support federal immigration enforcement and respond to protests.\n\n\"We're going to go to San Francisco,\" Trump said on Sunday. \"The difference is, I think they want us in San Francisco. San Francisco was truly one of the great cities of the world, and then 15 years ago, it went wrong. It went woke.\"\n\nThe administration is also deploying 100 agents from Customs and Border Protection and from Coast Guard Base Alameda to San Francisco, according to the San Francisco Chronicle.\n\nNewsom also vowed on Tuesday that California would challenge the federal government in court if it deployed troops to San Francisco.\n\nNEWSOM SUES TRUMP ADMINISTRATION OVER CALIFORNIA NATIONAL GUARD DEPLOYMENT ORDER TO OREGON\n\n\"We're a nation of laws and accountability -- not a nation that turns a blind eye to abuse of power,\" he said in a statement. \"Donald Trump, himself a convicted felon who pardoned felons convicted of assaulting federal law enforcement officers, is misleading the public with his false narrative that America, and especially California, is some lawless wasteland.\"\n\n\"But California is proving him wrong -- in the courts and on the facts,\" the governor continued. \"We don't bow to kings, and we're standing up to this wannabe tyrant. The notion that the federal government can deploy troops into our cities with no justification grounded in reality, no oversight, no accountability, no respect for state sovereignty -- it's a direct assault on the rule of law. We're drawing a line: California will always defend the Constitution, our people, and our values from authoritarian overreach.\"\n\nNewsom has touted San Francisco's drop in homicides, and the city's mayor, Democrat Daniel Lurie, affirmed that the city is safe.\n\n\"We got this in San Francisco,\" the mayor told The Associated Press last week.\n\nLurie said on Monday that San Francisco would welcome more federal help to crack down on drug dealers and drug markets but that he opposed the deployment of the National Guard.\n\n\"The National Guard does not have the authority to arrest drug dealers -- and sending them to San Francisco will do nothing to get fentanyl off the streets or make our city safer,\" he told The Associated Press.\n\nCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nCalifornia officials sued the administration over the summer when it sent the National Guard and Marines to Los Angeles to gain control over anti-ICE protests.\n\n\"California has seen enough. President Trump and Stephen Miller's authoritarian playbook is coming for another of our cities, and violence and vandalism are exactly what they're looking for to invoke chaos. Help keep yourself and your communities safe. Remain peaceful,\" Newsom wrote Wednesday on X.",

He sends out border patrol. He sends out ICE,\" Newsom said in a video post on X on Wednesday. \"[He] creates anxiety and fear in the community so that he can lay claim to solving for that by sending in the Guard in the first place. This is no different than the arsonist putting out the fire.\"\n\nThe administration's targeting of the city follows numerous statements Trump has made claiming that San Francisco is crime-ridden and too \"woke\" even as its violent crime rates have seen major declines.\n\n\"I think they want us in San Francisco. San Francisco was truly one of the great cities of the world, and then 15 years ago, it went wrong, it went woke,\" Trump said in a Fox News interview on Sunday while discussing the deployment of the National Guard.\n\nLocal leaders, meanwhile, have stressed that troops aren't needed and emphasized that the National Guard isn't equipped to address issues like a drug crisis.\n\nA DHS spokesperson claimed that federal agents would be targeting the \"worst of the worst\" as part of enforcement efforts, even though data shows that many of the immigrants detained by the administration have no criminal record.\n\nSan Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie, meanwhile, emphasized that the presence of federal agents would only spur anxiety and fear.",

    "body": "The president shared an artificial intelligence-generated video Saturday that showed him dumping feces on American protesters.\n\nFox News host Jesse Watters on Wednesday appeared genuinely confused about the negative reaction to the artificial intelligence-generated video President Donald Trump shared over the weekend, which showed him bombing \"No Kings\" protesters with feces.\n\n\"Trump's a memelord!\" Watters exclaimed loudly during a discussion on \"The Five.\"\n\nWatters went on to argue that Democrats are being hypocritical by condemning the bizarre video, as many have cheered Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-Calif.) for his own social media use -- except Newsom hasn't crapped on the American people in a video.\n\n\"He's strafing feces over everybody, and Democrats are like, 'Ahhhh!'\" Watters said Wednesday. \"Wasn't it like a day ago, they were like, 'We need to up our social media game?' And they were like, 'Gavin's the man! He's crushing it on social media.'\"\n\nWatters slammed MSNBC host Jen Psaki earlier in the show for commenting on Vice President JD Vance's marriage, and criticized actor Jeff Daniels for condemning the Trump video and singing a protest song on television in support of the \"No Kings\" demonstrations.\n\n\"And then Trump puts [House Minority Leader] Hakeem [Jeffries] in a sombrero and they cry,\" said Watters. \"He puts a funny thing out that breaks the internet and they complain. They bring out a 70-year-old actor to play guitar. Think about how that looks.\"\n\nHe continued, \"It doesn't look good, and they are mad that he is having fun.\"\n\nBefore stating as if everyone should know, accept or understand that the president is a \"memelord\" (or someone with an edgy image at the ready for any given situation online), the right-wing pundit praised Trump for his supposedly historic presidency.\n\n\"This guy is modernizing the country!\" Watters said Wednesday.\n\n\"AI,\" he continued. \"We're building nuclear power plants. Bitcoin. He is rewiring world trade. We have to go into this century with the full force of American ingenuity. And if it means a big, beautiful ballroom, if it means a grand arch in the middle of D.C., that's a good thing!\"\n\nTrump has indeed spent much of his second term renovating the White House ballroom and overseeing preliminary plans to construct a new triumphal arch in the nation's capital. How these projects will improve the lives of the American people at large remains unclear.",

    "body": "Radical California Gov. Gavin Newsom has been rocked by a poll of 2028 Democrat presidential hopefuls that shows he is now losing to former Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nA Noble Predictive Insights poll conducted over the first week of October found that Newsom is trailing Harris for the 2028 Democrat nomination among Democrats and independents, Newsweek reported.\n\nThis poll shows that Newsom's assumption that he is the front runner is not exactly a foregone conclusion. The poll placed Harris at 33 percent among Democrats and 27 percent with independents. But Newsom was behind 13 percent among Democrats and back three percent with independents.\n\nOther candidates in the poll include New York Democrat Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who ranked third with a mere eight percent, followed by former Biden Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg at seven percent support.\n\nThe poll might show the beginning of erosion in Newom's commanding position as Democrat frontrunner, after a poll in August found he led the field with 25 percent to Harris's 19 percent, Politico reported at the time.\n\nNewsom has positioned himself as the obvious Democrat front runner and has launched a major social media trolling campaign to attack Trump and Republicans with lowbrow memes, self-aggrandizing boasts, and name calling with accusations that Trump and Republicans are \"fascists.\"\n\nIn September, for instance, he spent an entire day trying to defend his incendiary claim that White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller is a \"fascist.\"\n\nNewsom decided to call Miller a \"fascist\" just days after the same accusation was carved into the bullet casings apparently used in the assassination Charlie Kirk. He had also called Miller, who is Jewish, \"SS\" -- a reference to the Nazis who led the Holocaust.",

    "body": "Gov. Newsom says the deployment is deliberately designed to create chaos so that the president can then send in the National Guard.\n\nThe Trump administration is sending federal agents to San Francisco following weeks of threats from the president to deploy the National Guard to the Bay Area.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom released a statement on X confirming and criticizing the agents' upcoming arrival. He called deployment a \"page right out of the dictator's handbook\" intended to create the conditions of unrest necessary to then send in the National Guard.\n\n\"He sends out masked men, he sends out Border Patrol, he sends out ICE, he creates anxiety and fear in the community so that he can lay claim to solving that by sending in the [National] Guard,\" said Newsom. \"This is no different than the arsonist putting out the fire.\"\n\nAround 100 federal agents, including members of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, are en route to the U.S. Coast Guard's Alameda base, according to reporting from the San Francisco Chronicle. The Coast Guard and DHS did not immediately respond to The Times' request for comment.\n\nTrump has suggested for weeks that San Francisco is next on his list for National Guard deployment, after the administration sent troops to Los Angeles and Chicago and is battling in court to send them to Portland, Ore.\n\nOn Sunday, Trump told Fox News, \"We're going to San Francisco and we'll make it great. It'll be great again.\"\n\nTrump has suggested that the role of the National Guard in San Francisco would be to address crime rates. However, the National Guard is generally not allowed to perform domestic law enforcement duties when federalized by the president.\n\nIn September, he said that cities with Democratic political leadership such as San Francisco, Chicago and Los Angeles \"are very unsafe places and we are going to straighten them out.\"\n\nTrump said he told Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth that \"we should use some of these dangerous cities as training for our military, our national guard.\"\n\nNewsom urged Californians to remain peaceful in the face of the arrival of federal agents.\n\n\"President Trump and [White House Deputy Chief of Staff] Stephen Miller's authoritarian playbook is coming for another of our cities, and violence and vandalism are exactly what they're looking for to invoke chaos,\" said Newsom on X.\n\nThe sending of federal agents to San Francisco comes as the Trump administration continues to crack down on immigration across the nation in an attempt to carry out what the president has proclaimed is the largest deportation effort in U.S. history.",

    "title": "Schwarzenegger needs to step it up if he's going to defeat Prop. 50",
    "body": "After Governor Gavin Newsom pledged to complete his passion project of destroying California by tearing up the Golden State's independently drawn congressional district lines, in favor of a heavily gerrymandered map meant to benefit congressional Democrats -- AKA Proposition 50 -- former California Governator Arnold Schwarzenegger vowed to campaign up and down the state against Newsom's doctored-up map.\n\nAnd unlike his marriage vows, Arnold seems determined to keep this one.\n\nSchwarzenegger -- who championed Proposition 11 in 2008, which created the California Citizens Redistricting Commission to draw state legislative boundaries, and Proposition 20, in 2010, which added the state's congressional districts to the commission's duties -- is commonly described as \"the father of independent redistricting.\" Should Prop. 50 happen to pass, Arnold's magnificent legacy of voting reform will have been destroyed by Newsom.\n\nIf the independent redistricting committee gets wiped out, then Arnold might best be remembered for \"Jingle All the Way.\" Try explaining that to your grandkids next Christmas. Go ahead, I dare you.\n\nIn September, Schwarzenegger gave an exclusive interview to CNN's Elex Michaelson where he said that Democrats' plan to redistrict California's congressional districts is a \"scam\" and \"a big mistake.\"\n\n\"Two wrongs don't make a right,\" he said.\n\nWhen asked if California Democrats will ever want to go back to the current, nonpartisan system, Schwarzenegger answered, \"There's no such thing with politicians and temporary. Have you ever seen a tax that stopped? It's permanent.\"\n\nHe went on to urge voters to \"vote no on Proposition 50.\"\n\nThen, this weekend on HBO's \"Real Time with Bill Maher,\" Schwarzenegger declared, \"I think that Prop. 50 is a big scam, and the reason why I'm saying that is because it says that we should fight [President] Trump because he's a threat to democracy...But in the meantime, they want to go and tear up the Constitution in California, get rid of the independent commission that draws the district lines and take the power away from the people and give it back to the politicians.\"\n\nHe then went on to say, \"I'm a Republican, but I'm not a Republican hack. I'm not a political hack. I don't serve the party...I always serve the people, the people are first, we cannot undo something and rip away the power that the people in California have and give it back to the politicians. We fought there for too long.\"\n\nAnd just in case all of that was too subtle for you, Schwarzenegger also posted a photo of himself wearing a T-shirt that read \"F* the politicians. Terminate Gerrymandering.\"\n\nI asked Jim Lacy, author of \"Taxifornia\" and an official in the Reagan Administration, how much of a punch Schwarzenegger still packs in California politics. He told me, \"He [Schwarzenegger] does have caché, and I've actually done some polling on this myself. He does have caché, but it's not enough cache to overturn the Newsom-versus-Trump projection. So, what the Democrats want to do is make it Newsom versus Trump. If they make it about Newsom versus Trump, they're going to win, because Trump's favorables are about 30, 35 percent. They don't really get much higher than that. Newsom, even though he can be greatly criticized, is closer to 50 percent. So, in thinking about how you defeat Prop 50, you think, 'well, can you bring in someone to counter, and not make it Newsom versus Trump, make it Newsom versus Schwarzenegger.' If you make it Newsom versus Schwarzenegger, it improves the 'no' side, but it doesn't lift it over the top, according to the polling that I've not only seen, but I've done. It brings it to within four to five percent.\"\n\nLacy went on to say that what is really needed \"is an injection of very, very heavy advertising that demonstrates the corruption of the process. That demonstrates that it was not transparent...people like the idea of the independent nonpartisan commission.\"\n\nIn other words, it's going to cost a lot of money to draw attention to the problem of money in politics.\n\nAs of October 16, 2025, the \"Yes\" side has raised $136.4 million, and the \"No\" side is far behind with $79.2 million.\n\nIf Schwarzenegger really wants to defeat Prop. 50, he's going to need to get much louder between now and Election Day. Otherwise, he'll be known as the taller unfunny guy in \"Twins,\" and Gavin Newsom will be playing the lead in the remake of \"True Lies.\"",

    "title": "Californians can now shoot swans year-round without a license",
    "body": "Amendment to state code aims to reduce numbers of non-native mute swans\n\nThe picturesque \"wedding swan\" can now be legally shot in California year-round, without a license.\n\nUnder a bill signed into law this month by Gov. Gavin Newsom, the mute swan has been added to the list of nongame birds that can \"taken or possessed at any time.\" Assembly Bill 764, by Jeff Gonzalez, R-Coachella, takes effect Jan. 1, 2026, and expires after five years.\n\nThe intent is to reduce the population of the non-native mute swan, a large, voracious and territorial bird that competes for resources with native waterfowl and other wetland species. Most of them are in the Suisun Marsh, at the east edge of the Bay Area.\n\nNative to Europe and Asia, these are the birds most people picture when they hear \"swan\" -- large, white, with curved necks and bright orange beaks. They were brought to the United States as pets or largely aesthetic additions to gardens and parks, and now have taken up residence in the wild.\n\nWeighing in at 25 to 30 pounds, they are very aggressive and have been known to inflict serious injuries on humans and pets. The mute swan is a formidable rival to California's most common native swan, the much smaller tundra swan, which is also differentiated by its straight neck and black beak.\n\nSince 2008, California has required a permit for importing or keeping mute swans, but the wild population has still exploded. A CalMatters report citing state wildlife researchers' data said the count grew from 1,150 in 2022 to more than 12,000 in the spring of this year.\n\nWith the passage of AB 764, the mute swan joins the starling and the English sparrow as bird species that can be shot at any time. (Some mammals are also on the list, including coyotes, skunks and opossums.) No license is required if the hunter is on private land, either their own or with permission. Those who kill a mute swan are encouraged to report it to the California Department of Fish and Wildlife so the agency can keep tabs on invasive species.\n\nDespite the nongame classification, there's nothing stopping a hunter from eating a mute swan. It's a lean, dark meat, generally described as no more than mildly gamy. Hunters' online discussions suggest it would take at least six hours to slow-roast an entire bird; given the difficulty of plucking it, cooks are advised to skin it instead. An easier tactic than roasting would be to cut it into pieces and prepare it as you would duck or goose -- cutlets, stir-fry, ground-meat burgers.",

    "title": "Newsom to deploy National Guard after millions at risk of delayed food assistance in shutdown",
    "body": "The ongoing federal government shutdown will likely delay food benefits for millions of Californians -- prompting Gov. Gavin Newsom to set aside $80 million in state support and deploy the California National Guard to assist food banks.\n\nThe governor unveiled the move Wednesday, days after the California Department of Social Services began notifying counties to prepare for the possibility that federally funded food benefits, known as CalFresh in California, could be disrupted.\n\n\"The Republican Government Shutdown is about to delay food benefits for MILLIONS of California families,\" Newsom posted on X, formerly Twitter. \"I am deploying the National Guard on a humanitarian mission to support CA's food banks. Donald Trump is using millions of Americans as political pawns. It's disgusting.\"\n\nWithout federal intervention or the shutdown ending by Thursday, about 5.5 million low-income Californians enrolled in the program would likely not receive assistance for November -- including nearly 3.5 million children and senior citizens.\n\nCalifornia issues about $1.1 billion in CalFresh benefits every month. Though benefits for October have already been distributed, those who applied to the program between Oct. 16 through Oct. 31 would not receive assistance for the second half of the month, as well as November.\n\nRecipients of California's separate food benefits program for eligible noncitizens who can't receive federal aid, known as the California Food Assistance Program, should also expect delays.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture, Food and Nutrition Service, which oversees the federal benefit program, did not respond to a request for comment. Instead, it sent a copy of a memo it issued to state agencies on Oct. 10, notifying them of insufficient funds for November.\n\nLast week, U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins posted on social media that the lack of appropriated funds was due to Democrats \"putting free health care for illegal aliens and their political agenda ahead of food security for American families.\"\n\nRollins is referring to Republicans' claims that Democratic congressional leaders are responsible for the shutdown because they want free health coverage for immigrants without legal status. Democrats are calling for the rollback of Medicaid cuts included in Trump's spending bill, and the extension of subsidies used by most Affordable Care Act enrollees.\n\nIn 2023, nearly a quarter of California households experienced some food insecurity, according to the Public Policy Institute of California. In San Diego County -- which has the highest military population in the state -- local food banks are adding pop-up food banks due to the shutdown to help combat food insecurity among the county's armed service members and federal employees.",

    "body": "CHICAGO -- CHICAGO (AP) -- President Donald Trump's attempts to deploy the military in Democratic-led cities -- over the objections of mayors and governors -- have brought a head-spinning array of court challenges and overlapping rulings.\n\nAs the U.S. Supreme Court ponders whether to clear the way for the National Guard in Chicago, a federal appeals court is hearing arguments in California Gov. Gavin Newsom's challenge to the deployment of troops in Los Angeles. Guard troops could also soon be on the ground in Portland, Oregon, pending legal developments there.\n\nHere's what to know about legal efforts to block or deploy the National Guard in various cities.\n\nA federal judge in Chicago already blocked deployment of Guard troops to the Chicago area for two weeks. On Wednesday, Judge April Perry agreed to extend that order by 30 days. But she said each party could discuss the extension further before meeting again at 3 p.m. local time, noting they would not be able to issue another one.\n\nStill, anything she does could be moot if the U.S. Supreme Court rules in the meantime.\n\nAttorneys representing the Trump administration said in court filings Tuesday that they would agree to possibly extend the block on deployment for 30 days. However, they are continuing to ask the U.S. Supreme Court to intervene. The Trump administration is pressing for an emergency order that would let Guard troops be deployed.\n\n\"Every day this improper TRO remains in effect imposes grievous and irreparable harm on the Executive,\" Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in a Supreme Court filing Tuesday.\n\nLawyers representing Chicago and Illinois have asked the Supreme Court to continue to block the deployment, calling it a \"dramatic step.\"\n\nAn appeals court said Monday that Trump could take command of 200 Oregon National Guard troops, but a separate court order still blocks him from actually deploying them.\n\nU.S. District Judge Karin Immergut, a Trump appointee, issued two temporary restraining orders earlier this month. One prohibited Trump from calling up the Oregon troops so he could send them to Portland. The other prohibited him from sending any Guard members to Oregon at all after he tried to evade the first order by deploying California troops instead.\n\nThe Justice Department appealed the first order, and in a 2-1 ruling Monday, a 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel sided with the administration.\n\nHowever, Immergut's second order remains in effect, so no troops may immediately be deployed.\n\nThe case is still before the courts.\n\nA 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel in Pasadena is set to hear arguments Wednesday related to Trump's deployment of Guard troops to Los Angeles.\n\nA district court found the administration violated federal law when it sent troops to Los Angeles in early June after protests over Trump's immigration crackdown.\n\nJudge Charles Breyer handed Newsom an early victory in the case on June 13 when he ordered control of California's Guard members back to the state. But in an emergency ruling, an appeals court panel sided with the Trump administration, allowing the troops to remain in federal hands as the lawsuit unfolds.\n\nThe appeals court will weigh whether to vacate Breyer's June order.\n\nThe same three-judge panel is also handling the Trump administration's appeal of a Sept. 2 ruling by Breyer, who found the president violated the Posse Comitatus Act, an 1878 law prohibiting military enforcement of domestic laws.\n\nIn Charleston, West Virginia, a state court hearing is set for Friday in a lawsuit filed by two groups seeking to block deployment of the state National Guard to Washington, D.C. More than 300 Guard members have been in the nation's capital supporting Trump's initiative since late August.\n\nA separate federal court hearing centers on a request by District of Columbia Attorney General Brian Scwalb for a temporary injunction to stop the deployments of more than 2,000 guardsmen.\n\nForty-five states have entered filings in that case, with 23 supporting the administration's actions in D.C. and 22 supporting the attorney general's lawsuit.\n\nRepublican governors from several states also sent units to D.C. Although the emergency period ended in September, more than 2,200 troops remain in the city. Several states told The Associated Press they would bring their units home by Nov. 30, unless extended.\n\nIn Tennessee, Democratic elected officials sued last Friday to stop the ongoing Guard deployment in Memphis. They said Republican Gov. Bill Lee, acting on a request from Trump, violated the state constitution, which says the Guard can be called up during \"rebellion or invasion\" -- but only with the blessing of state lawmakers.\n\nSince their arrival on Oct. 10, troops have been patrolling areas of downtown Memphis, including near the iconic Pyramid, wearing fatigues and protective vests that say \"military police,\" with guns in holsters. Guard members have no arrest power, officials have said.\n\n___\n\nJohnson reported from Seattle. Associated Press writers Mark Sherman in Washington, D.C., Olga R. Rodríguez in San Francisco, Adrian Sainz in Memphis, and John Raby in Charleston, West Virginia contributed to this report.",

Still, Democratic strategists who worried that the party under Joe Biden had for too long ignored cost-of-living issues and the growing frustration around inflation have been happy to see \"affordability\" take center stage. That the cry is being led by a candidate endorsed by the Democratic Socialists of America has even given the term leftist validation -- despite the fact that a decade ago \"affordability\" stood as the vague, squishy descriptor socialists blamed for watering down the goal of universal health care with the Affordable Care Act.",

    "body": "On the 21st day of the federal government shutdown, Gov. Gavin Newsom is blaming the Trump administration and Republican lawmakers for what his office announced will soon be disruptions to millions of Californians' CalFresh food benefits, known federally as SNAP.\n\n\"Trump's failure to open the federal government is now endangering people's lives and making basic needs like food more expensive -- just as the holidays arrive,\" Newsom said in a statement.\n\nNewsom said that more than five million Californians who utilize CalFresh's food assistance could see no money loaded onto their benefit cards in November if the government does not reopen by Thursday.\n\nLocal agencies and food banks are bracing for a potential increase in need due to the delays in food assistance.\n\n\"We are preparing for thousands of additional households coming into our services,\" said Genevieve Pyeatt, director of programs for the Yolo Food Bank.\n\nPyeatt told CBS Sacramento that the Yolo Food Band and the Yolo County Health and Human Services office have teamed up to be proactive, planning right now to host emergency food distributions at CalFresh offices in Davis, Woodland and West Sacramento starting the first week of November to help families if the government does not open back up.\n\n\"Our mission is to provide food to those that are food insecure and to our neighbors. So we take it very seriously,\" Pyeatt said.\n\nPyeatt said the food bank has kept a close eye on the ongoing government shutdown and is preparing for an increase in need for their assistance. They are working to be ready to answer the call of community members, but it comes at a tough time for the agency.\n\n\"We experienced a huge loss in federal cuts already as a food bank, and so we had to adapt to that,\" Pyeatt said. \"Unfortunately, with less food resources, less funds, but still the need increasing, we're always kind of battling with this balance.\"\n\nYolo is one of the most food-insecure counties in California. Pyeatt said the local need is up about 20% over the past three years, and they serve around 30,000 households each month.\n\n\"Thanks to Donald Trump and his MAGA lapdogs in Congress, the government shutdown is going to deprive millions of Californians in need of their November food benefits,\" Newsom wrote on X. \"It is long past time for the GOP to grow a spine, stand up to Trump, and stop endangering people's lives.\"\n\nPresident Trump pushed back on the implication that Republicans are to be blamed for the government shutdown on Tuesday at the White House.\n\n\"From the beginning, our message has been very simple. We will not be extorted on this crazy plot of theirs,\" Mr. Trump said.\n\nRepublican lawmakers like Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R) also point the finger at the other party.\n\n\"We are going to keep voting to open the government and eventually, the Democrats, hopefully sooner or later, will come around,\" said Sen. Thune.\n\nMeanwhile, some California seniors living on a fixed income, like Shari Horne, feel caught off guard with their CalFresh payments in jeopardy.\n\nHorne receives a few hundred dollars a month on her CalFresh card. She cares for her husband with disabilities.\n\n\"We're very concerned. There's a lot of people here that depend on that,\" Horne said. \"It's very challenging. I hadn't thought about what we would do because I didn't know this was going to happen.\"\n\nThe Yolo Food Bank is working to add those emergency food distribution events to their calendar, with dates and times still to be determined.\n\nThe hope is that in the days to come, they will not be needed if the government reopens.\n\nFind food resources near you on their website.

    "body": "With help from Alex Nieves, Camille von Kaenel, Rachel Shin, Grace Yarrow, Timothy Cama and Christa Marshall\n\nPIPELINE POLITICS: California's complex gasoline politics just got knocked on their head.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom has spent years squaring up against the state's refineries in his battle against high gas prices and the political liabilities they pose. First, he tried cracking down on them. Then, he pushed oil-friendly legislation to keep them afloat.\n\nIn the end, an out-of-state pipeline could skirt around the refiners to provide the state with the cheap gasoline Newsom has long craved.\n\nKinder Morgan and Phillips 66 on Monday proposed a Western Gateway Pipeline to carry gasoline, jet fuel and diesel from St. Louis to Southern California. It would be the first pipeline -- ever -- to carry gasoline into the Golden State, eliminating its status as a fuel island, which has long defined its price dynamics.\n\nHow big of a deal would that be for the state?\n\n\"I would say it's big to huge,\" said Ryan Cummings, chief of staff at the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research, noting that a pipeline into the state could reduce reliance on pricey international imports.\n\nThe project would involve Kinder Morgan reversing the flow of an existing pipeline, which currently carries refined fuel from Los Angeles to Phoenix, so that the product instead runs from east to west. Phillips 66 would build a new pipeline from Phoenix to northern Texas, where it could connect with the company's existing Gold Line pipeline, which runs to a refinery outside of St. Louis.\n\nKinder Morgan spokesperson Melissa Ruiz said the same events that sparked Newsom's concern -- Phillips 66's plans to shutter its Los Angeles refinery by year's end, and Valero's Benicia refinery planning to follow suit in April -- \"certainly played a role\" in the move. But so did growing demand for fuel in Phoenix and the company's view that West Coast refiners face higher costs than those in the middle of the country, she said.\n\nState officials had been expecting companies would replace the lost refining capacity with increased imports via ship. But a pipeline can be 10 times cheaper than shipping, according to Tom Kloza, chief oil analyst with Turner Mason & Co., an industry consulting firm. That could give gasoline coming in via pipeline a strong competitive edge over marine-borne fuel and potentially drive down prices in California.\n\n\"It's a project that could move cheap gasoline and diesel from the middle of the country to the West Coast, which has been a very tight market and looks to be tighter the rest of the decade,\" Kloza said.\n\nHowever, it's far from a done deal. Kinder Morgan and Phillips 66 have launched an open season for the proposal, during which other companies can express interest in sending fuel through the pipeline.\n\nAfter that would come a series of federal permissions, potentially including, depending on the exact route of the pipeline, ones to cross federal land, mitigate endangered species impacts and discharge into waterways.\n\nBut they don't envision needing any approval from California agencies to reverse the flow of its pipeline running from Southern California into Arizona, Ruiz said.\n\nIt remains unclear whether California officials will welcome the project. It wasn't included in the Energy Commission's laundry list of ways to maintain an adequate fuel supply that it put out in June.\n\nAssemblymember Cottie Petrie-Norris, chair of the Assembly Utilities and Energy Committee, said in a statement that she was still reviewing the proposal, \"but I continue to be open to exploring all ideas to lower costs.\"\n\nNewsom spokesperson Tara Gallegos did not answer a question on the governor's position on the proposal. The California Public Utilities Commission, which regulates the transportation rates and terms of service of California pipelines carrying petroleum products, also didn't respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe news could be a blow to two groups typically opposed to each other: California refiners and environmentalists.\n\nOn the refiner side, the state's firms might be forced to compete with gasoline coming in from their peers in much friendlier (i.e., cheaper) regulatory environments.\n\nEnvironmental advocacy group The Climate Center, meanwhile, wants state leaders focused on moving away from gasoline, not making it cheaper, said spokesperson Ryan Schleeter.\n\n\"Investment in any new fossil fuel infrastructure is throwing money away,\" he said. \"That is an expensive solution to a short-term problem.\" -- NB\n\nDid someone forward you this newsletter? Sign up here!\n\nRULES OF THE ROAD: State air quality regulators have their timeline for replacing Trump-battered vehicle emission rules.\n\nCalifornia Air Resources Board staff officially launched rulemaking on new standards for light-duty vehicles Tuesday, telling participants during a workshop that a proposal could come up for a vote by summer 2027. That would tee up the agency to submit the rule for federal approval after the 2028 presidential election -- if a Democrat wins.\n\nThe move comes in response to Newsom's June executive order directing CARB to start developing new regulations after President Donald Trump revoked the state's electric vehicle sales mandates for cars and heavy-duty trucks. CARB officials have warned that the state -- which leads the nation in pollutants such as smog-forming nitrogen oxides -- can't meet federal air standards without new rules and could face sanctions, including the loss of federal highway funding.\n\n\"As a result of these illegal and unconstitutional actions by the federal government, we find ourselves and the breathers in California find themselves in an enormous emission reductions hole,\" said Chris Grundler, CARB's deputy executive officer for mobile sources and incentives. -- AN\n\n21ST CENTURY WATER: You used to have to go to a Sacramento office to view in person the millions of water rights records state regulators keep on paper and microfiche. Now, increasingly, you can see them online.\n\nThe State Water Resources Control Board officially rolled out its new digital repository for water rights records Tuesday. The revamped system combines tens of thousands of newly digitized records with a streamlined portal for individuals, companies and water districts with legal claims to California's water to report how much water they've used in the past year.\n\nThe goal is to help regulators (and the public) better understand how the state's water is divided as well as better manage the precious resource, like enforcing restrictions during drought or encouraging groundwater recharge during a flood. One example of a major upgrade: The state is now gathering email addresses for water rights holders for real-time coordination.\n\n\"This access and management is a really powerful new tool that we never had before,\" said Erik Ekdahl, the water board's chief deputy director overseeing water rights. -- CvK\n\nFOFA, FINALLY: The Senate Agriculture Committee voted Tuesday to advance bipartisan legislation that proponents say will help mitigate wildfire risk by overhauling forest management policies, Rachel Shin and Grace Yarrow report for POLITICO subscribers.\n\nThe panel's 18-5 vote on the \"Fix Our Forests Act\" reflects growing momentum for the bill in the wake of worsening fires in the western United States. The bill passed in the House earlier this year and also cleared the chamber last year, but it had previously stalled in the Senate.\n\nSen. Alex Padilla, one of the bill's co-authors, called the move \"real progress toward protecting Americans and our environment through forward-thinking, practical wildfire solutions.\"\n\nTHE CROSSOVER YOU NEEDED: Taylor Swift is into sea otters.\n\nAfter Swift wore a vintage Monterey Bay Aquarium sea otter tee during part of a movie accompanying her new album, the aquarium dug up the original artwork from 1993 and reprinted it for donations. In just a few days, the aquarium had raised over $2 million.\n\nThere's a tie-in to politics, we promise. Julie Packard, the longtime executive director of the aquarium, is making waves of her own: She just gave $500,000 to Newsom's Yes on Prop 50 campaign, according to a campaign finance filing Monday. -- CvK\n\nSUNNY TRAILS: The president of the solar energy industry's main lobbying group is stepping down after nine years at the organization's helm, reports Timothy Cama and Christa Marshall for POLITICO's E&E News.

    "body": "More than five million people across California could see delays in their federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits if the federal shutdown continues, according to a warning from the US Department of Agriculture.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom issued a warning Monday that California residents who depend on SNAP might not see their benefits loaded on their CalFresh cards at the start of the month if the shutdown extends past Thursday.\n\nFive and a half million people get some kind of assistance every month in California to buy groceries. The majority are for low-income seniors or households with children.\n\nCBS News Bay Area talked with one recipient who says he didn't want to give us his name because he was worried his benefits might be shut off for speaking out.\n\nHe said he's working full-time and drives Uber, but it's still not enough to make ends meet.\n\n\"Two hundred and ninety-six dollars [in SNAP benefits] doesn't get you very far when you're feeding a couple of people,\" the unidentified man said, specifying that the $296 is for himself, another adult and two children, and without it, they'll have to make some tough decisions.\n\n\"Either skipping meals, or borrowing money or hoping that more money comes through,\" he said, adding he feels lucky he can drive Uber to help make up the difference, but he's frustrated. He says it's not fair that political gamesmanship is impacting real families.\n\n\"What can you do, you know? What can you do?\" he asks.\n\n\"We are absolutely on the precipice of a hunger emergency,\" said Allison Pratt with the Alameda County Community Food Bank, who expects their organization and other food banks will see a surge in people needing help if the benefits are delayed.\n\n\"SNAP is really our nation's first defense against hunger,\" Pratt said. \"So, am I going to pay rent or am I going to buy groceries this month? These are the decisions people are going to be forced to make.\"\n\nFor families already living paycheck to paycheck, recovering from a financial setback isn't easy.\n\n\"The impact is going to be for a long time here,\" said the unidentified SNAP recipient. \"I don't think we're going to recover anytime soon.\"\n\nIt's not just California that will be impacted. It's food stamp programs in every state that rely on those federal funds. Each state has its own cutoff day to reload the food stamp cards, and for California, that's on Thursday.",

    "title": "Newsom's reparations tightrope",
    "body": "WALKING THE LINE: Democrats running in the last competitive presidential primary discussed reparations for descendants of slaves with a seriousness that seems almost unthinkable during Donald Trump's second administration.\n\nAlthough most stopped short of endorsing cash payments, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and former Housing and Urban Development secretary Julián Castro called for commissions to study the issue. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders faced attacks for declining to support reparations during an appearance on \"The View.\"\n\nGavin Newsom wasn't running in that 2020 primary. But he became one of the few governors to confront the issue when he created a task force to study reparations after the police murder of George Floyd.\n\nNow, as one of the early frontrunners for the 2028 nomination, Newsom is grappling with reparations once again, but in an increasingly anti-DEI environment. Last year, the Democratic governor signed an apology for slavery and racism. And this month, he approved bills creating a state agency to administer reparations programming and initiating a California State University study to determine how Californians can prove they're descendants of slaves.\n\nBut Newsom's recent actions suggest a level of caution, too -- angering some members of the Legislative Black Caucus. He vetoed legislation that would have provided benefits for Californians whose ancestors were enslaved, including homebuying assistance and possible preferential admissions at universities. He also axed a bill that would have helped victims of racist eminent domain.\n\n\"In this particular moment, when there [are] direct threats of harm, and realized harm, coming out of D.C., we're definitely looking for more than half the time showing up with us,\" said caucus Vice Chair Isaac Bryan, who authored the university admissions bill.\n\nNewsom's office declined to comment on his reparations legislation signings and vetoes. But his actions reflected a constituency-balancing approach. Newsom announced he signed the reparations agency bill on \"Higher Learning,\" a podcast hosted by Black progressives. Later in the day, he buried the official signing notice in a news release for broad consumption with dozens of pieces of unrelated legislation.\n\nIt's hard for advocates to argue Newsom is behind the curve, at least in present-day political terms.\n\nNew York is still looking at the topic, with Gov. Kathy Hochul this year pushing to continue a reparations commission through next year. Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, a potential presidential contender, vetoed his state's effort to examine racist inequality, saying he didn't want to pay for \"another study.\"\n\nSo in California, while Newsom is taking some criticism from reparations advocates, they are also celebrating incremental wins.\n\n\"This is one small step for California and one giant leap for the nation when you look at it from that historical perspective,\" said Lisa Holder, a member of the state's reparations-studying task force. \"This is a concrete measure that creates a bureau, creates a division within a state government, and all the resources that come with that, so that you can actually move forward with reparations.\"\n\nIT'S TUESDAY AFTERNOON. This is California Playbook PM, a POLITICO newsletter that serves as an afternoon temperature check on California politics and a look at what our policy reporters are watching. Got tips or suggestions? Shoot an email to [email protected].\n\nCEQA THE CEQUEL: The California Chamber of Commerce filed a ballot initiative today that would overhaul CEQA, California's broadest environmental law, casting it as an effort to spur development and lower housing costs.\n\nThe initiative, titled the \"Building an Affordable California Act,\" aims to push beyond changes to the law passed earlier this summer and streamline the entire CEQA process for \"essential projects,\" arguing that the state's \"outdated system\" is \"too slow, too bureaucratic, and too costly.\"\n\n\"Legislators have previously approved narrow project exemptions, but it's time to actually modernize the 55-year-old law,\" wrote Jennifer Barrera, the president and CEO of Cal Chamber, in an argument for the proposal. \"Californians deserve a law that recognizes prosperity isn't the enemy of preservation.\"\n\nThe initiative proposes a series of changes to streamline CEQA in an effort to cut red tape and limit lawsuits that the chamber says unnecessarily delay projects deemed \"essential\" like affordable housing, clean energy, transportation and wildfire resilience. It would create enforceable deadlines for review, giving government officials one year to approve or deny environmental impact reports, as well as measures to limit the effectiveness of \"frivolous\" NIMBY lawsuits.\n\nWhile the initiative would not require a local government or agency to approve a project, only to make a determination on it, it would provide tangible timelines for developers that often see their projects hang in limbo for years under the current CEQA regime.\n\nThe chamber is aiming to qualify it for the 2026 ballot. -- Will McCarthy\n\nGRAB AND GO: With two weeks left before California's vote on Proposition 50, North Carolina lawmakers are poised to adopt a new congressional map that would allow Republicans to pick up another House seat.\n\nThe state Senate today approved the gerrymandering effort, sending it to the House for final approval, The New York Times reports. Although Gov. Josh Stein is a Democrat, he is unable to veto redistricting bills.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has been directing GOP-led states to redraw their congressional maps to add Republican seats ahead of next year's midterm elections. Texas lawmakers already completed their residistricting effort, and California Democrats conceived Prop 50 in response.\n\nIn North Carolina, state Sen. Ralph Hise explicitly cited Newsom and California, echoing the governor's \"fighting fire with fire\" mantra, CNN reports.\"If Gavin Newsom and his Democrat cronies want to try and take control of Congress to force their liberal agenda on the American people, then we're going to respond in kind,\" he said.\n\nGUARD FIGHT: San Francisco has filed an amicus brief in the Supreme Court case challenging the National Guard deployment in Chicago.\n\nCity Attorney David Chiu: \"Should President Trump make good on his ridiculous threats to send the military to San Francisco, our city is prepared, and my office is prepared to take the necessary legal action to defend San Francisco.\"\n\nDESPERATELY SEEKING SUBSIDIES: Two Californians are among the 13 vulnerable Republicans urging Speaker Mike Johnson to \"immediately turn our focus\" to extending Obamacare subsidies after the government reopens, Benjamin Guggenheim reports.\n\nCentral Valley Rep. David Valadao and Orange County Rep. Young Kim are part of the group led by GOP Reps. Jen Kiggans of Virginia and Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey.\n\nThe members laid out their case today in a new letter to Johnson, reminding him that millions of Americans face skyrocketing health insurance premiums as a result of the expiration of the subsidies at the end of the year.\n\nWhile the moderate members say Republicans must not cede to Democratic demands that the subsidies be extended during the shutdown, they also argue Johnson must help the party \"chart a conservative path\" forward on the credits immediately after the shutdown ends.\n\nIN MEMORIAM: Bob Mulholland, a veteran campaign adviser and longtime fixture in the California Democratic Party, died on Sunday at age 78, KRCR reported.\n\nMulholland, who served in the U.S. Army's 101st Airborne Division during the Vietnam War, was known for his work as a political operative, serving as a superdelegate for the party from 1992 until the 2020 Democratic National Convention, Action News Now reported.\n\nMulholland after retirement largely focused on raising awareness and money for military service members.\n\nPaul Mitchell, who most recently spearheaded California's redistricting effort, described Mulholland's \"endless energy\" as Mitchell and his colleagues were starting their work.\n\n\"I've been happy to stay friends with Bob since then. He would email about stuff all the time and we would always talk when we saw each other,\" Mitchell wrote in a post on X. \"He was great and will be missed.

    "title": "Exclusive -- Elizabeth Barcohana: Newsom's Proposition 50 Will Grow the Hamas Caucus in Washington",
    "body": "California Gov. Gavin Newsom bluffed himself into a gerrymander war that Republicans won before he could even get a shot off. He threatened that California would \"fight fire with fire\" (poor choice of words, Gav) by offsetting the five new GOP seats in Texas with five new Democrat seats in California. But the threat was a bluff.\n\nNewsom gambled that if he just made the threat, Texas would back down or the GOP-controlled House would step in and implement a national ceasefire. But they didn't, and so Newsom accidentally dragged his whole Party into a $100+ million campaign funded, among others, by George Soros and labor unions to put the matter to a vote in a special election in California on November 4, 2025.\n\nProp 50 will amend California's Constitution to suspend the non-partisan maps drawn by the state's Independent Citizens Redistricting Commission, replacing them with partisan maps hastily drawn behind closed doors by a Democrat operative paid by Rep. Nancy Pelosi.\n\nIn the meantime, a handful of red states (whose maps are not drawn by independent commissions of citizens, but by their GOP-controlled state legislatures) continued to redraw their maps and add more GOP seats. So, no matter what the outcome is in California's November 4 special election, the Republicans have successfully increased their majority. Nationally, the Democrats already lost.\n\nBut Prop 50 is still a danger not just for California or Republicans, but for everyone.\n\nIn California, five Republican-held districts could be transformed into Democrat seats, and four vulnerable Democrats sitting in toss up districts will be made safer for re-election. Toss up seats are good for democracy because every vote really counts. As a result, the incumbent is under more pressure to be responsive to his constituents. Prop 50 could eliminate up to nine of California's toss up districts, pre-determining election outcomes, silencing every voter - Democrats, Republicans, and Independents - and incentivizing radical extremism funded by far left special interests.\n\nEliminating toss ups will be a problem for the local down-ballot races that overlap with these nine congressional districts, too. The tens of millions of nationally-funded dollars spent on close congressional campaigns has a cascade effect on both sides. The money trickles down to get out the vote for the down-ballot races. If Prop 50 passes, however, that money will be redirected to other toss up seats in other states, and California state and local candidates will be completely on their own.\n\nThe redirected money on the Democrat side will go to defending their most vulnerable and to mounting offenses against vulnerable Republicans in the House and Senate throughout the country. Democrats flush with cash and enthusiasm will be a formidable challenge for Republicans to meet, and so the balance of power in the House and Senate could ultimately remain fragile in the second half of Trump's term or, worse, the majorities could still be lost.\n\nProp 50 will further radicalize the Democrats elected in California. Safe Democrat districts offer no incentive for candidates or incumbents to moderate. The Democratic Party itself seems to have no interest in moderating; so, we can safely expect that the five Republicans will be replaced by radical leftists.\n\nFor example, in Northern California, the architect of the childhood vaccine mandate schedule in California, Dr. Richard Pan, is challenging Republican Rep. Kevin Kiley, the hero of California parents opposed to pandemic school lockdowns and COVID vaccine mandates. In Southern California, Republican Rep. Darrel Issa will be challenged by Ammar Campa-Najjar, the Palestinian grandson of a founding member of Fatah and organizer of the 1972 Munich Olympics terror attack against the Israeli team. In other words, a male Rashida Tlaib. And each of the other four Republicans, who are consistently pro-Israel, will likely be replaced by a Democrat more reflective of the views held by Zohran Mamdani than Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman.\n\nFinally, Prop 50 is Newsom's soft launch for his presidential campaign and a rollback of Trump's rightward impact on the California electorate. If the measure fails, Newsom's ambitions for the White House can be snuffed out along with it.\n\nThe ramifications are significant and reverberate beyond California's borders. Halfway through the month of early voting, turnout among the opposition appears to be falling short. Prop 50 must be defeated with a national offensive to turn out the vote, and we need all hands on deck.\n\nElizabeth Barcohana is an attorney based in Los Angeles.

    "body": "Dean Fioresi is a web producer for CBS Los Angeles. He covers breaking news throughout Southern California. When he's not writing about local events, he enjoys focusing on sports and entertainment.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom signed hundreds of bills into law this year, taking action on legislation sent to his desk by state lawmakers aimed at addressing some of California's most pressing issues, such as immigration, wildfire recovery and insurance.\n\nHere's what to know about California's new laws and how they could affect you.\n\nIn September, Newsom signed several bills while visiting Los Angeles aimed at enhancing protections for residents affected by ongoing immigration enforcement operations. Among the legislation was Senate Bill 627, called the \"No Secret Police Act,\" which prohibits most local, state and federal law enforcement officers from wearing face coverings while on duty. It also calls for all officers to be identifiable by name and badge number.\n\nA pair of bills, Assembly Bill 49 and Senate Bill 98, provide protections for students amid immigration enforcement operations conducted at schools.\n\nAB 49 prohibits school officials and employees from allowing federal agents conducting immigration enforcement to enter school sites without a warrant, court order or judicial subpoena. SB 98 requires schools to notify parents, teachers, administrators and school personnel of the confirmed presence of immigration enforcement agents and activity on school campuses.\n\nNewsom signed a package of bills on Oct. 10 that he said will \"support the ongoing rebuilding and recovery efforts in Los Angeles after the devastating fires earlier this year.\"\n\nThe legislation signed by Newsom aims to protect homeowners and tenants following a disaster; provide property tax relief for survivors; help workers recover; make insurance work more efficiently for property owners and small business owners; crack down on looting and fire responder impersonation; and reduce further risk of catastrophic wildfire.\n\nThe bipartisan package will also provide additional resources for the state's response and recovery for future disasters. Signed bills include:\n\nThe sale of new Glock handguns will stop in California under Assembly Bill 1127, but the guns won't be illegal to possess or to purchase used.\n\nThe legislation was aimed at addressing the use of \"Glock switches,\" which were already banned in the state but are now easily accessible through 3-D printing. The small switches enable the guns to be modified into fully automatic weapons.\n\nAB 1127 was passed by the California Legislature on a party-line vote, with all Republican assembly members in opposition.\n\nCo-pays on insulin in California will be capped at $35 for 30-day supplies after Newsom signed Senate Bill 40.\n\nAccording to the bill, about 263,000 Californians have type 1 diabetes and rely on daily doses of insulin. Many of the 4 million Californians with type 2 diabetes also need the doses. About one in four insulin users have reported under-usage due to the high costs.\n\nCalRX, the state's program to develop and sell its own prescription medications, will be able to sell the low-cost insulin pens beginning Jan. 1, 2026.\n\nFour bills signed in October are aimed at cracking down on puppy mills and protecting dogs and cats alike.\n\nThree of the bills, AB 506, AB 519 and SB 312, implement new regulations aimed at holding pet sellers accountable by prohibiting third-party pet brokers and requiring dog importers to submit health certificates to the California Department of Food and Agriculture shortly after shipping a pet.\n\nAB 867 bans declawing cats when not medically necessary.\n\n\"Greater transparency in pet purchases will bring to light abusive practices that take advantage of pets in order to exploit hopeful pet owners,\" Newsom said in a statement.\n\nSenate Bill 19 makes it a crime to threaten daycares, schools, universities, workplaces, houses of worship or medical facilities.\n\nThe new law amends existing California law that criminalizes credible threats, clarifying that threats to those facilities are criminal even if a specific person isn't identified.\n\nSenate Bill 576 prohibits streaming services from increasing the volume of commercials above the level of a television show or movie that someone is watching.\n\nFederal law already bans broadcasters from running overly loud commercials, but streaming services were not around when the federal Commercial Advertisement Loudness Mitigation Act was passed in 2010.\n\nSenate Bill 53 targets large artificial intelligence models and implements a number of transparency, reporting and safety requirements that developers must follow in the state.\n\n\"California has proven that we can establish regulations to protect our communities while also ensuring that the growing AI industry continues to thrive,\" Newsom said in a statement after signing the first-in-the-nation bill.\n\nNewsom also signed a package of legislation aimed at protecting children online. New laws include creating protocols for AI chatbots to identify suicidal tendencies in users and requiring companies to clarify that their AI companions are not health care professionals.\n\nApp stores and operating systems must now require age verification for users on products deemed \"inappropriate\" or \"dangerous.\" Under new California law, third parties that knowingly generate or distribute \"deepfake\" pornography may now be held liable in civil court.\n\nAssembly Bill 56 requires warning labels for social media platforms in an effort to warn young users about the downsides of extended usage of those sites.\n\nAssembly Bill 656 forces social media companies to make it straightforward and simple for users to delete their accounts.\n\nAccount cancellations will also delete all personal data from the site's database.\n\nIn an effort to help address California's high housing costs, Newsom signed Senate Bill 79, which allows for more housing construction near major transit stations. Proponents of the bill say that the legislation will also help increase ridership, reduce traffic and pollution, and expand access to jobs and schools.\n\n\"For too long, California has poured billions into transit without building the housing density needed for those systems to reach their potential,\" Newsom said.\n\nAssembly Bill 1264 makes California the first state in the nation to ban ultra-processed food from public school lunches.\n\nLimits on sugars, fats and calories in food items will go into place, as well as bans on certain dyes, including Red 40.\n\n\"For too many students, the meals they receive at school are the only ones they can count on in a day, which makes the quality of that food all the more important,\" First Partner Jennifer Siebel Newsom said. \"By removing the most concerning ultra-processed foods, we're helping children stay nourished, focused, and ready to learn.\"\n\nSenate Bill 518 moves California one step closer toward issuing reparations to descendants of enslaved persons.\n\nThe law establishes the Bureau for Descendants of American Slavery, which is eligible to receive state and federal funding within the Civil Rights Department. The bill states that the bureau's Genealogy Division would then \"verify an individual's status as a descendant.\"\n\nThe law stops short of authorizing the bureau to hand out cash reparations. The state is still determining how to \"address the lasting harms of disenfranchisement, segregation, discrimination, exclusion neglect, and violence impacting both descendants and communities,\" according to the bill's text.\n\nA 19-bill package of bipartisan legislation signed by Newsom is aimed at reducing costs and protecting families by creating stronger consumer protections. The bills signed into law include:\n\nSeveral other bills signed by Newsom specifically aim to protect tenants, including:\n\nAssembly Bill 1340 allows rideshare drivers with services including Lyft and Uber to form a union and negotiate a contract while still being labeled as independent contractors.\n\nIt requires the app-based companies to negotiate with union members in good faith.\n\nProponents of Senate Bill 42 and Senate Bill 398 say the legislation is aimed at protecting California elections against interference from what Newsom called a \"sweepstakes from billionaires seeking to buy elections.\"\n\nSB 42 puts a measure on the November 2026 ballot to repeal a ban on public financing of elections, providing California cities and counties the ability to create publicly financed election programs. Proponents say that it will level the playing field for candidates and reduce the ability to \"buy elections,\" according to the governor's office. SB 398 criminalizes offering payments or valuables to incentivize voters. The crime would be punishable by imprisonment, a fine, or both.\n\nSenate Bill 27 expands the CARE Act, which provides court-ordered services and treatments for those with mental illnesses. The new guidelines force judges to consider CARE Court as a \"frontline option\" for those convicted of misdemeanors who suffer from mental illness as a way to keep them out of the criminal justice system.\n\nA legislative package intended to increase the quality of life for California women includes new regulations on products commonly used by women, such as hair and menstrual products and prenatal vitamins. The legislation signed by Newsom also aims to increase access for women to alternative birth centers.\n\n\"Women in California deserve to have access to quality health care, child care support, and safer products for everyday use,\" Newsom said. \"I'm proud to sign these bills that will continue to address the needs of Californian women and move the needle towards gender equity.\"\n\nUnder Assembly Bill 727, student ID cards at public middle schools, high schools and colleges will be required to display the phone number for The Trevor Project, which provides a 24/7 suicide and crisis hotline for LGBTQ+ youth. This new law expands the state's partnership with The Trevor Project, which has assisted California's own crisis hotline staff with specialized training.\n\nUnder Senate Bill 640, many students can skip the stress of waiting for an acceptance letter to 16 of the 22 California State University campuses.\n\nAs long as high school seniors achieve a 2.0 grade point average and take mandatory \"a-g\" courses, they'll be eligible for admission to the schools under the new law.\n\nThe participating schools are CSU Bakersfield; CSU Channel Islands; Chico State; CSU Dominguez Hills; Cal State East Bay; Fresno State; Cal Poly Humboldt; Cal State LA; Cal State Monterey Bay; CSU Northridge; Sacramento State; Cal State San Bernardino; San Francisco State; Cal State San Marcos; Sonoma State; and Stanislaus State.\n\nStudents who want to attend Cal State Fullerton, CSU Long Beach, Cal Poly Maritime Academy, San Diego State, San Jose State and Cal Poly San Luis Obispo are not automatically accepted with these requirements, and must apply using traditional methods.",

    "title": "Faculty union targets Jewish political money",
    "body": "SHUT OUT -- Jewish advocacy groups and politicians in California are raising alarms over what they say is a growing effort by some on the left to exclude prominent Jewish donors from contributing to candidates for public office.\n\nThe issue flared in recent days over a questionnaire circulated to potential office holders from the California Faculty Association that asks candidates if they've ever accepted money or endorsements from the Jewish Public Affairs Committee of California, a nonpartisan coalition of community groups, or the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, the pro-Israel political lobby -- a decision the faculty group's leaders said stemmed in part from antisemitism legislation that Gov. Gavin Newsom signed into law despite CFA's opposition.\n\n\"Do you have endorsements or take contributions from groups and sectors like AIPAC/JPAC, the Oil Industry, the Tobacco Industry, police associations, etc.?\" the questionnaire reads, noting that the faculty union won't support candidates who accept money from groups that \"harm working people.\"\n\nJewish leaders said they were shocked by the inclusion of JPAC, a coalition that includes a host of Jewish nonprofits, professional associations and several progressive-leaning groups -- and which doesn't make political contributions.\n\nIt's the latest in a series of intraparty rifts that have bitterly divided the California Democratic Party over the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in recent years. Several Jewish state lawmakers say they worry the effort could stoke antisemitism and wrongly associate Jewish people with the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. They said it feels like a push to cancel Jewish voices.\n\n\"I can't for the life of me figure out why some folks at CFA are choosing to spend their time and energy attacking Jewish social services organizations that have literally been at the front lines helping the poor, working families, and immigrant communities,\" Jesse Gabriel, a state lawmaker who co-chairs the Legislature's Jewish Caucus, told Playbook.\n\nMelina Abdullah, chair of CFA's political action and legislation committee, told Playbook that the questionnaire has \"nothing to do with whether or not a candidate is Jewish\" and that \"nowhere in the questionnaire does it say that we're not going to support a candidate if they're supported by JPAC.\" She added that while a candidate's response could warrant \"additional conversation,\" the questionnaire is just one step of the endorsement process.\n\nThe move by the Faculty Association came after it strongly opposed a measure sponsored by JPAC aiming to clamp down on antisemitism in schools. AB 715 -- which was also opposed by the California Teachers Association and nearly every other major education group over academic freedom concerns -- triggered a bruising and emotional fight this year in the Legislature that spiraled into a proxy for Israel's war in Gaza. Debate over the bill revealed fissures among Democrats, some of whom were uncomfortable with what they saw as having to choose between fighting antisemitism and not chilling teachers' speech.\n\nAbdullah said that the CFA's question about JPAC was intended to \"get to the bottom\" of where candidates stood on the measure, which passed the Legislature without a dissenting vote after tough negotiations.\n\n\"We wanted to be clear about that and find out which candidates are affiliated in any way with that effort to censor classroom teachers,\" Abdullah said. \"It's a censorship bill, which threatens the freedom of speech of educators and is also anti-union.\"\n\nThe Arab Resource & Organizing Center, a pro-Palestinian group that helped lead a coalition against AB 715, defended CFA's candidate questions while denouncing JPAC's backing of the antisemitism bill, which it called \"one of this year's most consequential assaults on academic freedom and public education in California.\"\n\n\"In our view, CFA and other unions are not only standing on the right side of history, they are being sensible: The priorities of JPAC don't reflect the priorities of the majority of California voters; it is common sense to withhold an endorsement of any candidate who isn't willing to put the interests of their constituents first,\" said the group's executive director, Lara Kiswani.\n\nBut Marshall Wittmann, a spokesperson for AIPAC, accused CFA of \"ostracizing fellow citizens who are engaged in the democratic process to strengthen the US-Israel partnership\" and of discriminating against pro-Israel Americans.\n\nThe furor over the candidate questions was amplified over the weekend when Democratic organizers in Los Angeles County received an anonymous text message from a sender purporting to represent 15 party delegates who've formed a Free Palestine Caucus. The text demanded candidates not accept any money from donors affiliated with AIPAC, which has a track record of spending heavily in primaries, and called on several state lawmakers to return contributions they've accepted from its president, Michael Tuchin, a prominent donor and Los Angeles lawyer.\n\nMeanwhile, David Bocarsly, JPAC's executive director, called CFA's action \"deeply disheartening and scary,\" accusing the union of playing into \"a trope about Jewish money and Jewish power.\" JPAC is a diverse coalition that focuses on supporting Jewish issues and values at the state level, Bocarsly said, and should not be conflated with AIPAC.\n\nHe stressed that JPAC is an \"ethno-religious community\" rather than an interest group and does not make political contributions or endorse candidates.

Nothing official announced.\n\nLURIE SPEAKS OUT -- San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie on Monday afternoon posted a lengthy, yet measured, response to President Donald Trump's threat of a National Guard deployment to his city: \"I am deeply grateful to the members of our military for their service to our country,\" he wrote, \"but the National Guard does not have the authority to arrest drug dealers -- and sending them to San Francisco will do nothing to get fentanyl off the streets or make our city safer.\"\n\nLurie doesn't mention Trump by name. That's in keeping with his past practice. Lurie, a moderate Democrat, has refrained from railing against Trump, with advisers and allies describing his strategy as, in part, an effort to avoid drawing Trump's attention to San Francisco.\n\nTAKING ON TRUMP -- Trump hasn't threatened to send troops to San Diego, but California's second-largest city may yet find itself in the crosshairs of the administration. On Monday, the City Council gave its initial approval to the \"Due Process and Safety Ordinance,\" a measure intended to set up some additional safeguards for civil liberties amid the administration's aggressive immigration enforcement campaign. The effects of the measure are limited, and it still must undergo further review before coming back to the council for final passage. But the unanimous vote and the nearly 100 people testifying in favor of it, after a weekend \"No Kings\" rally that drew tens of thousands of people to the city's downtown, suggest it has solid prospects.\n\nThe measure would require a judicial warrant for access to non-public municipal facilities or city-funded projects, making it harder to conduct immigration sweeps. It also limits participation in enforcement actions or data-sharing targeting residents based on protected personal characteristics, such as their race, or activities such as exercising free-speech. The city, for example, couldn't share with federal authorities any data related to Saturday's massive \"No Kings\" protest. The law would not prevent the police from working with federal authorities on trafficking cases or other serious matters, nor would it do anything to stop the stepped up enforcement by Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\n\"Sadly, we cannot control the actions of the federal government,\" said City Councilmember Sean Elo-Rivera, the measure's sponsor. \"And the most obvious thing that we can do is to make sure we don't allow a cent of our money, a moment of our time, or a single piece of our data, to be used by the federal government to violate anyone in San Diego's rights.\" -- Ben Fox\n\nFIRST IN PLAYBOOK: FACE TIME -- Blanca Pacheco, a moderate Assembly Democrat, is spending five figures from her ballot measure committee on ads supporting Proposition 50. The digital spots, similar to a cut aired by fellow Los Angeles Assemblymember Mark González, star her and will run only in her district -- effectively melding ballot measure campaigning with name ID building. The ads will begin airing later this week.\n\nFEDERAL REFUGEES -- The government shutdown has put federal paychecks and jobs in limbo. For California, that's another recruitment opportunity. The state has made a series of high-profile hires from federal ranks since formally launching a campaign this spring. Read more about who's making the switch, why, and where they hang out (the Grange) in last night's California Climate.\n\nLONG READ -- Bloomberg's Joshua Green and Eliyahu Kamisher's new profile on Gavin Newsom as likely presidential contender covers the arc of his political evolution, which will be familiar to insiders, along with fresh details -- from how he holed up at home with his friend Doug Hendrickson and a bottle of tequila after a week at the frontlines of the Los Angeles wildfires to his horror at discovering his teenage son's apparent belief that the far-right influencer Andrew Tate is \"innocent\" of the rape and human trafficking charges British authorities filed against him and his brother, Tristan.\n\n\"Newsom gives a horrified look as he recounts the conversation. \"Like, what? How do you even know who this guy is? What do you mean he's innocent? He goes, 'All my friends, we all know he's innocent.'\"\n\nIn a lighter scene, it describes Newsom on a Twitch stream with the YouTube creator ConnorEatsPants with \"the slightly desperate energy of a dad trying to impress his daughter's prom date.\"\n\n\"Sensing a connection, Newsom let slip that he owns a pair of Snoop Dogg Skechers. But his host sounded unimpressed. EatsPants was also unfamiliar with Prop 50, to his playing partner's evident dismay. 'I'm iterating,' Newsom said, 'I'm trying.'\"\n\nNATIONAL GUARD EXTENSION -- The deployment of roughly 300 California National Guard troops has been extended through February, according to an amicus brief from Newsom filed Monday in the Supreme Court.\n\nIn the brief, filed in Trump v. Illinois, lawyers for California write: \"It has become clear that the federal government's actions in Southern California earlier this summer were just the opening salvo in an effort to transform the role of the military in American society,\" lawyers for California write in the amicus brief. \"At no prior point in our history has the President used the military this way: as his own personal police force, to be deployed for whatever law enforcement missions he deems appropriate.\" (San Francisco Chronicle)\n\n-- Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass and Rep.

    "body": "To the editor: I'm a bit confused about the timing of the Marine Corps showcase event at Camp Pendleton (\"Interstate 5 closure brings gridlock, new battle between Trump, California,\" Oct. 18). The Marine Corps' actual 250th anniversary isn't until Nov. 10, three weeks from now. It seems a bit strange to stage a celebration of this magnitude so early, especially because it just happened to coincide with the \"No Kings\" marches.\n\nAs far as shutting down Interstate 5 goes, Gov. Gavin Newsom was right in taking this action. Shooting live ammunition over the freeway is not business as usual. Common sense would warn you of the dangers of such an action. The assertion by the White House that this is safe simply can't be true.\n\nTo the editor: I find it ironic and poetic that shrapnel from the military exercise struck a California Highway Patrol vehicle assigned to protect Vice President JD Vance (\"Shrapnel fell onto CHP vehicle during U.S. military live-fire exercise over I-5, agency says,\" Oct. 19). Despite the protestations of freeway users and the military, Newsom chose to close the freeway to avoid the very thing that occurred. We should be grateful that we have a governor who puts public safety over public opinion.",

    "title": "Los Angeles copper wire theft is leaving communities in the dark. How is it getting fixed?",
    "body": "As surging copper wire thefts are leaving many Los Angeles communities in the dark, a new statewide metal theft law set to kick in next year is aimed at recyclers who buy the stolen metal.\n\nLos Angeles city leaders, law enforcement and business leaders called on Governor Gavin Newsom to sign Assembly Bill 476 \"Metal Theft,\" as copper wire theft has cost communities not only money, but safety.\n\nThe Sixth Street Bridge in downtown Los Angeles, originally called the \"Ribbon of Light,\" is a glaring example, as it sits in darkness with seven miles of copper wire stolen and stripped from the 2023-built bridge.\n\nWhile the stolen copper is valued at $11,000, repairs to rewire it for lighting are estimated to cost over $2.5 million - and have yet to be completed.\n\nSimilar wire theft crime scenes play out throughout the county, including around the Cahuenga Pass. Joy Taylor says her streetlights have been out for eight months, since February.\n\n\"I not only worry about cars not seeing us, but we have a lot of wildlife in this neighborhood, and there's coyotes that are coming through the area,\" Taylor said.\n\nIn Encino, five streetlights are out of commission on a single block, leaving one couple to alter their evening walks with their aging father because of it.\n\n\"Unfortunately, because of the cracks in the sidewalk, my dad's 83 years old, he can't see, and you know, myself as well, I will trip on the cracks. You just can't walk at night, you can't when it's pitch black,\" Elayne said.\n\nCBS News California Investigates obtained and analyzed city data and found that there have been more than 37,000 streetlight repair requests made so far in 2025. As of September, more than half are still waiting for service.\n\nThe Bureau of Street Lighting said through an email statement that 15% of the system is affected by outages.\n\nLA County District Attorney Nathan Hochman said that broken streetlights have life and death consequences. He noted the downtown Los Angeles shooting death of actor Johnny Wactor.\n\n\"He got killed because three individuals were trying to steal his catalytic converter. But why did they choose Johnny Wactor's car at 3 a.m. at that exact spot? Because the streetlights were out --it was dark,\" Hochman said.\n\nThe Bureau says nearly half of its service requests are due to wire theft, and the other half are routine maintenance. This leads to a nine to 12-month period before repairs can be made, as there are less than 200 field staff to cover the city's quarter of a million streetlights.\n\nLos Angeles Councilmember Nithya Raman represents the district that includes the Cahuenga Pass and she said she is constantly getting calls about broken streetlights. \"To me, it's unacceptable that it takes up to a year to fix a broken streetlight,\" Raman said.\n\nShe's calling for an update to property assessment rates, to fund streetlight maintenance as the fees haven't been adjusted since the 90s.\n\nNeighbors in the Cahuenga Pass have taken matters into their own hands by pooling money to install their own streetlights. Residents Martha Carr and Joy Taylor said they aren't waiting for the city to come to the rescue, and instead are subsidizing a city service with two motion-activated lights.\n\n\"Well, in a strange way, I felt empowered that I was able to do something myself, but I shouldn't have to,\" Carr said.\n\nMayor Karen Bass' Office responded by email, saying the city is \"embracing new and innovative technologies like solar lighting,\" moving away from copper wire. \"Mayor Bass has begun that work as hundreds of solar streetlights have been installed,\" the Mayor's Office wrote.\n\nAssembly member Mark González authored AB 476, stating that \"Copper wire theft is not a victim-less crime.\"\n\nThe bill puts more responsibility on junk dealers when purchasing scrap metal, leaving thieves with fewer options when selling. Buyers will be required to verify the seller's identity and lawful ownership. Certain scrap metal from streetlights and traffic signals will be illegal to possess, and the bill also increases penalties for recyclers who purchase materials that belong to public entities without ensuring the seller has proper authorization to do so.\n\n\"Every stolen wire is more than metal ripped from the ground; it's light ripped from our communities,\" González said.\n\nThe city is also working on a Metal and Wire Theft Reward Program, where rewards of $5,000 would be offered for information leading to felony grand theft charges and $1,000 for misdemeanor charges involving city-owned metal thefts, including copper wiring, plaques, streetlight parts and more.",

Gavin Newsom and Proposition 50 displayed on an electronic traffic sign in recent days.\n\nThe sign, which read \"F--- Newscum No on 50,\" appeared near Fair Oaks Boulevard and Old Auburn Road and was visible for at least two nights.\n\nIn a statement, the City of Citrus Heights said the message board, which was not owned or controlled by the city, had been tampered with by an unknown party.\n\n\"The message board is owned and operated by a third-party traffic safety contractor, Sierra Safety, and was accessed by an unknown party without authorization,\" the city said in a statement. \"The City does not own or manage the board's programming. We are confident our contracting partners will implement appropriate safeguards to prevent future incidents.\"\n\nCity officials said the issue was resolved the same day they were notified.\n\nA representative for Sierra Safety told CBS Sacramento the company only sells or rents traffic message boards and does not manage or program them.\n\nCalifornia voters will decide on Proposition 50 in a November 4 special election. The measure, if passed, would shift five of California's U.S. House seats to be more favorable to Democrats in the 2026 midterm elections. It's meant to counter the recent congressional redistricting in Texas that favors Reoublicans.\n\nIt remains unclear who was responsible for changing the sign's message.",

    "title": "Newsom warns Californians' SNAP benefits could be delayed because of federal shutdown",
    "body": "Newsom's warning followed similar alerts from members of both parties in other states.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom issued a stark warning Monday that food assistance benefits for millions of low-income Californians could be delayed starting Nov. 1 if the ongoing federal shutdown does not end by Thursday.\n\nThe benefits, issued under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, and formerly called food stamps, include federally funded benefits loaded onto CalFresh cards. They support some 5.5 million Californians.\n\nNewsom blamed the potential SNAP disruption -- and the shutdown more broadly -- on President Trump, and slammed the timing of the potential cutoff just as the Thanksgiving holiday approaches.\n\n\"Trump's failure to open the federal government is now endangering people's lives and making basic needs like food more expensive -- just as the holidays arrive,\" Newsom said. \"It is long past time for Republicans in Congress to grow a spine, stand up to Trump, and deliver for the American people.\"\n\nThe White House responded by blaming the shutdown on Democrats, as it has done before.\n\nAbigail Jackson, a White House spokeswoman, said the \"Democrats' decision to shut down the government is hurting Americans across the country,\" and that Democrats \"can choose to reopen the government at any point\" by voting for a continuing resolution to fund the government as budget negotiations continue, which she said they repeatedly did during the Biden administration.\n\n\"Newscum should urge his Democrat pals to stop hurting the American people,\" Jackson said, using a favorite Trump insult for Newsom. \"The Trump Administration is working day and night to mitigate the pain Democrats are causing, and even that is upsetting the Left, with many Democrats criticizing the President's effort to pay the troops and fund food assistance for women and children.\"\n\nCongressional Republicans also have blamed the shutdown and resulting interruptions to federal programs on Democrats, who are refusing to vote for a Republican-backed funding measures based in large part on Republican decisions to eliminate subsidies for healthcare plans relied on by millions of Americans.\n\nNewsom's warning about SNAP benefits followed similar alerts from other states on both sides of the political aisle, after the U.S. Department of Agriculture warned state agencies in an Oct. 10 letter that the shutdown may interrupt funding for the benefits.\n\nStates have to take action to issue November benefits before the month ends, so the shutdown would have to end sooner than Nov. 1 for the benefits to be available in then.\n\nNewsom's office said Californians could see their benefits interrupted or delayed if the shutdown is not ended by Thursday. The Texas Health and Human Services Department warned that SNAP benefits for November \"won't be issued if the federal government shutdown continues past Oct. 27.\"\n\nNewsom's office said that a cutoff of funds would impact federally funded CalFresh benefits, but also some other state-funded benefits. More than 63% of SNAP recipients in California are children or elderly people, Newsom's office said.\n\nIn her own statement, First Partner of California Jennifer Siebel Newsom said, \"Government should be measured by how we protect people's lives, their health, and their well-being. Parents and caregivers should not be forced to choose between buying groceries or paying bills.\"\n\nStates were already gearing up for other changes to SNAP eligibility based on the Republican-passed Big Beautiful Bill, which set new limits on SNAP benefits, including for non-working adults. Republicans have argued that such restrictions will encourage more able-bodied adults to get back into the workforce to support their families themselves.\n\nMany Democrats and advocacy organizations that work to protect low-income families and children have argued that restricting SNAP benefits has a disproportionately large impact on some of the most vulnerable people in the country, including poor children.\n\nAccording to USDA, about 41.7 million Americans were served by SNAP benefits per month in fiscal 2024, at an annual cost of nearly $100 billion. The USDA has some contingency funding it can utilize to continue benefits in the short term, but does not have enough to cover all monthly benefits, advocates said.\n\nAndrew Cheyne, managing director of public policy at the advocacy group End Child Poverty California, urged the USDA to utilize its contingency funding and any other funding stream possible to prevent a disruption to SNAP benefits, which he said would be \"disastrous.\"\n\n\"CalFresh is a lifeline for 5.5 million Californians who rely on the program to eat. That includes 2 million children. It is unconscionable that we are only days away from children and families not knowing where their next meal is going to come from,\" Cheyne said.\n\nHe said the science is clear that \"even a brief period of food insecurity has long-term consequences for children's growth and development.\"\n\nTed Lempert, president of Children Now, said a disruption would be \"horrific.\"\n\n\"We speak out for the needs of kids and families, and kids need food -- basic support to live and function and go to school,\" he said. \"So this could be really devastating.\"",

    "body": "With help from Noah Baustin, Alex Nieves and Benjamin Storrow\n\nGO WEST, FEDERAL WORKERS: The ongoing government shutdown is leaving federal paychecks and jobs in limbo. California's smelling a recruitment opportunity.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom's campaign to recruit former federal workers has yielded a steady stream of job applications from former federal workers since its launch in March, at the peak of the Elon Musk-led job cuts that saw tens of thousands leave the federal workforce. Applications peaked in May at 314 but have largely kept up, numbering 239 in September, according to state data provided to POLITICO.\n\nCalifornia hiring officials have also created a website and information sessions specifically targeted at former federal workers (they have not, however, run ads in Washington, D.C., metro stations, like New York).\n\nThe result is at least dozens of hires, from entry-level staff to high-profile scientists and regulators with decades of federal experience who moved West to preserve their life's work and lead California departments at the front lines of backfilling federal rollbacks.\n\nNow, the state is hoping to further capitalize on that insider experience as this spring's deferred resignations start running out and the White House drafts further layoff plans (which a judge paused last week, for now.) The state currently has about 3,000 job postings across all agencies and counties.\n\n\"We are open to federal workers coming into state service, and we've made no secret about that,\" said California Environmental Protection Secretary Yana Garcia.\n\nGarcia's agency has stuffed its leadership ranks with former federal workers amid a broad federal rollback of environmental rules, funding and jobs. (By some estimates, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is on track to lose 1 out of 3 workers by early 2026.) That's been helpful as California reacts to federal attacks on its environmental policies, like Trump's revocation of the state's gas-powered vehicle phase-out, said Garcia.\n\n\"It's been very helpful to have people who understand very well the reality that other states also face,\" Garcia said. \"It allows us to have context across the nation.\"\n\nCalifornia's high-profile hires include Kris Thayer, previously U.S. EPA's director of the chemical and pollution assessment division and now the director of the state Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment; former U.S. EPA biopesticides division director Madison Le, who joined the Department of Pesticide Regulation as a top deputy in April; former U.S. EPA Region 9 air director Matt Lakin, since August the new California Air Resources Board division chief overseeing air quality, planning and science; and the former director of U.S. EPA's offices of transportation and air quality and atmospheric science, Chris Grundler, who joined CARB in May as deputy executive officer for mobile sources and incentives.\n\nNewsom also appointed Andrew Rakestraw, a former top State Department climate negotiator, to chair the California Board of Environmental Safety, in April.\n\nIt's not a coincidence the high-profile hires have focused on the environment: Newsom specifically called out federal workers with experience in \"firefighting, weather forecasting and modeling, natural resources management, medical and mental health and the sciences\" in his March executive order.\n\nAccording to spokespeople, the California Environmental Protection Agency has hired nine former federal workers this year; the California Energy Commission and the Department of Conservation have each hired eight; and the Department of Fish and Wildlife three. Data for other agencies was not immediately available.\n\nThe former U.S. EPA workers now in state government, who refer to themselves as \"migrants,\" have a group chat going and have gathered for happy hour at least once (at the swanky Grange Restaurant & Bar in Sacramento).\n\n\"Unless you were really part of the federal system and saw the way this unraveled, it's really hard to share that with people who weren't part of it,\" Thayer said in an interview.\n\nShe left her job after decades of federal service on May 9; three days later, she was in Sacramento. The decision came as she saw \"strong headwinds\" for her agency, she said, and her personal life allowed for a cross-country move, which is not a given for federal workers concentrated in and around Washington, D.C.\n\nUnder Trump 2.0, she sees an even greater role for her new state agency, which evaluates public health risks from various contaminants and makes science-based recommendations to regulators.\n\n\"We are certainly looking to increase our coordination between states so that we can really maximize and amplify our work,\" she said. \"Absolutely, we're expecting to have to backfill.\"\n\nSince coming to Sacramento, she's also connected former federal coworkers with California openings, with some success, she said. She expects a wave of interest as the deferred resignations thousands of federal workers signed up for this spring come to term.\n\nGrundler, an architect of federal clean car rules who spent 42 years at U.S. EPA, came out of retirement in southern France for the California job. He was so eager that he signed a lease for an apartment in Sacramento sight unseen and moved within weeks, he said in an interview.\n\n\"It was just heartbreaking to watch the systematic dismantling of my and colleagues' life's work,\" Grundler said. \"I needed to feel as though I was at least trying to do something, because there's just so much at stake.\"\n\nHe's now brainstorming other ways to bring car pollution down, including possible new incentives or new regulations, though nothing concrete has yet emerged. He's hoping to use his longtime ties with automakers in Michigan, where he grew up, to keep encouraging electric vehicle sales in the country's most populous state.\n\n\"I knew it was going to be challenging, but I really didn't have a choice,\" Grundler said. \"I have no regrets.\" -- CvK\n\nDid someone forward you this newsletter?

Now, one of those closures is officially in motion.\n\nPhillips 66 announced earlier this month that it received its final shipment of waterborne crude oil to its Los Angeles refinery and expected its final crude processing date to be around Oct. 16.\n\n\"The Los Angeles Refinery has begun idling as planned, with active fuel production stopping at the end of 2025,\" Phillips 66 spokesperson Al Ortiz said in a statement Monday. He confirmed that several units of the refinery have already been idled, and the remaining units will be phased out through the end of the year. He declined to say whether the plant was still producing gasoline.\n\nWork at the refinery is continuing past that Oct. 16 crude oil processing sunset date, said Dave Campbell, United Steelworkers Local 675 field director, whose union represents many of the site's workers. The company told the union that after it stopped processing crude oil, it would feed down the material in its inventory tanks for up to 45 days, according to Campbell.\n\nEven after the refinery does eventually shutter, Phillips 66 plans to continue operating in California, according to Ortiz. The company has a marine terminal in the Port of Los Angeles and fuel product terminals, and their associated pipelines, in LA and Torrance. The firm will keep all of that online, allowing it to import gasoline from out of state, including California-grade gasoline from its Ferndale refinery in Washington.\n\nPhillips 66 will funnel that fuel, along with the renewable diesel from its Rodeo Renewable Energy Complex, to the roughly 600 independently-owned gas stations that use its 76, Conoco or Phillips 66 brands in the state. -- NB\n\nIT'S ALL INFRASTRUCTURE: Democrats and Republicans are pointing fingers at each other's stances on renewable energy for rising electricity prices across the nation, but the real picture is more complicated.\n\nA new study by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory found that utility repairs -- not power purchases -- are largely responsible for the 23 percent increase in electricity prices over the last five years. And as those repairs of aging infrastructure become more frequent, the price tag is being pushed up further by extreme weather and a shortage of grid components, Benjamin Storrow reports for POLITICO's E&E News.\n\nCalifornia is a key example of the impact that spending on power lines has on residents' bills. Power distribution infrastructure accounted for 44 percent of California utilities' capital expenditures in 2023 and has risen steadily since 2019, according to a separate report from Berkeley Lab last year. Meanwhile, spending on energy generation fell over that same period, amounting to 25 percent of capital expenditures in 2023.\n\nThe Lawrence Berkeley report pointed to wildfire damages as the underlying reason for California's high electricity costs, while storm damage is the culprit in states like Florida and Maine. -- BS, AN\n\nON THE SCHEDULE: U.S. senators are set to take a long-awaited vote on a bipartisan bill targeting wildfire risk on Tuesday.\n\nThe Senate Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee is scheduled to hear -- and likely pass -- the Fix Our Forests Act, a version of which already passed the House of Representatives with bipartisan support. The bill would still need a full vote in the Senate.\n\nSen. Alex Padilla (D-Calif.) is a co-author of the bill, along with GOP Sens. John Curtis and Tim Sheehy and Democratic Sen. John Hickenlooper. The legislation aims to speed up wildfire prevention projects like vegetation thinning in national forests and boost firefighting technology. -- CvK\n\n-- Youth organizers are planning a school walkout Friday in support of the Polluters Pay Climate Superfund Act, a proposal to hold companies liable for climate damages that stalled this session.\n\n-- The point of view of visiting Arches National Park during the shutdown.\n\n-- Most Sonoma County agricultural workers have worked during wildfires, and many felt health effects afterward, a new UC Berkeley survey found.\n\nCALIFORNIA POLICY IS ALWAYS CHANGING: Know your next move.
