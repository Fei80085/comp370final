"Republicans take stock of Newsom, a 'Tier 1 Democrat' after Prop 50","One Republican strategist said Newsom's winning redistricting campaign in California transformed him into a top rival of Donald Trump,"" while another conceded it had cemented him as a ""Tier 1 Democrat.""

The passage of California's redistricting measure, Proposition 50, said Matthew Bartlett, a Republican strategist and former Trump administration appointee, represented ""the rise of Gavin Newsom as a prime political opponent of Donald Trump.""

While Newsom had been at the forefront of Democrats' opposition to Trump for months, Bartlett said, winning Proposition 50 delivered a tangible political victory in a face-off with the president. For Newsom, the high-profile fight over redistricting served as a springboard for the term-limited governor to cultivate political capital with Democrats and expand his small-dollar donor base across the country ahead of his likely presidential run. As Trump and his allies mount pressure campaigns in Republican-led states to redraw their congressional districts ahead of the 2026 midterm elections, Newsom's explicit swing at Trump's overreach proved successful, to the chagrin of Republican leaders-in-waiting who have yet to begin a serious exploration of who could take up the MAGA mantle in 2028. One person close to Trump's orbit, granted anonymity to discuss the White House's thinking, said while the outcome was expected, ""Newsom has done a good job of cementing as a Tier 1 Democrat.""

Ahead of the election, the president aired his frustration with Newsom's redistricting push and said on Truth Social that it was ""unconstitutional"" and ""a giant scam.""
