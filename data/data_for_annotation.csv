"America, the Juvenile","The Trump administration is a regime of troubled grade-schoolers. In 1949, the German historian and political philosopher Hannah Arendt visited Europe for the first time since fleeing to America during the war. A year later, she wrote an analysis of what she called ""the aftermath of Nazi rule."" She found the Old World lacking in civic maturity and commitment compared with her new home, the then-booming United States, noting that ""the peoples of Western Europe have developed the habit of blaming their misfortunes on some force out of their reach."" She believed that her adopted country, by comparison, enjoyed a kind of clarity of public vision: ""With the possible exception of the Scandinavians,"" she wrote, ""no European citizenry has the political maturity of Americans, for whom a certain amount of responsibility, i.e., of moderation in the pursuit of self-interest, is almost a matter of course.""

The Department of Justice will deploy federal election observers to monitor sites in Tuesday's elections in California and New Jersey. This would usually be seen as a routine mission from the department's Civil Rights Division, which is tasked with ensuring federal election laws are followed across the country. But the precise areas of deployment, the absence of clear federal authority to oversee these specific races and the questionable pretext for their deployment all set a disturbing precedent that will likely expand during next year's midterm elections.

Arnold Schwarzenegger shared his two cents on Governor Gavin Newsom's Prop 50 measure on ""Real Time With Bill Maher"" Friday evening, where he slammed the political move as ""a big scam.""

The actor, who served as the 38th Governor of California between 2003 and 2011, made it clear he wasn't a fan of Newsom's measure, which will authorize temporary changes to the state's congressional district maps -- directly combating similar action being done in Texas. While Newsom has touted Prop 50 as a way to stop President Donald Trump and the Republican party from being able to ""rig the next election,"" Schwarzenegger accused it as evidence of unethical ""gerrymandering"" in today's politics. ""Do you know who I want to win?",TheWrap
